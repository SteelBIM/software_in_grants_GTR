The project is divided into two main stages. The first will develop new 'Perspectives' on the current portfolio based on existing 'Grants on the Web' data, the second will use spinout workshops to kick-start the use of the Perspectives and provide feedback on best practice from cross-ICT meetings.
In the first phase we will use text mining and simple visualisation techniques to provide 'at a glance' overviews of the portfolio in the form of word-clouds or similar intuitive presentations. All terminology will be derived from the community, either from the grant summaries and titles or by canvassing the community directly. The 'at a glance' views will also provide the top level of an intuitive navigation system which will allow users to rapidly drilldown to project and investigator descriptions using the natural structure inherent in 'Grants on the Web' and derived using text mining.

As well as being viewable on the web these Perspectives will also be available as a set of standalone materials and associated tools for ICT strategy and Network workshops. They will provide an accessible overview of the portfolio and its natural structure. The latter will be presented in interactive dendrogram form to allow easy partitioning for scoping more detailed workshop breakout sessions.

The second phase of the project will focus on networking. Six 'spinout' workshops will be organised by open call that will make use of Perspectives' materials and tools to facilitate brainstorming and road-mapping type activities. Meetings that bring together two or more Networks will be especially sought.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe that the most important impact will be on future ICT research as the project aim is to transform the way in which researchers, and other stakeholders, contribute to the formulation of strategy. The project will provide the type of structured overview, expressed in the community's own terms and derived from the community's own data, that will enable participants to contribute efficiently, collegiately and meaningfully to such processes.

Furthermore, we believe that the creation of snapshot Perspectives for other EPSRC, Research Council, and possibly EU Framework sectors, has significant potential both to promote ICT and allow the project to be of significant use to a much wider audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186601</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC Network of Networks (NoN) and ICT Perspectives Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A646E261-83FC-4677-9B8F-06513DB18674</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 academics and members of EPRSC met at a meeting we organised in conjunction with EPSRC to discuss the current research of the EPSRC ICT Networks, the progress of the Network of Networks meetings, and of Network 'best practice'.

The awareness of the Networks of each other and of themselves to the outside world and EPSRC was increased, thanks to the attendance of approximately 20 of the Network leads.

a. the research coverage of the networks;
b. their research challenges and relationships;

d. their coverage of the ICT research landscape.

The main impact from this meeting was the creation of an EPSRC Network of Networks Meeting Report which shed light on the coverage of the EPSRC networks in relation to their research and where possible overlaps might be.
The major items of the document are:
a. a structured challenge map;
b. an ICT topic map showing each network's research coverage;
c. a summarising chord diagram and individual network proformas that identify potential collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.well-sorted.org/explore/NetworkOfNetworks2014/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Economy Spring Strategy Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97F684C8-B899-419A-B7AB-DFEA1AAADA97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Research Councils UK (RCUK) Digital Economy Theme was seeking to identify new priorities to help shape its future portfolio and strategic direction.
