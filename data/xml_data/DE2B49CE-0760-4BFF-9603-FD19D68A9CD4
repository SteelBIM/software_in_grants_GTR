The industrial partners, Sogreah Consultants, and Baird &amp;amp; Associates, are world leaders in Coastal Engineering and have committed considerable financial support. This project exploits the VGW EPSRC project in which numerical models were developed.To meet this century's challenge of extensive and accelerating future coastal change, society will expect coastal engineers to design resilient structures to hold the line against flood and erosion where it is deemed necessary. The first choice construction material and design approach for such structures will often be to use armour layers of massive rocks or concrete units. Currently, designers do not understand the details of how they work, relying heavily on empirical methods. This project will reveal fundamental mechanisms that cause disintegration of these rubble mound coastal structures and breakwaters. With our further enhanced simulation tools we will re-create the construction process, examine inherent heterogeneity, explore unit shapes and their interaction with under-layer rock geometry, examine scale effects, and use vibration and other proxies for wave disturbance, all to study block motion, contact force and stress heterogeneity and risk of concrete unit breakages.The aims are to:(1) Promote a shift in design approach from empirical to scientifically-determined damage and breakage probabilities. This requires modelling the solid geometry together with both the static and transient dynamic stress states within gigantic granular systems of complex-shaped concrete units and rock armour used in coastal structures and breakwaters, during construction, when at rest and as perturbed by external forces. (2) Extend the stress and deformation analysis tools of our world-leading 3D FEMDEM modelling technology that combines the multi-body interaction and motion modelling (i.e. Discrete Element Model, DEM) with the ability to model internal deformation of arbitrary shape (Finite Element Model, FEM) to the point where they can be readily harnessed to deliver a more fundamental understanding of a wide range of environmental and industrial problems.The layers of concrete units and rocks targeted in this coastal research are an extreme case of particulate or granular media intensively studied by physicists, with solid-like behaviour dominating but potentially fluid-like behaviour possible, should they become unravelled in a storm. Scientists have long been able to see stresses in photo-elastically deformed grain pack experiments using any 2D grain shapes, but have had no such property or tool to interrogate our real-world 3D granular systems. This is all about to change following research by the PI and co-workers - the development of a generic 3D computer model based on FEMDEM developed under our VGW EPSRC grant. No other model (presented in the literature) handles multi-body dynamics of complex-shaped deformable particles with greater accuracy, capturing the stress components everywhere in time and space. This project will bring fresh modelling capability to both fundamental science and engineering applications of granular materials. Information about temporal and spatial heterogeneity of stress will become available to underpin the workings at the heart of our currently limited understanding of granular material behaviour that is so vexing the physicists.Applications of numerical models to loading and collapse of silos, mineral and powder processing/handling, avalanching, and geotechnics have all been attempted using DEM. Upgrading DEM to FEMDEM, taking account of deformability, dynamics and the angularity/complexity of particle shape in these multi-body systems will significantly improve simulations, extending applications to unprecedented fields such as biomechanics and nuclear systems, too numerous to list here.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>APPLICATION TO COASTAL STRUCTURES targets broader societal needs in times of increasing storminess, sea level rise, and a drive to exploit marine renewables: (a) to develop next generation numerical tools for structure and wave-structure technologies for coastal engineers - hence this addresses the mission of both Energy and Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) research programmes of EPSRC and (b) to provide Industry and Government with more accurate and robust science to innovate in design, help evaluate flood risk and ensure public confidence in the safety of coastal structures well into the 21st century. Rock and concrete unit armoured coastal structures, and structures to protect tidal energy harnessing lagoons, barrages and offshore wind and wave energy farms will use design methods born out of this project's research on granular solids and from fluid/granular structure numerical methods developed in later research phases. It is estimated that across Europe, the value of yearly coastal construction based on rubble mound methods is in excess of 1 billion Euros with breakwater asset values often exceeding 200m and a long-term annual UK flood defence spend requirement of 1b announce by EA (30.06.09). Dr Latham was heavily involved in the Rock Manual (2007) and has well established links with all key UK (and European) stakeholders in rubble structures. They include Government, Infrastructure and Client Organisations: DEFRA/EA, DTI, Local authorities, Network Rail; Consultants: Halcrow, WS Atkins, Royal Haskoning, High-Point Rendel; Contractors: Royal Boskalis Westminster, Van Oord UK, Nuttal; Materials Suppliers: concrete, aggregates, quarry companies e.g. CEMEX. Working with the world's leading unit designers, this project will position UK researchers at the heart of design innovations. With the international pace of numerical modelling, it is reasonable to suggest that within 5-10 years, coastal engineering research groups will use wave-structure numerical models to show realistic armour unit movement and stresses under simulated design wave climates. This may be expected to transfer into routine design practice, often replacing the need for flume models, within say 10-15 years. At key conferences, it will be possible through presentations and exhibits to engage designers and contractors, through visualisation of simulation results, to demonstrate the consequences of different construction practices that either improve or compromise performance in terms of interlocking, stability and dynamic tensile stress development. THE MODELLING TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH into developing further the FEMDEM software will impact on many researchers (PhD, Postdocs whether academic or industry led) of particle or blocky systems interactions, through the software's ability to tackle complex problems and its accessibility, compared with commercial tools. The range of environmental and industrial sectors to benefit from submodel enhancements to the FEMDEM codes already available on VGW are numerous, especially when taken together with the planned further coupling of solids FEMDEM with AMCG's generic fluids codes, FLUIDITY &amp;amp; ICOM. VGW was conceived with a focus on geoscience and geoengineering, but as the FEMDEM/fluids modelling technology becomes more versatile, the potential sectors for exploitation go much wider and include: resilience to extreme events (flood, avalanche), carbon capture, porous/fractured blocky rock-mass engineering, soil engineering, particulate processing, biomechanics and nuclear engineering. To ensure good engagement and communication, following the success of the VGW launch workshop, we will continue to run modelling technology hands-on workshops, use Encora (new European coastal network and Wiki) to promote a workshop and regular group meetings to link with other European Coastal research groups, publish journal and conference papers and webpages and include media relations, through the IC Press Office.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>475826</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>WF Baird &amp; Associates</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Coastal Engineering Industrial Partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D39EA4D-D534-4033-B4D3-BC985339BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference Papers

Note: the findings have prompted the funding of a follow-up Impact Acceleration EPSRC project to help deliver impact. 

The follow-up project NBWPT, was successful in persuading Canadian company Baird Associates to renew direct industry funding of our collaboration by setting up a PhD in Ottawa to run in parallel with a newly funded EPSRC PhD project in our group (Mr Luis via Estrem) to further develop and use the new software tools at Imperial - See key findings</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9FC1767E-D502-4DE5-B564-E0AC86ECB746</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Software for complex shape packing was developed</gtr:description><gtr:id>1D653B97-78CD-4B79-9C08-965149619C1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The licensing terms have been agreed with Imperial Innovations</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:protection>Copyrighted (e.g. software)</gtr:protection><gtr:title>DEMPlus</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>VGW, Version 1.0 (now named VGeST - Virtual Geoscience Simulation Tools)

Its wider use is somewhat challenged by the CPU demands which mean interesting real world and industry problems are often held back by impractically long run times, so a focus on parallelisation has resulted.

The numerical simulation technology (based on the combined finite-discrete element method, FEMDEM) developed in this project is unique in that it can simulate multi-body interactions and deformation of any complex shaped bodies or particles. The effort has focused on creating numerical models of breakwater armour layers that have the complex friction and interlocking behaviour of real Gigantic (10-100 tonne armour unit) Granular Systems on breakwaters. 
Depending on the density of the packing and the shape of the units and the underlayer roughness, the granular layer systems perform differently to the same energy disturbances. 
Two methods of disturbing the layers have been tested. Vibration - like an earthquake disturbance - shows very clearly the different degree of stability of the different designs of armouring the breakwater. However, a more promising method is the 'Wave Proxy' method that uses FEMDEM to combine oscillatory drag, buoyancy and lift forces (oscillations associated with an idealised storm wave action) with the contact and body forces of the solid skeleton.
The heterogeneity and statistical nature of contact forces and internal stresses as well as movements have all been demonstrated in this research by simulating the dynamic response of granular structures. The structures are built and begin with a realistic pseudo-random orientation and quite regular spatial distribution of placed units. If not initially tightly packed, the units can be seen to spead out and form gaps just above the still water line and compact by settlement further downslope.
The GGS project is set ready for a phase with increasing engineering insights, e.g. into how to design better units and armouring systems, now that the software has been parallelised and can execute faster runs. 

Updated March 2016:
The Wave Proxy approach indeed proved more than promising. 
A follow-up grant (Numerical Breakwater Wave Proxy Tool - NBWPT) funded by EPSRC for one year PtI (Pathway to Impact Acceleration Account managed by Imperial College London) led to a new methodology that combined wave forces in a design storm with the forces controlling the solid interactions. This was presented in Boston at the Intl Conf on Coastal Structures in Sept 2015 and journal papers are in preparation. Of most interest for Coastal companies: Artelia, Baird and CH2MHill, was the hydraulic force history and solids modelling behind the impressive ability to see a movie simulation of the wave by wave movements and velocity vectors for every armour unit out of a 242 unit model section of a breakwater, where the contact forces on each unit can be investigated and concrete breakages predicted. 
Long-term funders - Consulting Engineering Company, Baird and Associates have just begun a PhD study Jan 2016, with Ottawa University specifically to perform Hydraulics Laboratory Experiments needed to validate the powerful software tools for modelling breakwaters generated in the GGS project and its NBWPT follow-up. Furthermore, a new Imperial College PhD studentship project funded by EPSRC, to examine use of our new software for designing resilient breakwaters, will run in parallel with the experiments at Ottawa, and will be conducted in AMCG group, to start in September 2016. 
It should be noted that many generic tools developed in this project led to the fast parallelised shape packing technologies that are applicable to a wide range of industrial processes and are under exploitation arrangements with Imperial Innovations who will be licencing the DEMPlus software on behalf of the inventors at Imperial.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The code developments are largely generic. The recently parallelised (faster execution) code and Wave Proxy modelling improved implementations has made this technology very attractive to engineers. As a result, Pathway to Impact follow-up funding was secured from EPSRC. A post-doctoral expert from IH-Cantabria joined Imperial's group in 2015. He calibrated the Wave Proxy Model for design storm waves and shared its impact widely with Coastal Engineers in a specially convened workshop. The large strain plasticity and 3D fracture model developments (this fracture model part was funded independently) make the unique properties of this code of extreme interest to concrete armour unit designers and also manufacturing companies working with particulates - chemical engineers, pharmaceutical companies.
Johnson Matthey Catalysts have funded a CASE EPSRC studentship to model the fragile packed bed system of hollow cylindrical catalyst pellets, using this advanced multi-body software. The simulation methods can be applied to rock-fill and soil materials and to avalanche and rock-fall problems. The possible exploitation by JM is in an advanced state and reaching a final decision in March 2017.

As the project at Imperial is hosted within a group AMCG of computational scientists (55 persons; 30 professionals + 25 PhDs), there are many developments that are currently being funded that involve coupling the solid modelling technologies further developed in this GGS project with advanced multiphase fluids models. These technologies have potential to impact widely in reservoir engineering, hydraulic fracturing, water jet drilling, waste repository safety, rock blasting, rock avalanching into water bodies and many more fields.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>048C9653-48DE-4ACF-BD21-285A42671CD8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://solidityproject.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The model captures the movement of armour units in a breakwater.
