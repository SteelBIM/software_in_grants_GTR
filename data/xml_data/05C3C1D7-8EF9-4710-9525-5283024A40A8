Specific beneficiaries include finance directors, auditors and other firm officials responsible for corporate financial reporting and communication, investors in corporate securities and their advisors, financial regulators (The Financial Services Authority, the Dept BIS), and accounting policy makers (e.g., FRC, ASB,EFRAG and the International Accounting Standards Board). 

For corporate users, the research will provide insights into the efficacy of alternative accounting and disclosure choices for firms' financial communications. How firms manage their reporting reputation through disclosure policy and accounting choices, and the extent to which reporting reputation affects the cost of capital and/or liquidity will be of particular interest to this group. 

The project will also benefit users of corporate financial information. It will provide new evidence on the quality and reliability of firms' disclosure and accounting choices, and the factors that cause the quality of these two dimensions to vary across firms and over time. We will provide systematic evidence on how to read corporate disclosures, and how to identify disclosures that are more or less likely to be informative. Users will also have access to our online tools for the textual analysis of annual reports, other firm disclosures such as interim management statements, and financial media reports. 

For accounting and finance regulators, we hope to show how a regulatory approach that co-ordinates policy across disclosure regulation and accounting standards can lead to superior outcomes than regulating these issues separately. We will aim to contribute to early policy thinking about the creation of a UK financial reporting laboratory (FRC 2011), and to two current projects of EFRAG (see enclosed letter of support).

Our dissemination plan includes a wide range of communication and engagement activities designed to inform academic and professional communities, the financial media, and policy makers. We will adopt a portfolio approach to promote user engagement and maximise research impact, including professionally-oriented publications, media coverage, seminars, presentations, and a project-specific website. We will target the research papers of the project at leading international journals, building on the team's strong track record of international peer reviewed publications.
 
We will organise two conferences to present the project work, and we will contribute to other events managed by the ICAEW. In 2012 the PI will give the P. D. Leake Lecture that will draw on themes developed in the project. A London conference, to be held at the ICAEW, will target academics, professionals and policy makers, and serve as a platform for communicating the project's objectives and discussing issues related to our research agenda. The Manchester capstone conference will present outputs to a similar audience. 

The project will be part sponsored by the ICAEW, whom we will work with to ensure the work is widely distributed. We will produce an ICAEW research 'Briefing' that explains the implications of the research in a form that is accessible to accounting and finance professionals. We will also produce articles for a variety of well known user publications and financial media such as Accountancy, the Investors Chronicle, the Financial Times and the Economist. The academic partners' press offices and the ICAEW's media relations team have extensive experience of dissemination activities to non-academic audiences and we will utilise their experience and skills throughout the course of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>281674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Mind your language' on Global banking and finance review</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4AAB1A3-9764-4EF2-BEEE-1DD22AA797CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased awareness of the project and findings.

Creation of a publicly available web tool to permit large batch scoring of UK annual report narratives. Details of the web tool are available at: https://cfie.lancaster.ac.uk:8443/. Key features of the tool include its use of novel hybrid text analysis methods to detect UK annual report structure, count word frequencies, calculate readability and other quality metrics to score individual sections of the annual report such as strategy, performance, governance and remuneration. It also carefully distinguishes between the front end narratives, and the mandatory financial statements and notes. The tool links with the WMatrix corpus tool for further comparative language analysis (http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/wmatrix/). The tool has been used by the team to score the linguistic characteristics of the narratives in over 10,000 UK annual reports, spanning the period 2003 to 2013. These scores and reference corpus profiles are also being made publicly available. Paper (A1) outlines the computing methods we have used.

B. Large scale analysis of the cross-sectional variation, and variation over time in annual report narratives across several dimensions (B1). The first large scale analysis of the link between narrative disclosure and UK firm performance (B2). The first detailed empirical analysis of the development of disclosures relating to the business strategies of UK firms in their annual report narratives (B3). The first comprehensive index of narrative disclosure quality for a very large panel of UK listed companies and its relation to time series and cross section variation in the cost of equity capital (B4). New findings on the determinants and capital market effects of UK annual reporting quality (B5).

C. Significant progress on understanding and analysing the content and impact of other corporate disclosures relating to the financial performance of UK firms, including Interim Management Statements (C1), and Preliminary Earnings Announcements (PEAs). This body of work includes findings from interviewing key capital market stakeholders for their views on the relative timeliness of PEAs and Annual Report narratives, and the usefulness of Interim Management Statements (C2). The first paper comparing manual and computer-based content analysis of linguistic tonal and attribution bias in UK PEAs (C3).

D. Significant new research on understanding the causes and consequences of the quality of the corporate financial information environment. This includes: work on the interaction between investors' perceived credibility of forward-looking disclosures and earnings quality (D1); original work on earnings quality and earnings management for both US and UK firms ((D2) and (D3)); work on the interaction between company press releases and financial media articles in the USA (D4); and the creation of a novel, stock returns based, measure of asymmetry in the flow of good news versus bad news that is complementary to other measures of disclosure quality (D5). New work reviewing the policy relevance of research on accounting conservatism (D6).

Conferences in 2013 and 2014 brought together leading practitioners and international researchers to shape the &amp;quot;narratives&amp;quot; research agenda. Details of the conferences, published outputs and working papers are available on the project web-site at http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/cfie/. Individual items are coded (A1) to (D6) as above.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academics globally are very interested in large scale analyses of why narrative disclosure quality varies across firms, and why disclosure quality evolves over time. We have made such large scale research possible for economies outside the US where the annual report is the main vehicle for corporate narrative disclosures.
We are aware that Financial Reporting policy makers such as DBIS and the FRC are currently especially interested in how Annual narrative reporting practices are evolving, and we expect both the new data we have generated and the web tool we have produced to be used by one or more of these parties in the near future. 
 The work will also be of interest to investor relations, major accounting firms and other financial reporting specialists interested in bench-marking the practices of firms against each other. Individual companies are interested in comparing their own practices with the practices of other firms.
 Investment analysts are also interested in how firms compare, and if there is anything unusual about one of the firms hey are following.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8ECBB3E3-7ADD-4779-BA65-A0F1589C407A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>In the CFIE project we analysed more than 10,000 annual reports.
