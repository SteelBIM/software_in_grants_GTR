It aims to investigate the strategies and processes through which the police service in England and Wales communicates into the public sphere; it will examine police interaction with media organisations and will explore how people receive and make sense of mediated information about the police. To achieve this, a range of methods will be utilised, including:&lt;/p> 
&lt;ul> 
 &lt;li>undertaking a questionnaire survey of police organisations;&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>interviewing police policymakers and practitioners;&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>interviewing media professionals (primarily, but not exclusively, news-media personnel); and&lt;/li> 
 &lt;li>conducting group discussions with local people in contrasting sites within one police force area.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul> 
&lt;p>Using these methods, the intention is to bring together the three elements of police, media and audience into one integrated study that maps the national context of police-media relations and then examines the communications dynamics at a local level. The study aims to make a timely and practical contribution to current knowledge of police communications in relation to the accountability and perceived effectiveness of public sector organisations. On a theoretical level, it will explore the role that police-media relations plays in maintaining police legitimacy during times of rapid technological and organisational change.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>My research was used by the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press.

? The focus group research suggested that people have complex attitudes towards policing. Goodwill towards the police and their role coexists with awareness of organisational issues and limited expectations. Perceptions are formed through a variety of sources, principally through families, friends and people's own backgrounds and experiences. People have a high awareness of policing in the media and have realistic perceptions of the differences between media representations and actual policing. 



? Corporate communications is an increasingly significant area of policing business that has grown in scope over the last ten years. This has not been an entirely smooth progression; the growth has been matched by demand for services and departments have been under financial pressure. Communications is not consistently 'built-in' to police business across forces; the professionalising trajectory is embedded to varying degrees in different forces. 



? The state of police-media relations remains in healthy tension. Although journalists, particularly local newspaper reporters, operate within financial constraints and in an increasingly competitive media world, they continue to hold the police to account. They use the increasingly professional police communications services, but do not depend on them and maintain their own police contacts. Both parties value the relationship and recognise that there will be periodic conflict. This is healthy for accountable policing. 



? Journalists have a wary suspicion of the professionalization of police communications; awareness exists of its potential to control media relations and to make policing less transparent. However, the same professionalising developments have the potential to support accountable policing. In this respect, police communications managers are facilitating direct communication with local communities. Neighbourhood Policing is an appropriate vehicle for this.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Using the project's data and findings in a non-academic context was an essential part of the research and there are indications that the research has been of interest to policing stakeholders and policymakers, including: 



? The award holder was the only criminologist summoned to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry in April 2012. 



? The award holder was invited to discuss the findings of the research relating to communications and public confidence with the Cabinet Office 'Crime and Communities' Review Team headed by Louise Casey in May 2008.



? The award holder was invited to act as academic advisor to South Yorkshire Police Authority's Corporate Communications Review Team in May 2007.



? Positive feedback from police forces following dissemination of a summary report to all police forces.



? Requests from police forces for further data analysis following dissemination of the report.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>64571108-0511-4546-8DF8-04B9B9BFD3DD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The Leveson Inquiry</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19720A29-ECB5-49AD-BFCC-50E49152AE96</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140122145147/http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc07/0780/0780.asp</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/031DD043-24F9-4518-A3B2-32110716CC88"><gtr:id>031DD043-24F9-4518-A3B2-32110716CC88</gtr:id><gtr:title>Police corporate communications, crime reporting and the shaping of policing news</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Policing and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ad59a9031cac2d1f1be257207dc2065a"><gtr:id>ad59a9031cac2d1f1be257207dc2065a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mawby R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0BDE89DE-CA8B-4A1A-8287-5A728932F1A5"><gtr:id>0BDE89DE-CA8B-4A1A-8287-5A728932F1A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Crisis?
