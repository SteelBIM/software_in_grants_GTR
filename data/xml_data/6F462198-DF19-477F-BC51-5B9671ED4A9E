University</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L013827/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>For many years there has been a gap in the resolution of Confocal Laser Scanning Microsopy and even with perfect lenses, optimal alignment, and large numerical apertures the optical resolution of this form of light microscopy has been limited to approximately half of the wavelength of the light used meaning that only cellular structures and objects at least 200 to 350 nm apart could be resolved as distinct separate structures. However, much of the fundamental biology of the cell, occurs at the level of micro-molecular complexes in the size range of tens to few hundred nm, i.e., beyond the reach of conventional light microscopy. Super resolution microscopes (SRM) have been developed to break or bypass the classical diffraction limits and shift the optical resolution down to macro-molecular or even molecular levels. It can locate single molecules down to 20nm precision. SRM can also provide particle tracking to follow single molecules, e.g. proteins, DNA, drugs, in a sample without compromising resolution. 
Although the University of Nottingham (UoN) houses a range of microscopy facilities there is a clear gap in resolution that requires the cutting edge technology SRM provides to take the research into areas that are not currently achievable in Nottingham Life Sciences at present. Some of these areas include: (i) Microbiology: to understand better how bacterial cells interact with each other and how they can transfer molecules and signals within and between cells in bacterial communities known as biofilms; (ii) Bioenergy: to understand how some bacterial cellular energy reservoirs are transformed into biofuels and hence be able to optimize of these processes; (iii) Synthetic Biology: to understand how artificial cells and specialized DNA structures are developed as this can have a significant impact within different industrial contexts; (iv) Stem cell biology and tissue engineering: the SRM will have a significant impact on understanding the development of specialized cells from stem cells and the development of tissue scaffolds which will be paramount in regenerative medicine required for the repair of different damaged human tissues; (v) Plant sciences: to understand some of the signaling processes in root development and the mechanisms of pollen development which impact on crop production and sustainable agriculture; (vi) Food security: to unravel essential mechanisms of interaction between pathogens and host cells of farm animals which are responsible for significant loses in the farm industry with the ultimate aim of targeting some of these to reduce the negative economic impact they have and (vii) Molecular pharmacology: to facilitate the understanding of drug-target interactions enabling their optimization with the consequent improvements to health.
Hence the acquisition of a SRM facility will enable UoN to address key biological questions in the above areas which will have a significant impact on science, the economy and society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The objective of this grant application is to provide the University of Nottingham with a Super Resolution Microscopy Unit in a Class 2 containment facility which can be used for both Class 1 and Class 2 experiments. The SR microscope will combine super resolution structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) and single molecule localisation techniques (PALM &amp;amp; dSTORM) to enable the localization of single molecules with precision down to 20 nm. Using this technology, an optical grid leading to a large number of images (e.g. 10,000) with very low levels of blinking fluorescence can be collected from single molecules by localising the dots in each of the 10,000 images. Because of the large number of acquired images required for the localisation data, samples in general need to be fixed unless lower localization precision is required. It will also provide particle tracking to follow single molecules in a sample without compromising resolution. Amongst the applications will be the ability to track single molecules (proteins, DNA, drugs etc). This microscope will be combined with a sophisticated confocal microscope with a 32-channel GaAsP detector for better quantum efficiency to improve the detection of weak signals and signal-to-noise ratio and which also enables the observation of molecules at high resolution in real time and the potential to image the same cell with SRM after fixation. This combination is essential for the acquisition of the molecular details of e.g. protein transport mechanisms, bacterial and viral proteins interacting with eukaryotic molecules, localization of small molecules in plant cells, biofilm architecture, tracking molecules in stem cell biology, DNA oregami structures, bacterial communication within biofilms, the activation of multiple nanosensors in specific areas of a bacterial biofilm and in tissue scaffolds etc.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The RCUK have identified an urgent need to invest in imaging technology through the RCUK Strategic Framework for Capital Investment. The establishment of next generation microscopy platforms are key to answering questions involving the multi-disciplinary research that underpins biology that utilises cutting-edge light microscopy and dynamic cell imaging. In this context the Super Resolution Microscope (SRM) facility will provide a unique dimension to the microscopy facilities at the University of Nottingham (UoN). Due to the multidisciplinarity of the research areas for which the SRM unit will be used, the main objective for this facility will be to impact on research, researchers and industry from the following disciplines:
-Microbiology: the research proposed will have a significant impact in a wide range of industrial sectors where biofilms have either positive or detrimental effects.
-Bioenergy Industry: it will enable a better understanding of how cellulosomes are transformed into biofuels resulting in the optimization of these processes and how to reduce product toxicity. 
-Synthetic Biology: the applications proposed will have an impact on the development of artificial cells and DNA nanostructures relevant to different industrial contexts.
-Stem cell biology and tissue engineering: the SRM will have a significant impact on understanding the development of specialized cells from stem cells and the development of tissue scaffolds which will be paramount in regenerative medicine
-Plant sciences: the proposed research will be important to understand signaling processes in root development and the mechanisms of pollen development which impact on crop production and sustainable agriculture.
-Food security: the SRM will be used to unravel essential mechanisms of interaction between pathogens and host cells from farm animals which are responsible for significant losses in the farm industry with the ultimate aim of targeting these and reduce their negative economic impact.
-Molecular pharmacology: the use of SRM will facilitate the understanding of drug-target interactions enabling their optimization with the subsequent impact on patients suffering so contributing to health.
The SRM facility will also have an impact on:
a. Researchers: Through the acquisition of formalized training on the use of the SRM facility. These will include not only researchers at UoN but also visitors from Nottingham collaborators needing to use SRM.
b. The University of Nottingham: It will support the advancement of current research areas and the development of new research possibilities. Having a SRM will attract new collaborations to Nottingham, especially in areas where the current microscopy facilities do not provide the appropriate level of resolution
c. The Midlands: as it will enable researchers from this region, especially those collaborating with the UoN to have access to a local SRM facility and associated expertise. 
d. The international relationships between UoN and researchers outside the UK through collaborations between Nottingham researchers and the international research community and industrial companies.
The wider public will also benefit in the longer term from the research conducted at the SRM facility through the increased ability of different industrial sectors to respond to their customer needs from the environment, to agriculture and health.
The research achievements from the SRM facility will be communicated to a range of audiences via presentations through to discussions and workshops with industry contacts, publications in journals targeting a wide range of audiences and conferences and a dedicated website. The research from the SRM facility and its potential will also be communicated to the general public through the yearly University of Nottingham May Fest and through the 'Nottingham Potential' outreach activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>735267</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A selection of super resolution images have been printed and mounted on the corridors of the University.

Detection of single molecule signals enable localisation and image reconstruction of nanoscale fluorescent objects of 100 nm. The nanoscale features, nanobeads, are modified with photoswitchable dyes, like spiropyran. They can be resolved via photo-activated localization microscopy (PALM) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) techniques in super-resolution microscopy due to their optical properties. The device can be easily manufactured at low cost and re-used over time for more than one experiment. The entire worldwide microscopy community using super-resolution microscopy could use such a sample in their laboratory to improve the calibration of their microscopes. The prototype will be finailsed in 2017. An Intellectual Property Review Form has been filed with the University of Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9CD4BF7-D79A-4C77-8458-98DF1986AEAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At first glance the companies that could be interested in such technology would be companies that develop and work on the generation of new super resolution microscopes like Zeiss, Leica, Olympus or Nikon. Authors already have a contact in Zeiss that would be interested in testing the new samples.

Beside, every laboratory in academia having a super resolution microscope could be interested in testing \ having such a sample.Authors have contacts over the country, research officers and academics, who would be happy to test the sample.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:protection>Protection not required</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Nanoscale calibration samples for super-resolution microscopy &amp;amp; Nanoscale photoactivatable particles for localisation and tracking of molecules of interest</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a number of techniques which are enabling us to visualise biological process which could not be resolved in such a high definition.
Using the Super Resolution Microscopy Facility researchers at Nottingham we have:
1. Design tracer molecules which bind to the surface of the human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. The density and the surface localisation of the tracer molecules have been validated using super resolution microscopy. This pathogen relies upon surface expressed proteins to help initiate infection. Super resolution microscopy will help to investigate these proteins at 10 times more resolution than before enabling us to gain a better understanding of the infections caused by this bacterium (Phill Hill).

2.Localised proteins in E. coli involved in disease. We have constructed a three dimensional super resolution model which has enabled us to measure the mobility these proteins inside the bacterial cell using super resolution microscopy alongside in situ ?uorescent labelling of individual molecules. We have been able to visualize and precisely localise structures within the bacterial cell with minimal or no disturbance of those structures (Kim Hardie).

3. Demonstrated the binding of peptides to bacterial DNA using multicolour single molecule imaging and super resolution microscopy. We have found that this interaction results in changes in the virulence of the bacterial pathogens. (Jafar Mahdavi)

4.Generated high resolution three dimensional models to study the distribution of lipids in the microalgae (C. reinhardtii) used as functional food and feed. The super resolution methodology applied is suitable to assess lipid production in algae and to assess the efficiency of the extraction of these lipids (David Gray).

5. Localised nanoparticles after treatment. These experiments show the efficiency of various drug delivery strategies. With super resolution microscopy were able to visualise and measure fluorescent nanoparticles inside different cell lineages (Virginie Sottile, Phil Williams)

6. Developed a nano calibration sample for super resolution microscopy. This sample is aimed to serve as a standard to compare various super resolution microscopy systems. The prototype samples will be sent out to other UK based imaging facilities (Robert Markus and Leo Marques)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be applicable to researchers working in protein localisation, antimicrobials, drug delivery, lipid localisation and more general in super resolution microscopy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>69EA69BD-B773-411F-AF4F-92062FCA905D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have implemented an image storage and sharing interface, where microscope users store their imaging data.
