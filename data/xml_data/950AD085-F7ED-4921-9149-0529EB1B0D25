&lt;p>The new study for 2015, led by a team from the Universities of Manchester, Oxford and Nottingham, will focus on issues of representation and accountability, growing disengagement with mainstream political choices, and the impact of economic hardships and austerity upon political attitudes and participation. Themed 'Voters in Context', the study has been designed to aid understanding of how the changing political, economic and social context impact on British electoral behaviour. It will include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>a high quality address-based random probability sample face-to-face post-election survey&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>an inter-election internet panel across eight waves, including a daily rolling thunder campaign study of voters during the election campaign&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a 'Comparative Study of Electoral Systems? module in the post-election survey. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Innovations include the harvesting of twitter data in the campaign, the use of interactive technologies to map the personal social contexts of respondents, and the use of experimental methodology to enable comparison across the BES series. The study will develop an integrated data infrastructure for the study of elections through a program of data linkage and training.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The BES constitutes a key research resource for a wide range of users beyond academia. The data and associated scholarship serve an important role in understanding the electoral process and the health of democracy. This will be particularly relevant in 2015, due to declining political engagement, the implications of multi-party and multi-level governance for accountability, and of economic austerity for political representation. 
Beneficiaries: Politicians and parties benefit from understanding the consequences of their policy positions and campaigns, public attitudes towards politics and reasons for vote choice and voter turnout. BES data is beneficial to political actors in Scottish and Welsh government, local government, European parliament elections, mayoral government, and to independence referendum campaigners in Scotland. BES data has international value in our proposal by enabling comparison with other countries, benefiting international observers, comparative researchers and politicians. Journalists and commentators benefit from non-partisan analysis and interpretation, and from a high-quality data source; enhancing public understanding via informed commentary. To the extent that effective policy is informed by understanding public preferences and priorities, national, regional and local government policy-makers derive benefits from the understanding of public attitudes. Policy benefits are direct on political reform and on voter registration methods. Beneficiaries also include think tanks, trade unions, commercial and third-sector organisations. Think-tanks and trade unions benefit from understanding public attitudes and political consequences. Commercial pollsters benefit from insights on question design and subsequent analysis, and from scientific capacity-building in the academic analysis of public opinion. Social media and e-government specialists will benefit from insights into social media trends and effects. Further benefits will accrue to third-sector organisations such as the Electoral Commission and the Hansard Society. The specified organisations will benefit from closely linked BES questionnaire priorities, from research into electoral registration and into political disengagement, accountability and representation, and from shared research goals, and dissemination activities. 
Potential Impacts: The proposed study maximizes opportunities for impact during the four-years of the study, and is expected to achieve impact in subsequent years and elections, as policy-makers respond to the data and the research, and politicians implement changes in strategy. BES data accessibility - to any user - will ensure the longevity of potential impacts. Our partnership with the Electoral Commission is specifically intended to inform decision-making on voter registration, to understand the effect of a new method of voter registration on national and local turnout, and in turn to inform local authorities on voter registration and turnout. The election study spans a crucial period in this policy area, and is ideally suited for this impact partnership. Our partnership with the Hansard Society will inform the Society's planned focus on representation, to guide politicians and policy on civic attitudes to politics, in partnership with the Society's annual 'Audit of Political Engagement', and to inform public understanding of these issues. Impacts on national and devolved political party strategies and on policy-making will be maximized via the study design and via a series of events (see Pathways to Impact), and impact on media reporting - and on public understanding of politics and of the relevant elections - will be on going. The collection of election data contributes, ultimately, to the nation's wellbeing. This depends, at least in part, upon the relationship between the electorate and its political elites and on the quality of political representation; which the BES is uniquely able to assess.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2347163</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;A social model of turnout&quot; Mannheim Centre for European Social Research,</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80177E20-E760-4CD0-85C9-BC3C7C608122</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;A social model of turnout&amp;quot; Mannheim Centre for European Social Research, May 19th 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Radio 4 'More or Less' programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A572FE8-006B-4BC8-929D-CE3D94D4DD77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC Radio 4 'More or Less' Programme January 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Local Elections 2016: how to judge what Labours resukts will mean for the party</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA7A6FCD-F210-41C1-BEDE-68578071F64A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article printed in the Guardian Newspaper may 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding the General Election: Q&amp;A.

Few could have anticipated the surge in support for Jeremy Corbyn, who after getting on to the Labour leadership ballot by the skin of his teeth has become remarkably popular among his party's grassroots. Most Labour supporters have something to say on the Corbyn phenomenon, and opinions range from doom-laden scenarios to a welcome break from the New Labour past. Former PM Tony Blair, unsurprisingly, speaks for the former.

One of the bitterest arguments between the two Labour sides has been over how the nation sees the party in terms of its place in the left-right spectrum. Fellow leadership contender Liz Kendal echoes Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson by arguing that Labour's election loss could be explained by its leftward drift under Ed Miliband. But Corbyn and his supporters say the nation turned away from Labour for precisely the opposite reason: it was too obsessed with the political centre ground.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>political science presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D02B1C9C-26AC-461C-949D-E93FCF8D754A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science, Nov 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'The British Electorate in 2015: The fragmentation of Britain's Party system'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E423524-7D54-48A2-869A-A1C6872AE9B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'The British Electorate in 2015: The fragmentation of Britain's Party system'

Evidence from the British Election Study shows there is little evidence to back Harriet Harman's claim that women are less likely to vote than men.

Dr Rosie Campbell, a political scientist from Birkbeck University of London, says numbers of 'missing women voters' highlighted by Labour are almost identical to the numbers of missing men.

The inaccuracy in the statistics, announced as part of the launch of last week's magenta battle bus intended to reach out to women voters, was probably down to a methodical flaw in the calculations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with Dutch Radio (NOS-3)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1FBBAE83-81D9-4ABF-8A7D-4EB059202B0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview with Dutch Radio (NOS-3) about General Elections 8 May 2015 by Cees van der Eijk</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to MSc students - Survey Research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2C0FD1E-3402-4017-A9E8-F4D1A7746A87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to 30 MSc Students in Social Research Methods and Statistics in their module Survey Research on the survey design on the BES Internet Panel Survey - Kathryn Simpson

New research from the British Election Study reveals that last year's Scottish referendum effectively finished off Labour's hope of winning north of the border last May.

BES Co-Director Professor Ed Fieldhouse from The University of Manchester says the referendum resulted in more Yes voters switching from Labour to the SNP after the referendum.

However, the economy was still an important factor: Yes voting amongst Labour voters was driven largely by the Yes campaign's offer of an economic alternative for Scotland.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Conference of the Elections, Public Opinion and Parties (EPOP) University of Kent</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D6890928-B6E3-49C7-B2D6-162B64767E62</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Annual Conference of the Elections, Public Opinion and Parties (EPOP) University of Kent : The collapse of Constraint: party identity and voter volatility, 1964-2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Independent Newspaper</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>22DC067E-4161-4291-84EF-FBE48F9730B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Britain, a nation of swing voters as age of tribal politics comes to an end - The Independent Newspaper</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poll Battle Poised to Define War with UKIP</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>56E2A3CD-ADC4-4853-B86F-5C2E6C1ADAF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Rob Ford featured in Financial Times article Poll Battle Poised to Define War with UKIP - October 2014

New research from the British Election Study has revealed that contrary to the popular view, Ukip is no more successful at winning over the politically disengaged than the other parties.

New research from the British Election Study has suggested a reason why pollsters so famously got the 2015 General Election result wrong.

BES researchers Dr Jon Mellon and Chris Prosser say the data from the online BES survey of 30,000 people conducted after the election strongly show that many respondents said they intended to vote but then did not.

And the mistaken respondents, they say, lean significantly more to Labour than to other respondents, increasing significantly after 2010.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Breakfast News - July 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C624CC0-68A9-48D7-8B4F-FDD68E559516</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publicised BES findings on BBC Breakfast News July 2014

Ukip will inflict much more damage on the Conservative Party in the 2015 General Election than on Labour, according to new research from the British Election Study.

Professor Geoff Evans, from The University of Oxford (Nuffield College) and a Co-Director of the BES, says many of Labour's core supporters had already deserted their party between 2001 and 2010 as a reaction to Tony Blair and New Labour and have since moved to UKIP.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release : Ukip decline will hit Labour's chances</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>177F774A-62BD-466D-A426-7EA5D8B97BE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>First few paragraphs of the press release : 

A marked decline in the electoral fortunes of Ukip would hit Labour's chances of forming a majority in May, according to new research from the British Election Study.

Dr Jon Mellon, a BES Research Fellow from The University of Oxford, says BES data provides some backing to David Cameron's claim that if voters get into bed with Nigel Farage they could wake up with David Miliband.

According to his calculations, 41% of Ukip voters would choose the Conservatives as their second preference, compared to just 19% for Labour.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3E96574-1C90-4C40-8506-1D7C66649339</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Midwest Political Science Association (MPSA) 2015 Shared partnership and the Impact of Social Norms on Voter Turnout</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ITV EU Referendum Special Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>234CCAF3-5627-4A6F-86BC-A860AAB52AF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ITV EU Referendum Special Programme (one of two experts for over-night programme), June 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBC Radio Cumbria - Tory Party Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F484D65-8B14-45DD-A26E-B6BD1EB85C09</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Regional interview in relation to Tory Party Conference on BBC Radio Cumbria - 2 October 2014

For example, Jane Green and Chris Prosser were the only academics asked to contribute to Labour's 'Learning the Lessons' review, chaired by Margaret Beckett. The BES, described as the UK's leading authority on elections, provided material central to the review, which constitutes a key part of Labour's response to defeat. The BES has been a major part of the Market Research Society and British Polling Council commissioned Inquiry into the 2015 Polls. The face-to-face BES data were the first to demonstrate that unrepresentative samples were the cause of the polling misses. The BES forms a major contribution to understanding and finding solutions for the miss, with Jane Green as a member of the inquiry and Jon Mellon and Chris Prosser's analysis of BES data being highly influential. The BES appeared almost daily in the TV, radio, social and print media around election time, the most prominent example being ITV's election night coverage which featured Jane Green who provided exclusive insights from BES data released and reported on the night. BES data was also used on Vote 2014, the BBC's coverage of the local elections, with David Dimbleby.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8CA7CC2A-B191-4AD6-87B6-CAD8A5A5895B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>emergent party, provides the key to understanding UKIP's popularity. A combination of weak partisanship and the 2004 decision on open immigration from EU Accession countries crystallized a potent new dimension of politics. UKIP rise is more powerfully accounted for by political decisions than long-term dealignment, but, as with Brexit, both had a part to play. 
 3. The Scottish Independence referendum cost Labour a huge amount of support with pro-independence voters driven to voting for the SNP. This arose from changes in attitudes, evaluations and political identities of 'Yes' voters before, but more importantly after, the Scottish referendum. There is also evidnece that there has been a potentially lasting shit in party identification in Scotland as a result of the referendum

5. The economy played a very important role in the outcome of the 2015 British general election. Had the economic upturn not occurred prior to 2015, it is possible that the Conservatives would not have formed a majority and the votes to minor parties in 2015 would have been even greater, resulting in even greater fragmentation to the British party system in 2015. The classic reward-punishment economic voting model worked in 2015, and it extended from a choice between Labour and the Conservatives to a choice - for prior Conservative or UKIP voters - to one between UKIP and the Conservatives. However, this was only part of the story. The outcome of the election and Labour's poor performance is also explained by the economic crash of 2008, and that voters still held Labour responsible for the UK debt. This suggests that understanding both the short-term economic vote and the long-term economic context are crucial for understanding election outcomes. 

6. The collapse of the Liberal Democrats is mainly attributable to the decision to go into coalition with the Conservatives alienating their support base on the centre-left of British politics. Following coalition voters became more negative about the Liberal Democrats if they were more left wing and unhappy about spending cuts. At the same time many of their more right leaning supporters deserted to the Conservatives who were given more credit for positive coalition outcomes. The Lib Dems were especially vulnerable because of their weak partisan base and their reliance on tactical support. 

7. The multilevel nature of governance in the UK means that voters now have more opportunities to support different parties in different electoral contexts. We show that voting in the European Parliament Elections run under a more proportional voting system gave voters the opportunity to express support for challenger parties. Those that did so became more likely to vote for those parties in the subsequent general election, thus contributing to fragmentation. Like non-voters, challenger party voters were more likely to be disaffected by politics and indifferent about the choice offered by established parties. However they appealed to different sections of the population to non-voters, and mainly to those who had previously voted for major parties. Voting for challenger parties were also boosted by expectations of a hung parliament. 

 The BES also conducted parallel vote validation exercises and asked comparable questions on its face-to-face panel probability sample survey and its internet panel. This made it uniquely placed to understand the 'polling miss' of 2015. Our research shows that the primary reason why the polls went wrong before the election is because they were drawn from unrepresentative samples, in particular under-sampling non-voters. In contrast there is little evidence of systematic vote intention misreporting, late swing, systematically different preferences among &amp;quot;don't knows&amp;quot; or differential turnout of parties' supporters.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our data are being widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we are putting into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage.

Waves 1-3 cover the Scottish Referendum as well as providing crucial pre-General election data across the whole of Great Britain. Waves 4-6 cover the pre-campaign period, the short campaign and post-election phases of the 2015 General Election. Wave 7-9 cover the pre/campaign and post-EU Referendum Period. The study covers electors who are eligible to vote to vote in any type of UK election (including local and European). The file contains all respondents who took any wave of the study. Around 30,000 respondents were interviewed in each wave (referred to as the full sample). We also release single Waves as standalone files for users who do not require the panel element. The most recent wave to be released (wave 9) was conducted by YouGov between 4th June 2016 and 4th July 2016. In total 30,036 respondents took wave 9, 27,555 of these also took wave 8, an overall wave on wave retention rate of 82.2%. 10,170 respondents took all of the first 9 waves of the survey, 33.6% of respondents who originally took wave 1.</gtr:description><gtr:id>56AD84A8-7C59-4516-950B-63EC134E5ED2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our data are being widely used by academics, media and political researchers to understand developments in British Politics, and we are putting into place a number of measures to widen access and promote usage.
