Over subsequent decades, a range of technical constraints led to concerted scientific endeavour to overcome obstacles in the sending of messages electronically. This project draws on discussions of twenty-first century digital culture and its limit points to establish why it is that the scrambling of messages was as significant for Victorian culture at large as the sending of flawless messages. It is our hypothesis that pleasures and excitements produced by the new technology were productive of new cultural forms in literary writing and fine art. These cultural forms adopt at one and the same time the emotional repertoire proper to heedless, abstract technophilia and that associated with an uneasy recognition of recalcitrant materiality.

The enquiry will move between material objects and conceptual ideas. We will ask what were the particular practices and sensations generated by telegraphic communication. We will ask what was the range of British public commentary and graphic imagery produced in response to the drama and developing technology associated with the telegraph. A doctoral study on Victorian illustration and graphic reportage (embedded in the research project) will lend a specific dimension to our engagement with issues of news, and information. A second embedded doctoral study on the short story will address general questions of abbreviation and seriality. In addition to the public commentary on science and communications technology the project will work with scientific papers, the principles and forms of the instruments used for telegraphy and the scientific investigations that drove telegraphy. The project will transform the cataloguing and web presentation of the Wheatstone Collection of scientific papers and instruments held by KCL. Wheatstone (1802-1875) was a pioneer in the technologies of the telegraph. We will consider apparatus and instruments such as the induction relay, galvanometers, voltaic batteries and telegraph transmitters and receivers, and indeed the armoured cable itself in terms of their functions and materials. We will draw on archival materials associated with the development of the telegraph. The problems exercising inventors and technicians will offer us sets of opposing terms with which to look into Victorian culture such as proximity/distance and conductivity/impedence.

We will ask whether the artistic form itself is subject to some of the processes and parameters that we have identified by means of key terms. What would compression, stretchiness or splicing, for instance, mean in the case of the novel or in the case of the short story? What would sequence, seriality or heat production mean in the case of mythological painting or landscape examples? We will approach the turn to the ornamental in late Victorian art asking whether it can be taken as evidence of a new logic of seriality predicated on the one-message-at-a time capability of the telegraph. Is the possibility of sequential encryption and decryption routinely adopted in telegraph-age literary and artistic culture? A focus on the associations and imaginings attendant on the telegraph will make it possible for us as scholars to acknowledge genre distinctions and attend to the specificities of different media and audiences but at the same time to develop interdisciplinary arguments of broad significance about Victorian culture.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This interdisciplinary project on science in culture will bring together a number of relatively distinct constituencies, from those with an interest in the history of communications technologies or maritime history to those with an interest in Victorian literature and art. In every case there are bridges to be built between the academic specialists and the lay enthusiasts some of whom bring formidable levels of expertise to their participation. Involving the public at all stages will sophisticate our understanding of the issues and bring key ideas from the research to these publics. We will find non-academic participants through special interest groups both local and national, for e.g. local networks on telegraphy through the Institution of Engineering and Technology; the Science Museum London and the Museum of Science and Industry, Manchester; art and literature enthusiasts through the William Morris Society (UK and USA); the Friends of the Watts Gallery; the Trollope Society; the Kipling Society. 

A public symposium and an international conference at The Courtauld Institute for academics, students, school students, and interested members of the public will be publicized through the Courtauld Research Forum which has staff dedicated to outreach. The KCL partnership with the Times Cheltenham Science Festival and the Times Cheltenham Literary Festival will offer opportunities for the presentation of aspects of the research to engaged festival-going publics. We plan visits to each of these festivals at a mid-point in the research project. 

The project includes an exhibition which will present ideas and links emerging from the research to a London exhibition-going public in a venue where the cross-links of art and science are regularly addressed. We are presenting a proposal for this exhibition to the National Maritime Museum and to the Wellcome Institute having instituted discussion with each. At the Wellcome it may be possible to mount an exhibition where one section of the exhibition relates to space, time, the body, and coding in a Victorian context and another section approaches these issues in relation to contemporary art and science. Whether at the Wellcome or at the NMM we will introduce an audioguide and use music, referencing Wheatstone's concertina, as one element of the experience (aiming to reinforce the argument about the somatic through the somatic aspects of the music); this will attract media interest. These venues have been selected on the basis of their strong records of focused exhibitions offered to a broad public where detailed historical investigations, complex ideas relating to the history of science and visual and aesthetic issues can be presented to visitors including school students, tourists from the UK and abroad, technophiles and consumers of culture spanning a wide age range. A messaging aspect of the exhibition (chance to take away a coded message on a paper strip) and interactive elements in the website will appeal especially to a media-conscious younger audience (from age 10-30). The strong awareness of C21st communications technologies among the younger age group offers us opportunities for serious engagement. Any exhibition webmaterials hosted by the exhibiting institution will be cross-linked to the project website designed and maintained by Department of Digital Humanities KCL and crosslinked to The Courtauld Institute's Research Forum website. A teacher resource (key stages 2 to 3) will be downloadable from the project website. Material relating to the exhibition will be incorporated into the project website which will include the enhanced web presentation of the Wheatstone collection. We seek to communicate effectively with the coming generation of scholars and enthusiasts with material that speaks to and builds on their global frameworks (and possibly abstract, theoretical assumptions) challenging them with a set of historical specifics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>731190</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Alexandra Bridarolli was the winner of a student competition to design a machine for the Victorians Decoded exhibition. Her winning entry, The Great Grammatizator was inspired by the machine of the same name from one of Roald Dahl's short stories Someone Like You. Based on the idea that human concepts and ideas are based on mechanical, mathematical principles (like music), the device produces self-constructed messages using a database of words. The messages have the structure of an Exquisite Corpse (from the French Cadaver Exquis), a creative method to produce sentences devised by the surrealists in 1918. As in the original game the message is a collaborative form of poetry produced between the device and the public.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4398FFC4-D565-457E-9F69-75F265357474</gtr:id><gtr:impact>People were instantly drawn to this interactive aspect of the exhibition.

This was a major outcome of our Research Project. The aim was to develop arguments about the cultural impact of the new technology associated with the telegraph by means of a scholarly exhibition and to communicate this research and thinking to the broadest possible public. Fine-art material and history-of- science material (paintings, illustration, charts, instruments, archival and printed material) was displayed. An interactive machine was installed, designed and built by the winner of a competition organised by the project. The exhibition was supported by free online scholarly catalogue. Curator talks, student group visits and schools activities including a photography competition and a takeover day were organised. A two-day international conference Coding and Representation based around the exhibition's themes was organised to coincide with the end of the exhibition. Exhibition was open free to the public in a central London venue. Total visits: 28,458. In October 2016: 7,749
Comments included 'it leaves an impression that is quite hard to define. The art is particularly moving and the scale of the original telecommunications process makes one feel small yet connected to mankind.'
'The juxtaposition of the equipment and engineering objects with the thematic groups of paintings is really surprising and illuminating.'
'It has made me think about how the technology and implications has affected Victorian art.'
'Maps and examples of networks made me reflect on current global communications networks.
'The exhibition introduced me to art and artists that I had little or no knowledge of. the links made between art and science within this exhibition are imaginative and provocative.'
Comments left on visitor feedback forms in the exhibition.
'Far from &amp;quot;Scrambled Messages&amp;quot;, the exhibition succeeds in clearly communicating intricate arguments about the resonances of cable technology throughout Victorian art, and posits new ways of thinking about the relationship between technology and culture: not as one of direct, telegraphic transmissions, but rather encouraging us to read for subtler currents of influence permeating through the Victorian imagination in richly inventive ways.&amp;quot; Charlotte Mathieson, Review in Journal of Victorian Culture (2017).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.scrambledmessages.ac.uk/scrambled-messages-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Throwaway Holmes', lecture for Cambridge University Summer School</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64364BB6-5933-4189-8C14-FB7BE2555377</gtr:id><gtr:impact>International and domestic students and UK school teachers asked lots of questions afterwards.

Masterclasses and talks for the public included flintknapping with archaeologist Karl Lee, a 'smell walk' with Dr Victoria Henshaw and 'bodging' and repairing with designer Jasleen Kaur, for example. During our large open days we threw wide the doors of the Makespace and the Materials Library to the public and organised various making activities designed to appeal to seasoned makers, first-time tinkerers and families alike, and curated a themed selection of materials for visitors to explore in the Materials Library. Themes have included 'Plastic Fantastic', 'Luminescence' and 'Foam', for example. We have had many return visitors at these public open days, and the public engagement programme has inspired people to explore new areas of interest, acquire new skills, and engage with experts in diverse fields of materials research and making. For a full list of events up until March 2014, see our annual report: http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/blog/2014/05/first-year-report and for events since then, see the URL below.

Between 2013 and 2014 we hosted eight public open days at UCL with a total attendance of approximately 3500 including a high representation from families and children. Through these events the public get both a taste of the Makespace and Materials Library, and a chance to meet and interact with our wonderful and knowledgeable community of members. This public programme is extremely popular, with many events being booked up in less than five minutes of being released and with extensive waiting lists forming. For example, 1156 people applied to attend Roja Dove: An Olfactory Experience, for which there were only 40 spaces available. We instigated the first Festival of Materials and Making at King's College, and have instituted an annual Festival of Stuff at UCL.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk/events</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project workshop on the Body with invited participants (scholars, curators)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9687DFA8-A604-4BA2-8E46-2AF6BF0D98B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project investigators communicated scope and principles of project, giving keynote opening presentation as well as overall oragnisation and formal response to each presentation.

The materials library contains more than a thousand material samples. Some are exotic, such as aerogel, uranium glass or self-healing concrete, but the vast majority are the materials used in everyday practice and in manufacturing around the world. Our Institute also contains a fully kitted-out workshop containing a laser cutter, milling machine, kiln, kitchen, 3D printer, sewing machines etc. We do not have every tool, but we but we aim to provide a representative sample of different making
techniques. Our aim is to create a workshop where you use the materials discovered in the library to prototype ideas or explore how they behave when processed in different ways to better understand their affordances. Together, these two resources and the connection between them create the right environment where complex problems that sit outside the traditional boundaries of any one discipline can be addressed. The hands-on testing of existing material objects and processes, an exploration of the Materials Library and the construction of prototypes all become part of the thinking process. This is problem-solving by doing: not because theory is irrelevant to tackling complex problems, but because making stuff stimulates a different set of ideas and a creative approach.</gtr:description><gtr:id>17BBF3DF-2644-454D-A808-42712A0291C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A fundamental change in the materials research culture of the UK, and increasingly internationally, to focus as much on hands-on experimentation as a method of building interdisciplinary research teams and projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The Institute of Making</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.instituteofmaking.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F24B9288-314F-413E-A80B-9F9BE923DCB6"><gtr:id>F24B9288-314F-413E-A80B-9F9BE923DCB6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Review of Eleni Ikoniadou and Scott Wilson, eds., Media After Kittler (London and New York: Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield International, 2015)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Media History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3801c1d167ee8397cf2dc2bf1878f476"><gtr:id>3801c1d167ee8397cf2dc2bf1878f476</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pettitt C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5F8400E-70BE-479D-AA23-BC138CAEBFC5"><gtr:id>D5F8400E-70BE-479D-AA23-BC138CAEBFC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Victorians Decoded: Art and Telgraphy.
