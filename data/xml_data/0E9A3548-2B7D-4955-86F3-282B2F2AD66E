important determinant of viral fitness</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0701215</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) typically sets up a life-long infection often leading to severe liver disease and death. Current drug treatments are expensive and do not work well. Our research aims to characterise unexplored components of the virus life cycle that might be suitable as new targets for drug development. 
A feature of HCV is that it produces all the different proteins needed for viral replication from one single large protein, referred to as a polyprotein. This is done by both viral and cellular proteases, special proteins that cleave the polyprotein into its individual parts.
We are starting to understand the role many of these viral proteins have, most of which are essential for HCV replication. However, our research indicates that the intermediate products generated during the cleavage of the polyprotein are also required for viral replication to occur.
The challenge now is to work out which are the important intermediates and what functions they have. We are also looking at whether subtle differences exist between different strains of HCV in the way that they cleave their viral polyprotein. This might provide an explanation as to why some strains are more resistant to current anti-viral therapy than others.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is prevalent throughout the world and is responsible for severe liver disease in up to 30% individuals who become chronically infected with the virus, manifestations of which include hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and liver failure. Current regimes used to treat infection are only partially effective, necessitating the need for further research of this infectious agent.

HCV possesses a positive-strand RNA genome that encodes for a single polyprotein from which both structural and non-structural proteins are derived. The non-structural proteins, which are responsible for replication of the RNA genome within the infected cell, are principally released from this polyprotein as a result of the action of the major viral protease, NS3. However, the rate of cleavage by NS3 differs considerably between the different cleavage sites within the polyprotein, the result of which is that only certain transient polyprotein intermediates are present within an infected cell, and release of fully processed non-structural proteins follows a reasonably well defined order.

Recent evidence has emerged suggesting that for certain members of the Picornaviridae family of viruses, rates of processing of transient polyprotein intermediates might play an essential role in viral replication. It is hypothesised that a similar requirement will exist in HCV. Preliminary data presented within this proposal, where viral replication was severely impaired when cleavage of a slowly processed boundary was enhanced such that alternative transient precursor products were observed, supports this assumption. My aim is to further investigate this unexplored and novel aspect of HCV replication, both establishing its importance for viral replication and how it might play a role in determining the outcome of mixed genotype infections, as well as determining what functions it serves. Valuable insights gained from this schedule of proposed work has the potential to drive translational research into the development of novel antiviral products.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-11-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>348060</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Life Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Centre for Biological Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>NS4B function and form in artificial membranes</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F41D6CD-4736-4D44-AB2F-45CDE8A8E656</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A publication at the beginning of 2015 has come about as a result of this collaboration (Biochim Biophys Acta (2015) 1848; 1671-7)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The structural biologists in the Centre for Biological Sciences have shown that NS4B can be reconstituted into artificial small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs: lipid membranes).

The restrictions with this system are that (1) temporal expression of the two forms of the two proteins is not tightly co-regulated and (2) often a helper virus is required, meaning that the functional form of the protein being investigated can only be expressed in the context of a viral polyprotein. Both of these restrictions limit what can be achieved when using complementation systems to investigate viral replication. We have developed an alternative solution which overcomes the technical issues associated with recombination and allows defects to be complemented by expressing a second functional copy of the protein (either as a single protein or polyprotein precursor) within the same RNA being rescued. The work forms the basis of a second publication from the MRC grant G0701215 that was published in Journal of Virology in March 2014. The constructs have since been made available to the research community</gtr:description><gtr:id>6EFDB45D-0157-4687-872C-793E02D34C2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have been able to use confocal microscopy to investigate targetting of viral proteins to the viral replication complex in a quantative manner, something that would not have been possible using a trans-complementation system. We have also used it to find evidence that virion assembly doesn't necessarily rely on nascent RNA generated from the replication complex (see other outputs). Both observations have lead to a publication in Journal of Virology in 2014 (mentioned above). A follow-up study, accepted for publication in Journal of Virology at the end of 2015 also shows that the system allows the formation of truly mixed-composition replication complexes, enabling researchers to look at dominant negative properties of proteins.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>intragenomic complementation constructs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://jvi.asm.org/content/88/5/2748.short</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The HCV protein NS4B, has the unusual ability to translocate its NH2 end across the ER membrane.
