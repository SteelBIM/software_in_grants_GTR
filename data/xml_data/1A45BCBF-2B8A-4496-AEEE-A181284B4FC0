Conversely, people sometimes find that they are unrecognized, called by the wrong name, or forced to remind someone about the details of a past conversation. Modern science can say quite a bit about this first set of experiences, about forgetting other people. Who and what we forget has been a major theme in psychological research since its beginnings. Strikingly, however, modern science can say almost nothing about the experience of being forgotten, defined here as having one's identity, characteristics, or actions (including verbal statements) misremembered or not remembered by another person. This omission is especially odd as being forgotten can clearly have a large interpersonal impact (e.g., having one's birthday forgotten by family or close friends, or having one's name forgotten in repeated meetings) and might thus function as an unrecognized channel of social information in interpersonal interaction. 

I propose that, relative to being remembered, being forgotten signals that the subject of forgetting is unimportant, that is, not worthy of sustained attention and thought. This is a reasonable inference for people to draw because memory actually does reflect importance; greater care and attention leads to better memory, all other things being equal. 
 
A first set of studies will test the idea that being forgotten signals unimportance in two ways. In some studies, people will watch videos of interactions in which one person forgets another and will then be asked what they infer about the interaction that they witnessed. In another study, people will be asked to keep a diary of their daily experiences of being forgotten, and those daily records will be coded and analyzed to extract both a description of being forgotten in daily life as well as information about what people infer and feel when they are forgotten. 
 
A second set of studies will examine how being forgotten interacts with other signals of importance, specifically with direct verbal communications of importance and with non-verbal indications of importance. Forgetting provides genuine evidence of resource investment (i.e., time and energy), whereas direct verbal communications about importance or non-verbal indications of importance can be produced spontaneously. Because of this asymmetry, I suspect that the importance conveyed by forgetting will be given more weight than either direct verbal communications about importance or non-verbal indications of importance. That is, forgetting might be interpreted as a relatively honest signal of importance. 
 
In these studies, participants will watch recorded communications in which memory and forgetting will sometimes occur alongside other signals of importance and will sometimes be separated from other signals of importance. Participants will then report their beliefs about the thoughts and feelings of the person in the recorded communication. These studies will systematically examine instances in which memory and forgetting converge with other signals of importance, as well as instances in which memory and forgetting suggest different conclusions than do other signals of importance. These studies will thus determine if memory and forgetting can enhance the content of communications consistent with the importance implied by memory and forgetting as well whether memory and forgetting undermine communications that are inconsistent with the importance implied by memory and forgetting.
 
A key strength of this program is that it examines multiple facets of being forgotten with multiple methods. The proposed studies investigate the experience and implications of being forgotten both inside and outside the lab, as well as how being forgotten interfaces with other communications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work is likely to have both short-term and long-term impact. In the short term, this work's impact comes from its immediate relevance to daily human life. Almost everyone has had the experience of forgetting someone else (e.g., forgetting a name, forgetting the details of a past conversation) and of being forgotten themselves (e.g., being called by the wrong name, having to remind others about past commitments). This means that anyone who is interested in better understanding day-to-day experiences and social interactions is a stakeholder who stands to benefit from the insight and understanding likely to be derived from this research. This shorter-term impact will be supported through rigorous public engagement drawing on the world class public engagement infrastructure in place at the University of Aberdeen. 

In the longer term, this work is relevant to the effective management of ageing and memory loss. A reduction in memory performance is part of normal ageing and becomes more extreme is clinical cases such as Alzheimer's disease. Generally, such memory deficits receive attention in the context of decision making and daily functioning. As age-related memory impairment extends to social information, however, such memory impairment is likely also relevant for interpersonal functioning (i.e., the maintenance of existing social relationships or the formation of new social relationships). This work will provide a framework with which to integrate the social implications of age related or clinically caused changes in memory performance with the social role of memory and forgetting broadly speaking. In turn, such integration is likely to have actionable implications for effectively managing social relationships and social integration across the lifespan. This longer term impact will be supported through interdisciplinary engagement and dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>189487</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented at the Brisith Psychological Society, Social Section, Annual Conference 2016 (#1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>09EC87A0-4F10-48CD-BEFE-07D34DE4BC2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We presented our findings to date at the Annual meeting of the British Psychological Society, Social section.

The project involves two strands of research with seven planned studies. As of this report, the research program is on schedule. 

Our first strand of research examines what people infer from being forgotten and how being forgotten affects social relationships. Our findings so far suggest that memory signals importance, such that when people are remembered, they infer that they are more important to the person remembering, whereas when people are forgotten, they infer that they are less important. Furthermore, these inferences about importance appear to affect the quality of the relationship between the person remembering or forgetting and the person who is the object of memory or forgetting. Specifically, forgetting appears to damage the relationship between the two parties. 

Our second strand of research compares communications of memory to verbal and non-verbal communications of importance. The findings so far from this strand of research suggest that communications of memory and verbal communications of importance convey importance to a fairly similar degree. However, communications of memory appear to be stronger signals of importance than non-verbal communications of importance.

Our third strand of research examines whether people can be coached to use memory in order to communicate importance more effectively. Our findings so far suggests that, people spontaneously use evidence of memory to add credibility to communication, but do not do so optimally. Moreover, a simple instruction to deliberately employ evidence of memory during communication makes communication more credible and effective. 

The current research provides systematic insight into an experience most people encounter in their daily lives: being forgotten. This research will thus provide people everywhere with a better understanding of their social interactions and relationships with tools to improve communication credibility. In the longer term, this research also has the potential to provide new insights into improving the social relationships of people with impairments in memory due to ageing or clinical disorders of memory (e.g., Alzheimer's disease).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We plan to publish these findings in journals within our field to share with the wider academic community. Once published, we also plan to share our findings with the general public through interviews with the media. These findings have the potential to benefit social relationships by providing new understanding into how memory and forgetting affects social interactions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D871AC24-5EFF-4652-80CF-BADE9888D63C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L008173/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
