As such, when learning tasks as simple as tying one's shoes or as complex as performing heart surgery, we learn by watching others, from childhood through to old age.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Many researchers from the behavioural and brain sciences suggest that observational and physical learning share common features. What remains unknown is how our brains and behaviour change when learning by observation across the lifespan, as well as how age impacts the efficacy of observational learning.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To address these questions, this project measures the impact of observational learning on behaviour and brain activity among children, young adults, and older adults. An innovative training paradigm featuring dance learning in conjunction with Xbox Kinect? technology is used with each age group.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The objective is to teach participants dance sequences either via physical practice or observation, and to use brain imaging in conjunction with multivariate analytical approaches to map out how both kinds of learning impact brain activity and physical performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The ultimate aim is to develop a means of identifying factors associated with observational learning success, which in turn will inform observation-based interventions used in education and therapeutic contexts.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 'Watch and Learn' project stands to benefit a wide sample of society beyond academia via at least four distinct avenues:
1. Influencing Behaviour &amp;amp; Informing Interventions: Because we vary in how we learn best, one-size-fits-all teaching strategies frequently fail due to individual differences in learning abilities. Social science research is critical for understanding how we learn, and yet, most work measures behaviour among a group of individuals and then generalizes to the wider population. My project takes an important step forward in understanding individual learning differences at behavioural and brain levels. Findings will inform how to identify those who learn effectively by observation, as well as how the profile of observational learning changes during the lifespan. Planned outreach activities through schools and national/international science festivals will enable me to communicate my findings on individual differences, as well as engage in dialogue with educators who use observational learning. 
2. Using Technology to Understand Behaviour: Recent exciting technological developments have been made in video game equipment. The 'Watch and Learn' project takes advantage of the wireless motion tracking technology offered by the Xbox Kinect system (made by Microsoft) to quantify and track physical and observational learning in individuals ranging from pre-adolescence through to old age. Microsoft is interested in liaising with basic science researchers who use the Kinect technology in innovative ways to understand or change human behavior. As the project develops, I will discuss my findings, learn how to better optimize the Kinect system for my research needs, and engage Microsoft in discussions about how their technology and my paradigm could possibly be marketed for educational or therapeutic uses.
3. Healthy Aging: A great utility exists for observational learning interventions directed toward those with reduced mobility or impaired motor function due to aging or neurological injury. In older age, subtle improvements in motor performance can have a profound influence on quality of life. For example, improved ability and confidence in one's ability to carry out daily tasks, such as making a cup of tea or preparing dinner, can lead to independence and less reliance on care workers. Findings from the proposed research will not only pave the way for possible interventions to assist with new task learning in advanced age, but will also lead to a brain-based model of the underlying mechanism(s) controlling learning by observation, which might aid in understanding how to prevent its decline. Through links with the University of the Third age and the NHS (see Pathways to Impact), the project builds links between medical practitioners, researchers and the wider public, with the aim of disseminating findings to end users who could influence policy and implement interventions with older individuals.
4. Knowledge Exchange: A hallmark of quality research in the social sciences is direct engagement and dialogue with those individuals who might apply the latest research findings to their daily practice. The 'Watch and Learn' project seeks to achieve this through a dedicated knowledge exchange forum, as part of a 2-day workshop toward the end of the project that gathers leading researchers, educators, and therapists who use observational learning techniques in their work. Importantly, this forum will focus on two-way discussion between the research and practice experts, with active encouragement for those individuals who use observational learning techniques in their practice to provide detailed feedback on their needs to the researchers so that our work can be more quickly and effectively used in applied contexts.

As detailed in the Academic Beneficiaries section, the project also stands to benefit academic users ranging from colleagues working with evidence-based research to those studying learning in other departments.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Psychology Seminar, University of Bristol</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>266F8D20-BAB8-4C5C-8FC4-DD91374AFED4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented search seminar at University of Bristol School of Psychology well attended by about 35 members of staff and students, which sparked lively discussion about research looking at learning and robots</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development Seminar Series, Birkbeck</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>721B0A12-26E4-4DD1-9072-B6ECBC218444</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Roughly 40 academics attended this departmental talk that focused on more developmental aspects of the work that led to and has come from the Watch and Learn project

This research combined interactive dance video games with brain scanning and has shown that multisensory, interactive learning contexts (such as those involving vision, audition and physical activity) lead to the best gains in learning and have the most impact on the brain. Another significant contribution of this work concerns the relationship between physical experience/embodiment and action memory. We have found that learning efficacy (from either visual or physical experience) is directly related to action memory, and ongoing follow-up work will seek to capitlise on this relationship to diagnose or ameliorate physical learning difficulties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Education practitioners and those invovled in sporting contexts could be interested in the findings.
