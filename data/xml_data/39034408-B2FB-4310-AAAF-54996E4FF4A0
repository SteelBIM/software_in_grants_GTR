We take many perspectives towards reaching this goal from studying high-redshift massive galaxies to low mass galaxies in the nearby universe. We provide below a summary of each project:

Project 1: Massive galaxies undergo two major transformations in the distant Universe. Their star formation is abruptly switched off, and they also transform from disc-like (or irregular) systems into compact spheroids. The aim of this project is to understand and disentangle these transformative processes. We focus in particular on a unique sample of galaxies, caught in the act of being quenched.

Project 2: How galaxies evolve is affected by both their internal properties (e.g., mass, morphology) and the environment where they live. We will study many thousands of galaxies as they fall into clusters along the cosmic filamentary web. In doing so, we will be able to learn how the different environments (filaments, groups and clusters) affect galaxies with a very broad range of mases and morphologies.

Project 3: Although we see galaxies being dramatically affected by their environment, the process is elusive in large samples due to its speed and the concealing effects of dust. Without statistics, it is hard to pin-down the influence of different environments and see how changes in star-formation and structure are related. We seek to resolve these issues by developing and applying exciting new methods.

Project 4: We use large scale numerical simulations of the intergalactic medium to examine the interplay between galaxies and gas in the early Universe. In the next few years quasar surveys will provide fresh observational insight into this topic. Modelling with numerical simulations unlocks the full potential of these data, allowing us to study the properties of galaxies when the Universe was less than a quarter of its current age.

Project 5: We will use data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to determine the evolution of low-mass galaxies and how these relate to the formation of large galaxies. The properties of low luminosity galaxies are still largely unknown, but DES now allows us to determine the star formation histories and morphologies of these low luminosity galaxies and how they relate to the formation of their central galaxies.

Project 6: Will the large strong gravitational lens datasets expected from forthcoming surveys by facilities like Euclid and LSST really meet claims regarding insights into the structure and evolution of galaxies? By applying globally used modelling techniques to lensed images formed by ray-tracing in simulations of structure formation, this will be answered, with suggested remedies for any shortfalls found.

Project 7: We will take steps towards understanding galaxy cluster formation by quantifying the important baryonic components of forming clusters: galaxies, supermassive black holes, and the diffuse gas that lies between the galaxies. We will use our recently discovered, large sample of forming clusters in the very early Universe to measure these important constituents for the first time.

Project 8: integral-field unit spectroscopic surveys are offering a whole new dimension of information about galaxies. We will develop new tools to exploit this wealth of data, and apply them to understanding the structure and evolution of lenticular galaxies. To do so, we will exploit our membership of the SDSS-4 MaNGA survey, which is studying an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies.

Project 9: This project seeks to build a new simulation package designed to reproduce the underlying cosmological framework of out Universe in an extremely accurate and controlled manner suited to the stringent requirements of the latest galaxy surveys. It will also populate this framework with a wide range of the latest mock galaxy formation methods forming highly realistic versions of our Universe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is embedded in the culture and working of the Group, and we have a well-established track record in its delivery.
 
Our extensive outreach program includes all the activities traditionally associated with astronomy. We give talks at schools, astronomical societies and events, both locally and across the country. We write popular articles and books. We engage with the media both through regular contributions and one-off press releases presenting our work. 
 
However, we are also committed to pushing boundaries in outreach by undertaking novel activities to reach new audiences in new ways. We have a track record of collaborating with artists to produce engagingly different events and installations. We are involved in the organisation of the citizen science movement to directly involve the public in our research. We have developed a programme of outreach to local schools that prioritises widening participation, which uses an inflatable planetarium (for which we obtained the funding) as the focus for the activity. We have established a very strong presence on YouTube through the Sixty Symbols and Deep Sky Videos channels, reaching a subscriber base of in excess of half a million people all across the World. 
 
We also work across the breadth of knowledge exchange. We have developed our success in video presentation by producing YouTube series for external organisations (including STFC). We have spun out an outreach-related company that produces realistic renderings of astronomical objects in glass. We have assisted in the application of our research to other fields, such as the implementation of the scheme we developed for allocating telescope time to the award of grant funding by the NSF. We have collaborated with engineers in the University to apply our expertise in fluid dynamics to modelling jet engines for Rolls Royce.
 
It is in the nature of innovative research that one cannot predict the precise areas in which possible impact will arise, so it is important to maintain a flexible attitude to its exploitation (whilst insuring that it is not relegated to a minor role because of this uncertainty). The way in which impact is embedded in the culture of the Group ensures that we are in a position to capture and exploit these opportunities as they arise, and our clear strong track record in this area demonstrates that we actually do so in practice. We fully intend to continue with this committed flexible approach through the period of this Consolidated Grant.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1242542</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P000614/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
