These 'pili' or 'fimbriae' contain at their tip a special protein molecule, called an adhesin, which allows the bacteria to attach to the host cell surface, thereby initiating the process of infection. These hair-like structures are formed from the assembly of hundreds of copies of protein subunits with similar structure into a long polymer chain linked by non-covalent interactions between each subunit. A complex folding and assembly machinery known as the chaperone-usher pathway is responsible for the assembly of these pili, typified by the P pili of uropathogenic E. coli. Key components of this pathway include (i) a specific chaperone which is needed to fold the pilus subunit into an assembly-competent conformation and to prevent premature subunit assembly in the periplasmic space; (ii) the pilus subunits themselves which, in the case of P pili, involves six different subunit types; and (iii) an outer membrane-embedded usher protein, which acts as the assembly platform where chaperone:pilus subunit complexes are brought to the basal end of the growing pilus for subsequent incorporation into the growing fibre. In a manner that is currently not understood, and is entirely independent of ATP, the usher catalyzes pilus assembly, adds a defined, specially chosen subunit to the base of the growing pilus, and extrudes it to the outer surface of the bacterium. The usher also serves as an anchor, tethering the pilus to the bacterial surface, arming the bacterium for attack. In recent years the X-ray structures of several pilus chaperones have been elucidated, along with many pilus subunits (known as pilins). Fascinatingly, these studies have shown that pilins have a common structure, based on an immunoglobulin (Ig) fold. However, whilst the canonical Ig fold contains seven ?-strands, the pilins have only six strands and their structure is thus incomplete and unstable. One role of the chaperone is to donate a ?-strand to the pilus subunit, temporarily completing its content of ?-strands. During pilus assembly the chaperone's ?-stand is then displaced from its binding site by the incoming pilin subunit, which forms a new ?-strand from its initially disordered N-terminal region (known as the N-terminal extension (Nte)), resulting in a very stable, intermolecular chain of Ig molecules. The ordered assembly of bacterial pili provides a fascinating problem in structural biology and molecular recognition that has far-reaching impact. First, it poses important fundamental questions about molecular self-assembly mechanisms and asks to what extent these are dictated by the biophysical properties of the amino acid chain (its sequence, or the kinetics or thermodynamics of the interactions) and how these are controlled, modulated and/or coordinated in vivo. Secondly, and equally importantly, elucidation of the molecular mechanism of pilus formation has immense importance for the possible development of new anti-microbial agents against bacterial infection mediated by pili. In this proposal we describe a series of experiments involving three applicants with complementary expertise that aim to reveal how proteins assemble into pili in unprecedented detail. Specifically, our aims are to determine the role of the N-terminal extension (Nte), the chaperone:subunit complex, and the soluble N-terminal domain of the membrane-bound usher in defining and controlling the order of subunit-assembly. Finally using our ability to purify intact functional usher protein we aim to develop an assay capable of providing the first insights into pilus assembly at a membrane surface in vitro.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Many pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli and Salmonella enterica, produce proteinaceous fibres, known as adhesive pili, on their surfaces that initiate the invasion of the host and are crucial for pathogenesis. These highly ordered protein assemblies are fascinating biopolymers, being comprised of hundreds of contiguous copies of immunoglobulin domains, assembled non-covalently in a precise order. Each pilus subunit folds, in a chaperone-dependent manner, to a structure based on an incomplete immunoglobulin fold, which is subsequently completed by the donation intermolecularly of a single ?/strand from an adjacent subunit formed by its N-terminal extension (Nte). Despite the importance of this biological self-assembly process from both fundamental and applied viewpoints, the structural molecular mechanism by which proteins assemble into pili is not understood. Key questions concern how the precise order of subunits within the pilus is determined and the role of the chaperone and membrane-bound usher in controlling or adapting the assembly mechanism in vivo. Here we propose to use non-covalent mass spectrometry combined with structural analysis, kinetic and thermodynamic measurements, protein engineering and peptide design, to address these questions. Specifically, we will focus on P pili of uropathogenic E. coli associated with pyelonephritis (Pap) pili as a model, a system we have shown to be highly tractable for the experiments proposed, to determine the roles of the N-terminal extension (Nte), the pilin:chaperone complex and the soluble N-terminal domain of the usher protein and in defining and controlling the order of subunit-assembly. Finally, using our ability to purify intact functional usher protein we aim to develop an assay capable of providing the first insights into pilus assembly at a membrane surface in vitro.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-02-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>433330</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Understanding</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>38931CFF-45E8-4737-A985-CFB6DCDC1D81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organisng Committee of the Biochemical Society One day Young Life Scientists symposium: Morrissey, July 2011

Released my PA for a day to allow her and her daughter (who recently had Work Experience in the my Lab) to attend to represent FBS and enthuse show-goers about FBS in particular, and biology in general
The event was aimed at schoolchildren, to enthuse and inform them about biology and encourage them to choose it as a school subject, University subject and career choice. We had a stand with several interactive activities aimed at children of various ages and abilities such as making a model of an axon, mirror-writing, looking at a skeleton and discussing its form in relation to its function, various exercise-related activities, and the opportunity to handle an artificial hip joint.
My PA's daughter surprised herself at how well she did with this, and she is halfway through her BSc in Biological Sciences at Birmingham.
The event attracted scores of schoolchildren, parents and members of the public, and the level of enthusiasm on the stand was excellent.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Understanding</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F20F1BD3-A793-47A3-B86B-888BB8FDC82E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture and campus-wide molecular biology seminar, University of California at Los Angeles &amp;quot;To Fold or Not to Fold: How Well Evolved is Nature's Folding Code?&amp;quot; Radford, 7th January 2010

enterica) produce hair-like structures on their surfaces. These &amp;quot;pili&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;fimbriae&amp;quot; contain at their tip a special protein
molecule, called an adhesin, which allows the bacteria to attach to the host cell surface, thereby initiating the process of
infection. These hair-like structures are formed from the assembly of hundreds of copies of protein subunits with similar
structure into a long polymer chain linked by non-covalent interactions between each subunit that have to assemble in a
specific order in order to be functional. To make this happen, a specific chaperone is used to fold the pilus subunit into an
assembly-competent conformation and an outer membrane-embedded protein, called the usher then assembles the pilus
and pushed each subunit out of the bacteria in a specific order. The usher also serves as an anchor, tethering the pilus to
the bacterial surface, arming the bacterium for attack.
Understanding how the usher orchestrates folding of pili is fascinating, fundamental question in biology. It is also of
importance since disabling pilus assembly may provide a new route for the creation of anti-microbial compounds, much
needed in the background of the rapid evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In this project we developed novel assays
using mass spectrometry to work out how the pilus subunits assemble in such a specific manner. Two different approaches
were taken. First, we looked at the extent to which subunit assembly specificity is inherently encoded in the different amino
acid sequences found in each subunit type. We then expanded on these results to examine how the usher protein itself
brings about rapid and specific assembly. New tasks for different parts of the usher were discovered using the approach we
developed, and we were able to propose relay of hand-over-hand passing of different subunits to different parts of the
usher to bring about specific assembly. Finally, and in very exciting experiments, we used mass spectrometry to examine
the intact usher protein itself in the act of pilus assembly. This was a major feat of experimentation since the analysis of
membrane proteins using mass spectrometry, especially large protein complexes, is at the very forefront of this technology.
This work has not yet been published, but it paves the way for an analysis of pilus assembly in real time and, in the future,
could provide important information into how potential inhibitors of pilus assembly act.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Publications, conferences and other communications</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>91DC4712-D38C-474C-93FD-6D6AA3D25BE5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F871E256-BF3F-408D-A400-0F70B32FEBB7"><gtr:id>F871E256-BF3F-408D-A400-0F70B32FEBB7</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of chaperone-subunit usher domain interactions in the mechanism of bacterial pilus biogenesis revealed by ESI-MS.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7470ffa17883f984cda6dca75c200ea6"><gtr:id>7470ffa17883f984cda6dca75c200ea6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morrissey B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1535-9476</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E49971BE-056D-4D8E-A385-07C05E66E737"><gtr:id>E49971BE-056D-4D8E-A385-07C05E66E737</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of chaperone-subunit usher domain interactions in the mechanism of bacterial pilus biogenesis revealed by ESI-MS.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecular &amp; cellular proteomics : MCP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7470ffa17883f984cda6dca75c200ea6"><gtr:id>7470ffa17883f984cda6dca75c200ea6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Morrissey B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1535-9476</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/62773800-27C8-47F9-95D5-FE9A47CB8E0D"><gtr:id>62773800-27C8-47F9-95D5-FE9A47CB8E0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Second order rate constants of donor-strand exchange reveal individual amino acid residues important in determining the subunit specificity of pilus biogenesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08f2e36728fdcefa0fe43a3592434df8"><gtr:id>08f2e36728fdcefa0fe43a3592434df8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Leney AC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1044-0305</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FA9EC32C-E935-4871-B5C1-E11680172CDE"><gtr:id>FA9EC32C-E935-4871-B5C1-E11680172CDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>An in vivo platform for identifying inhibitors of protein aggregation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature chemical biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/daed557fec84c02fa94fb0bc28544433"><gtr:id>daed557fec84c02fa94fb0bc28544433</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Saunders JC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1552-4450</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/F012284/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
