However, it is often not the genes themselves that are the targets of potential drugs, but the thousands of proteins encoded by these genes. In order to understand how proteins perform their various tasks, we need to know the structure of these proteins. The most effective technique for determining protein structure is X-ray crystallography which requires high quality crystals of the proteins. The current structural genomics/proteomics projects worldwide have set out to determine the structures of 100,000 proteins but in spite of investing considerable funds and effort, they have had limited success because obtaining crystals is a major bottleneck to progress. There is an urgent need for new and improved ways to enable the growth of crystals.The problem lies in either getting no crystals at all, or even more frustrating - getting crystals that are not of a high enough quality to allow structure determination. The ultimate means to obtain good crystals is to control their conception stage, i.e. the nucleation stage which is the first step that determines the entire crystallization process. This is not an easy task hence the Holy grail is to find a 'universal nucleant' - a substrate that would induce crystallization of any protein. Several substances such as minerals, human hair, silicas have been used as nucleants, but with limited success. PRPs can selectively recognize particular proteins and therefore are very likely to serve as the ideal nucleants because rather than use random materials as nucleants, it will be possible to prepare PRPs for each protein while it is in solution and then get it to crystallise using that PRP. The results of the protein crystallisation studies will enable optimization of the PRPs for general protein capture applications (e.g. protein extraction and protein biosensing). The PRP technology is still in its infancy and proper characterisation methods do not currently exist. The nucleation studies will allow an interesting route to the feedback of essential information regarding whether parameters such as crosslinking density and choice of monomers can lead to better PRP formation. Biosensors for proteins are currently expensive to develop because they require the use of expensive antibodies. Because of the biomimicry capabilities (and their potential to act as synthetic antibodies), PRPs potentially offer a route to the development of new low-cost biosensors for cancer markers and bioterrorism markers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>149067</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Plenary talk European Crystal Growth Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3C98CF6-7A27-44B9-8DFF-6B802DCAC92D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards

While crystals are important substances in many scientific disciplines, their powerful visual presence and metaphorical associations have also intrigued artists and philosophers over many centuries. Although a crystal appears 'lifeless' or dead, it can also suggest life; it has grown from a solution or compond. The artists in this exhibition have been inspired in diferent ways by these complex, transient chemical processes, and by their many aesthetic possibilities.

In collaboration with a chemist/material scientist we succeeded in developing a totally unique means of nucleating protein crystals, by designing Molecularly Imprinted Polymers (MIPs) also referred to as &amp;quot;smart materials&amp;quot; for this purpose. The idea was to find a material that would specifically attract protein molecules to come together and form a crystal. MIPs are polymers formed in the presence of a molecule that is extracted afterwards, leaving complementary cavities behind. The cavities retain a memory of the molecule in the polymer and exhibit highly selective rebinding of the given molecule. In this study, MIPs were imprinted with protein molecules. The fingerprint of the protein created on the polymer enables it to serve as an ideal template for its crystal formation.

We have shown that MIPs are effective in both the screening and optimisation stages of crystallization. MIP-containing screening trials (in a widely used commercial screen) yielded promising hits for three proteins that had not produced useful crystals to date. No hits were obtained in the absence of MIPs or in the presence of traditional nucleants, meaning that without MIPs these important hits would have been missed.



An additional key discovery was that better crystals could be obtained in the presence of MIPs at the optimization stage. Nine proteins out of ten tested produced higher quality crystals (as measured by X-ray diffraction), notably of an HIV protein complex (4.2 &amp;Aring; compared to 9 &amp;Aring; previously).



The findings went beyond our expectations: when embarking on the MIP experiments we expected that each MIP would work exclusively on its cognate protein and that it would be necessary to make a MIP for each protein to be crystallized. In practice, our results showed that a MIP imprinted with one protein could also be successfully used for other, size-compatible proteins. This is very important in the case of difficult to crystallize proteins, which are usually too scarce in supply for imprinting and would therefore benefit from the use of a related MIP. 



The results of this study open up a new scope for protein crystallization corroborating our hypothesis that by harnessing proteins as templates, MIPs become effective nucleation-inducing substrates.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The finding has been patented, the patent has been granted and a commercial product called 'Chayen Reddy MIP' is commercilaised and sold to pharmaceutical companies and academia by Imperial Innovations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ADF138F1-D63B-431F-B942-D419A65608CB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk/license/available-technologies/chayen-reddy-mip/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A new tool for inducing the growth of protein crystals</gtr:description><gtr:id>75093717-FAEB-4A69-96EC-02835E9C1AF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Obtaining crystasls that could not be obtaned before</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Chayen Reddy MIP</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk/license/available-technologies/chayen-reddy-mip/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/49E4CA6C-C8F1-45DE-B171-8F8D3E37766B"><gtr:id>49E4CA6C-C8F1-45DE-B171-8F8D3E37766B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Automating the application of smart materials for protein crystallization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta crystallographica.
