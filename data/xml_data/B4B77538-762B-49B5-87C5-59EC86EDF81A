The most baffling fact about this and related diseases such as sheep scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, Mad Cow Disease) is that they appear to be triggered by a unique class of infectious agent known as a prion (protein-only infectious agent). Although CJD is a comparatively rare disease in humans (approximately 1 in a million people will contract the disease in any one year), sufferers show many of the pathological features seen in individuals suffering from other more common, non-infectious diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. In spite of its infectious nature, the majority of cases of human CJD (~80%) are known to occur 'sporadically' i.e. appear spontaneously, without any evidence of the diseased individual acquiring an infectious prion from a third party, or through a mutation in the individual's genes. Prions are remarkable infectious agents because they consist only of a single protein that is a structurally altered form of a protein (called PrP) normally found in the brain. Yet we know remarkably little about how prions form spontaneously to cause sporadic CJD or for that matter what will trigger their formation. To help us address these questions we are proposing to study prions that are found in Baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Prions were first described in this fungus over 15 years ago and the many subsequent studies on yeast prions have revealed fascinating often surprising new aspects of prion biology not least the fact that their presence can be of benefit to the host they infect rather than detrimental. We are proposing to use two different yeast prions - called [PSI+] and [PIN+] - to identify what triggers the spontaneous formation of a prion in the cell. The approach we are taking is based on our recent discovery that certain potentially dangerous forms of oxygen known as 'reactive oxygen species' (or ROS for short) can trigger the spontaneous formation of the [PSI+] prion in yeast. In yeast cells lacking a defence system known to prevent such oxidative damage, the [PSI+] prion formed spontaneously at a remarkably high frequency. Because it is already known that ROS can also trigger the formation of the human prion that causes CJD then we believe that by using modern methods of genetics and biochemistry, we will be able to establish the significance of oxidative damage in triggering prion formation. This study will also be extended to include other human disease associated proteins whose misfolding also leads to brain degeneration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>What triggers the formation of both infectious and non-infectious amyloids in vivo represents a significant gap in our understanding of the etiology of a major family of human neurodegenerative diseases. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae we and others have shown that the frequency with which the yeast [PSI+] prion form of the Sup35 protein arises de novo is controlled by a number of genetic and environmental factors. Most significantly we have very recently shown that in yeast cells lacking the peroxiredoxin proteins Tsa1 and Tsa2, the frequency of de novo formation of [PSI+] is greatly elevated. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) play multiple roles in protecting cells against stress, including acting as antioxidants and suppressing potential harmful oxidative damage to proteins following oxidative stress. Using two different yeast prions, [PSI+]/Sup35 and [PIN+]/Rnq1, we will dissect the mechanism by which oxidative stress induces yeast prion formation de novo in both wild-type cells and mutants lacking the Tsa1/Tsa2 Prxs. We will use high-throughput assays for de novo formation of the [PSI+] and [PIN+] prions to establish whether prion formation is a common response to diverse oxidative stress conditions and extend that to other amyloid-forming human proteins such as alpha-synuclein. The functional interplay between Tsa1/Tsa2, the target prion proteins and their interactions with ribosomes will be investigated. This will enable us to define the ribosome-associated functions of the Prxs and determine whether protection against de novo prion formation occurs on ribosomes at the level of the nascent polypeptide chain. Our over-arching hypothesis is that the direct oxidation of Sup35 and Rnq1 leads to structural transitions favouring conversion to the transmissible amyloid-like form. We will therefore establish why a lack of Prx activity leads to the induction of de novo prion formation and establish whether this can be extrapolated to non-transmissible amyloids.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Sporadic Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease (CJD) accounts for over 80% of the verified cases of this fatal neurodegenerative disease in the UK, yet we know remarkably little about the underlying mechanism or triggers for disease development. The emergence of the disease correlates with the appearance of PrPSc, a novel conformational form of the cellular PrP protein. This entity, known as a prion, replicates through a novel cycle of seeded polymerisation and fragmentation, and it is assumed that certain genetic or environmental factors can trigger the conformational change in the absence of any pre-existing PrPSc 'seeds'. We have recently discovered an enzyme-mediated mechanism that prevents or suppresses oxidative damage to proteins in eukaryotes but also suppresses the de novo formation of the [PSI+] prion in yeast. [PSI+] is the prion form of the Sup35 protein and the antioxidant enzymes in question are the peroxiredoxins Tsa1 and Tsa2. The [PSI+] prion has been used widely as a model to demonstrate the protein-only nature of the prion propagation cycle and to identify some of the genetic and environmental factors that control the de novo formation of a prion. The major impact of our finding is clear: the accumulation of oxidative damage in certain proteins such as Sup35 can lead to the formation of a heritable amyloid-like form of the protein in the absence of any underlying genetic change. The same may also apply to the much more prevalent common 'protein misfolding' diseases that lead to dementia and death and which are increasing in proportion to the increased life span of the human, namely Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease and Parkinson's Disease. What will emerge from our study will be a detailed understanding of how oxidative damage acts as a trigger and the role cellular factors play in suppressing the potentially fatal consequences of such damage. The major impacts of this research nationally and internationally will therefore be on: (a) the bioscience research community with specific interests in the fields of protein synthesis and folding, (b) research aimed at identifying the causes of protein misfolding that lead to disease in humans and/or farmed animals, and (c) the biopharmaceutical sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>328876</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Christmas Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F856A04E-DCFB-4829-92D1-9C28C3E92358</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was attended by over 300 school students and teachers from Aberdeen and the surrounding region.

This involved 2-3 days per person per year visiting the School and participating in activities such as laboratory classes. This ongoing novel project involves years 12 and 13 school students carrying out research into multiple sclerosis by expressing myelin basic protein in yeast and characterising the purified protein (see www.mbp-squared.org). In 2012 the project was rolled out nationally, again with Wellcome Trust support and badged as the 'Authentic Biology' project that now engages some 1000 year 12 and 13 students a year in a variety of research projects across the UK (see www.authenticbiology.org). Naeimi acted as a technical aid and teacher, demonstrating techniques at workshops and providing project support.

The Authentic Biology has a national profile, has generated in excess of &amp;pound;500,000 funding from the Wellcome Trust and the project has and continues to receive wide coverage over the last three years from the local and national press, the scientific press (e.g. a Nature podcast; www.nature.com/nature/podcast/index-2013-11-21.html) and TV and radio interviews.

These elements are known as prions which are transmissible, self-perpetuating protein aggregates and whose inheritance can impact on the behaviour of the host receiving them. Prions are also associated with various neurodegenerative diseases in mammals but in this case they are detrimental to the host, often leading to loss of life. 

In collaboration with colleagues at the University of Manchester lead by Professor Chris Grant, we undertook to explore the molecular basis of how yeast prions form spontaneously into the diagnostic amyloid-like structures. The underlying events leading to prion formation are relatively poorly understood and our approach was to (a) establish environmental triggers of their de novo formation and (b) identify the role played by other cellular proteins in controlling the process.

In studying environmental triggers we focused on the hypothesis that oxidative stress acts as a general trigger for prion formation in yeast and possibly animal cells. Our data confirmed that indeed oxidative stress applied to yeast cells can trigger the formation of two different prions called [PSI+] and [PIN+] respectively. Furthermore impairment of the cellular factors used to combat damage imposed by oxidative stress, for example the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), resulted in elevated levels of prion formation. Our findings suggested that such functions can modulate the establishment of the prion state in yeast and, by inference, in animal cells. In parallel studies we also identified additional cellular factors that modulate prion formation and one of these, called Ppq1, is an enzyme that removes phosphates from various protein substrates - a so-called phosphatase. Our analysis of cells defective for the function of the Ppq1 enzyme indicated that there are other triggers of prion formation that are not related to oxidative stress and these will be pursued in future studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will be of interest to researchers (a) aiming to understand the sporadic formation of prion and other amyloid diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; (b) developing prospective therapeutic strategies for these devastating diseases of an ageing population, and (c) exploring the non-disease-associated functions of prions in regulating the form and function of fungal cells where they represent a unique example of epigenetics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B234FD86-E6DA-46C2-9167-F591986FD600</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/71CB1BBB-CD3B-404E-BB93-2690F08C4FA4"><gtr:id>71CB1BBB-CD3B-404E-BB93-2690F08C4FA4</gtr:id><gtr:title>The natural history of yeast prions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Advances in applied microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7ffb197bf5b900d9b559b919455ae0ec"><gtr:id>7ffb197bf5b900d9b559b919455ae0ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tuite MF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780124076730</gtr:isbn><gtr:issn>0065-2164</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7590676B-41CB-4B89-837B-BCDC000DD0C5"><gtr:id>7590676B-41CB-4B89-837B-BCDC000DD0C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>B07 Aggregation-prone Proteins Exacerbate Huntingtin Toxicity In Yeast And Drosophila</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp;
