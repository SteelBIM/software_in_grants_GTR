dissolved organic matter in freshwater ecosystems</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K010689/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Evidence indicating that nutrient flux to inland and coastal waters is increasing worldwide is clear. Despite significant management effort to reduce theses fluxes, while N &amp;amp; P concentrations have recently levelled off or decreased in some European catchments, in others an increase is reported, particularly in rivers draining through rapidly developing economic regions. A rising trend in Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) flux to freshwaters &amp;amp; coastal areas such as the Baltic Sea is also widely reported, particularly in the N Temperate &amp;amp; Boreal regions. Impacts on ecosystem health are extensive &amp;amp; undesirable in both freshwaters &amp;amp; coastal waters, &amp;amp; there are implications for human health where DOC &amp;amp; DON are also known to support carcinogen formation in water supplies.

In Europe the control of nutrient flux to all freshwaters &amp;amp; the coastal zone is required in order to meet the target of restoring waters to Good Ecological Status under the EU Water Framework Directive, while the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) is currently revising Annex IX of the Gothenburg Protocol (to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication &amp;amp; Ground-level Ozone) to further reduce the emission of ammonia from land-based activities.

Simultaneously, the UN has listed coastal nutrient pollution and hypoxia as the one of the greatest current threats to the global environment. Impacts include eutrophication of coastal waters and oxygen depletion, and the associated damage to ecosystems, biodiversity &amp;amp; coastal water quality. The UNEP Manila Declaration (Jan 2012) identifies nutrient enrichment of the marine environment as one of 3 foci for its Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities, and this was one of the key foci at the Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development, June 2012.

A detailed understanding of the nature, origins &amp;amp; rates of nutrient delivery to waters is essential if we are to control these impacts through management intervention, yet much of the necessary evidence base is lacking. Routine water quality monitoring is largely based on inorganic nutrient fractions, and substantially underestimates the total nutrient flux to waters, while research confirms that dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in ecosystem function including supporting microbial metabolism, primary production and pollutant transport, suggesting that its oversight in routine monitoring may undermine international efforts to bring nutrient enrichment impacts under control.

Here, we address this knowledge gap, building on the specific expertise of project members, undertaking a suite of interlinked experimental &amp;amp; observational research from molecular to catchment scale. We will use a combination of well-established approaches widely used in catchment research, with a range of cutting-edge approaches which are novel in their application to nutrient cycling research, or employ novel technologies, bringing new insights into the process controls on nutrient cycling at a molecular to river reach scale.

The programme will deliver improved understanding of:

1. the role of DOM in the transport of N &amp;amp; P from source to sea &amp;amp; the ways in which this might alter nutrient delivery to freshwaters &amp;amp; the coastal zone under a changing climate;
2. the ecological significance of DOM as a source of nutrient uptake &amp;amp; utilisation by algal, plant and microbial communities in waters of contrasting nutrient status &amp;amp; DOM character; and
3. the impacts of DOM flux from soils, livestock &amp;amp; human waste fluxes on the ecological status, goods &amp;amp; services provided by freshwaters.

It will also deliver knowledge exchange between the 5 groups &amp;amp; the wider science community, and have an impact beyond the lifetime of this project, building capacity through staff &amp;amp; PhD appointments in a field where current understanding is uncertain, undermining business planning and international policy development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact in the user community will be realised through the development of KE partnerships with those involved in policy and operational management of the environment. To this end, we have held a suite of meetings and discussion sessions with a wide range of stakeholders prior to finalising our proposal, in order to ensure that their interests and concerns are properly represented in the programme, and that the science we propose is transferable and useful beyond the immediate academic beneficiaries. 

Nine stakeholder organisations have agreed to join us as Project Partners, providing access to data and infrastructure assets, staff expertise, project placements and training. These include Government organisations (Defra, Environment Agency, Natural England, Countryside Council for Wales), charities (The Rivers Trust), and the water utilities including Wessex Water (Hampshire Avon), Welsh Water (Conwy) and Scottish Water who have significant problems with DBP formation in a number of their water supply catchments.

We will also develop a number of novel technologies, including the testing of novel sensor technologies to capture high resolution information on CDOM flux at catchment scale, and the development of a novel proteomic/metabolomics approaches to allow holistic study of the metabolic processes controlling nutrient utilisation by microbial communities, and characterisation of the enzymatic functions involved. The group at Bangor is world-leading in this field, and we have secured a letter of support from Dr Ferrer, Institute of Catalysis, Madrid confirming his support for and involvement in the application of this technology to this project as a Project Partner. 

We will deliver KE through a 5 step process:

1. all Project Partners have participated in the final formulation of this bid, providing valuable suggestions to hone the programme to ensure that anticipated outcomes meet their interests and operational needs; they will join the Project Board, establish a programme of placements and working partnerships with staff and PhD students, and participate in a start-up workshop to refine the proposed sampling programme, to ensure that this capitalises on their existing data, infrastructure assets and focus areas;
2. we will produce a series of briefing notes on specific policy implications of our research findings for our Project Partner organisations throughout the programme making these publicly available through our project website and the publicity activities of our Project Partner organisations;
3. we will develop links with the wider stakeholder community through the project website and existing KT networks in which we are already involved in our Hampshire Avon and Conwy research, and will ensure wider public engagement through University Science Days and local and national media; 
4. we will engage with the wider academic community through: (i) free weekly access for external researchers to our high frequency quantitative data; (ii) publication of 10 core papers in international peer reviewed journals, a suite of integrative papers in a special issue of Global Biogeochemical Cycles, and an overarching paper in Nature on the 'Environmental Role and Significance of DOM Flux in Freshwaters'; (iii) feedback on our findings to the international policy arena through our participation as expert members of the IPCC, UNECE Task Force for Reactive N and UNEP Foresight programmes, (iv) presentation of our findings at international conferences, and (iv) a contribution to Planet Earth;

Indeed, this has already been taken up by one of our Project Partners, Wessex Water, feeding directly into their monitoring and catchment management approaches which have now been modified to include measurement of the total N and P concentrations in water samples from their sites and operations, rather than just the inorganic nutrient fractions. This will generate more effective catchment management and planning. In addition the findings from DOMAINE have been fed into briefings of the OECD Environment Ministers in Paris, Autumn 2016 at their Environment Ministerial Conference, where Professor Johnes was invited to provide a briefing on Nitrogen. Attendees reported a change of attitude and broadened understanding of the nature and scale of N enrichment of waters, globally, of projected increasing trends in relation to population and economic growth, and of the role of DOM in the transport and ecological impact of N in inland and coastal waters.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6713A6C6-F023-4EFA-8A73-B1A9E290DE4A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>WP1: By the end of September 2016, under WP1 all six automated sampling sites had been up and running for 21 months in the Hampshire Avon catchment and for 18 months in the Conwy catchment. This had generated a detailed daily record of N speciation, P fractions and DOC concentrations at each of our instrumented sites, relative to hydrometeorological conditions, stream discharge, pH, temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, turbidity and fluorescence spectroscopy measured at 30 minute resolution at each of these 6 sites. These records were supplemented with a weekly measurement of DOM fluorescence and UV-Visible absorbance on samples returned to the lab weekly from each site. In addition, a suite of weekly samples had been collected over a 12 month period at a further 43 sampling locations across the two catchments linked to key contributing sources in each system, with a subset of these samples has been passed on to WP2 for molecular scale characterisation. This comprised the Tier 1 monitoring programme for WP1. Daily monitoring ceased at these sites on 30/09/16, while weekly monitoring was continued at a subset of sites to 31/12/16 in order to ensure that data streams were maintained until the completion of WP3 and WP4 Tier 1 experiments. A full analysis of these data sets is currently nearing completion, and a pair of publications is in preparation, linking the nutrient fractionation and inferred DOM composition to landscape and geoclimatic character across all sites. This has identified strong relationships between environmental character, source types and connectivity, the speciation of the total N and total P load, and spectroscopically inferred DOM character along environmental gradients from source to sea.

From the beginning of October we have set up our storm sampling programme, with the automatic water samplers set to trigger automatically in response to a sharp change in any one of the sensor data streams which are fully telemetered for all 6 sites. We are in the middle of a phase of storm event sampling at present, aimed at capturing the episodic connection and flushing of accumulated DOM pools within the landscape to each stream sampling location. Several events have been sampled to date, with a subset of samples collected over the course of each event for WP2. This has involved manual sampling in glass bottles capped with foil, to avoid any contamination of the samples prior to molecular scale analysis. The telemetered sensor data are displayed in real time on our project website, and have been accessed by a number of local stakeholder groups as well as other research teams working in these catchments under allied programmes. 

Rainwater sample collection is still ongoing under WP1 with three sites instrumented per catchment. Both quantitative and molecular scale characterisation is planned for these samples, to allow us to distinguish the DOM fingerprint of atmospheric deposition in each catchment. We are now in the process of planning our final set of monitoring campaigns in WP1 to include diurnal sampling in association with WP4 staff, during the summer months, sampling of comparable systems in our Tier 2 catchments to allow upscaling of our findings to comparable landscape types, and a suite of reach-scale nutrient addition experiments using dual-labelled 13C15N DOM isotopes, in order to trace the transport and uptake pathways for DOM compounds of differing character under environmental conditions. This work will involve staff and students from all 4 WP working together to deliver an integrated understanding of the role of DOM in stream ecosystems.

WP2 has adopted a multi-level approach, and has recently completed a major phase of method development. Several wholly novel methods for untargeted molecular characterisation of DON and DOP using high resolution mass spectrometry have now been developed, allowing wider exploration of the molecular composition of DOM from the
range of samples and environmental conditions collected in the WP1 Tier 1 programme. This subset of samples from contrasting sources, seasons and sites, to which we are adding samples from storm events currently being sampled, have been freeze dried ready for analysis in WP2. With the methods now developed, we are making steady progress
in working our way through the archive, while the novel protocols are currently being written up for publication in a high impact factor journal. Elsewhere in WP2 we have developed a workflow for analysing direct infusion mass spectrometry data using statistical approaches to identify the analytes of interest, and discriminate between sites and sources based on their molecular scale organic chemistry signatures. Our novel method developed for organic phosphorus characterisation using ion chromatography to separate a key compound, phytic acid, from complex environmental matrices followed by analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry is about to be submitted for
publication. Finally, we are investigating the specificity of the well-used, but poorly understood automated urea detection method in place on our Skalar instrument. A range of nitrogenous compounds have been tested using this method, with reactivity with heterocyclic compounds and both purine and pyrimidine derivatives noted in our early work. This suggests that interpretation of analytical data generated from this method need to proceed with care: the method is not only detecting the concentration of urea, but of a range of compounds that react colourimetrically in the same manner, using this method. Once completed this work, too, will be written up for publication, with the clarified method used to support a range of soil and manure-based incubation experiments in one of our programme PhD studentships.

Early findings from WP1 and WP2 to date and from linked work undertaken by members of WP3 suggest the importance of higher molecular weight (HMW) compounds in the flux from peaty catchments, the degradation and/or dissolution of peatland DOC along the length of the Conwy and the appearance of a discrete set of DOM compounds which appear only in waters draining from the peat. A second set of low molecular weight DOM compounds present in the Hampshire Avon appear at this stage to be linked to the delivery of animal waste from livestock production and effluent discharges to the river. Further analysis currently underway is allowing us to determine the nature of this material in WP2. Findings from WP1 (where we measure urea directly at daily frequency) confirm the importance of urea (or urea-like substances) from livestock and sewage waste sources in waters draining from lowland and agricultural catchments, and the unusually low C:N ratios in these systems. A publication including some of these data for the Hampshire Avon has now been published (Yates et al. 2016). A second paper on DOM qualitative indicators, based on analysis of the fluorescence and UV-visible
spectrophotometry is under development, following completion of the full tier 1 dataset from WP1.

WP3 is progressing well with the manuscript &amp;quot;Microbial use of low molecular weight DOM in filtered and unfiltered freshwater: Role of ultra-small microorganisms and implications for water quality monitoring&amp;quot; now under review with Science of the Total Environment. Our second main experiment looking at seasonal variation in microbial processing of low molecular weight solutes (14C-labelled amino acids, glucose, glucose-6-phosphate and inorganic 33P-labelled orthophosphoric acid) has now been completed for both catchments. This experiment involved monitoring the of DOC, DON and DOP degradation in 47 different riverine locations, which cover a wide range of land use and habitat types over a full annual cycle. Degradation kinetics is currently being used to identify seasonal trends in the rates of microbial processing of C, N and P relative to site character, and a paper exploring these trends in the context of the nutrient fractionation data from WP1 is in progress. A third experiment looking at the concentration kinetics of four different chemical functional groups (14C-labelled sugars, organic acids, amino acids,phenolics) in both river water and sediment for six rivers in two contrasting land use types in the Conwy catchment (lowland improved grassland and upland blanket peat bog) has now been completed. A second paper examining the degradation kinetics in both sediment and water is also in progress, while a review on the evolution and functional role of ultra-small microorganisms is also close to completion. In terms of presentation of our work to external audiences, on 07/02/17 results from the paper exploring the &amp;quot;role of ultra-small microorganisms in freshwater ecosystems&amp;quot; were presented at the Environment Centre Wales monthly seminar series.

Evaluation of the data generated from the metabolic profiling of water and sediment samples sent to our Project Partner in Madrid is currently paused as we await further data from this partner. There has been slow progress on this element of the programme, so we have entered this as a separate row in Table 1, with an amber classification,
to indicate that we have this under close scrutiny. We hope to report positive progress with this element of the programme in our next report.

WP4 has made substantial progress towards addressing the hypotheses posed in Objective 4 of the Case for Support. We have now completed one full year of inorganic and organic nutrient bioassay experiments across six sites within the Tier 1 catchments at approximately bi-monthly frequency. These sites represent a gradient of organic and
inorganic nutrient concentrations. Growth responses by phytoplankton and epilithic communities at each site have been examined in relation to eight different organic N and P compounds, which differ in terms of molecular weight and lability. Initial results suggest that the majority of the organic nutrient compounds tested are readily utilised by
the phytoplankton community, although the response for the epilithic algae is less clear. There appear to be distinct patterns in organic nutrient use across sites, with inorganic bioassays confirming that, on average, the majority of sites are phosphorus limited, with the more upland sites being co-limited by phosphorus and nitrogen. Seasonal
patterns in organic nutrient use and the extent of nutrient limitation are also apparent at some sites and the cause of this requires further investigation. To address the hypothesis in Objective 4b we have also carried out organic nutrient bioassays on rooted and unrooted macrophytes. Samples of a common moss and Ranunculus species were
taken from one site in each of the Tier 1 catchments. Their biomass, growth rate and cellular nutrient content have been assessed following a one month incubation period with the same nutrient treatments as for the algae. Initial results from this work indicate that mass and relative growth rate increased more for the unrooted than rooted
macrophyte species tested in the different organic nutrient treatments. A new NERC funded PhD studentship (via the NERC GW4 DTP) started at Bristol in October 2016. Supervised between Bristol and CEH, the project will investigate controls on organic nutrient use by algae and macrophyte species using an experimental approach
including single species cultures. This will provide valuable additional information to inform this part of the project, and the studentship has therefore been formally aligned with the NERC DOMAINE programme to ensure that opportunities for synergies are identified. A publication based on the first completed year of bioassay experiments is
currently under development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These are the initial findings need to be calibrated against conditions in a wider range of catchments in order to confirm their validity and generate generic knowledge that is transferable between systems and scales.

These findings have relevance to policy makers and practitioners engaged in the management and control of nutrient enrichment impacts on stream ecology in UK catchments.

The patterns observed in UK lowland catchments are quite distinct from those observed in forested and semi-natural vegetated catchments across the conterminous USA, and in the boreal region of Scandinavia, and confirm the unique DOM chemistry of highly perturbed systems such as those found in the UK. 

Within the UK, the findings across our combined work package activity could be used to inform the revision of existing routine nutrient monitoring programmes which are not currently fit for purpose.

One outcome from this role drawing directly on evidence generated from the DOMAINE programme on the quantitative significance of Dissolved Organic Matter (DOM) in freshwater nutrient flux, has been a change in analytical practice for samples collected from Wessex Water sites and assets.
