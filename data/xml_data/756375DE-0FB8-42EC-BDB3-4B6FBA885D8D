&lt;p>The study builds upon previous research with headteachers, education professionals, and children in an English Local Authority.&amp;nbsp; It will employ mixed methods, beginning with a questionnaire survey of parents with children attending primary schools in higher, middle and lower income areas.&amp;nbsp; The results of this will inform interviews with 45 parents from different socio-economic backgrounds exploring: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>their family activity patterns; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>their views on school as a potential source of childcare; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the value they place on structured activities in enriching children's lives; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>their opinions about schools' potential to provide parenting support.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The findings will inform Extended Services policy development through partnership with local and national Government and charities, and contribute to academic debates about the changing role of schools in society.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy report about parents' attitudes to parenting classes run through primary schools</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC6DBA1D-C57D-406C-B72D-809BE09A135F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Policy report - Who wants parenting classes and why? : the primary years press released and circulated to key policy makers.

? School-based Breakfast and After Schools Clubs are important sources of wraparound care for primary-aged children. Breakfast clubs are particularly important in low income areas; after school clubs are more significant in higher income areas. 
? Both enjoy very high levels of parental support for their role in helping working families.
? In a context where successive Governments have championed work as the route out of poverty, the lower rates of after school club provision, and use, in middle and low income areas of is cause for concern.
? More muted parental support also exists for the provision of breakfast clubs to ensure low income children eat well before school.

Enrichment activities
? Children in higher income areas have much greater access to enrichment activities than their middle and low income counterparts.
? School-based provision is important as it ameliorates some of these income inequalities.
? There is, nevertheless, still unmet demand for enrichment activities in low income areas. By contrast, in higher income areas elevated rates of use have led to concerns that some children do too many activities, and some parents struggle to cope with fitting their children's activities into their own working week.
? Cuts in school-based enrichment activities would hit children in middle and low income areas the hardest, and would widen inequality.

Parental support 
? Demand for parental support activities in schools is highest in low income areas, followed by middle income areas.
? Engaging 'hard to reach' parents may not be easy, but primary schools are a very good place to start. Access to services such as parenting classes, basic skills, social workers etc. can be hampered by practical and emotional concerns. However, parents trust schools, which are physically accessible and socially familiar to them, more than other potential service hubs.
? In higher income areas, demand for parental support is generally more limited.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Wrap around childcare
? The study raises the importance of affordable childcare for families with primary school aged children.
? It illustrates the importance of schools as site for accessible, respected and cost-effective provision.

Enrichment activities
? The study acts as a base for researchers investigating social exclusion in access to cultural and educational capital through out-of-school activities.

Parenting education
? The benchmarks the degree to which parents from different social class backgrounds are willing to engage with parenting education.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9EC15F97-D10F-47C1-BA4B-84D9F1E4E9BD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Co-production of good practice guide with practioners: Closing the gap - examples of good practice with children, families and communities in Hortonshire schools</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB9B5992-F49A-49C0-A2E4-D8552A377934</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Extended Services Networking Event (see engagement for further details)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82C72454-AD65-4280-8D76-33FFFB6FFB56</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/758E8240-AC03-484C-B9D9-0B83BEBE43C5"><gtr:id>758E8240-AC03-484C-B9D9-0B83BEBE43C5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Parental involvement in children's learning: Mothers' fourth shift, social class, and the growth of state intervention in family life</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Canadian Geographer / Le G?ographe canadien</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c81998f7ae0cdec5d102f5d6b771ac24"><gtr:id>c81998f7ae0cdec5d102f5d6b771ac24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holloway S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/36E102B7-EBC9-43DA-9231-470C624EC8D1"><gtr:id>36E102B7-EBC9-43DA-9231-470C624EC8D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Changing children's geographies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Children's Geographies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c81998f7ae0cdec5d102f5d6b771ac24"><gtr:id>c81998f7ae0cdec5d102f5d6b771ac24</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Holloway S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D9F0F2D8-0CF9-4E56-8950-04003775F467"><gtr:id>D9F0F2D8-0CF9-4E56-8950-04003775F467</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enriching Children, Institutionalizing Childhood?
