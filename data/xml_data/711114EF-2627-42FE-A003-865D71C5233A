&lt;p>The main aim is to provide a detailed account of the experiences of these prisoners, focussing on three main areas:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>how they cope with (and develop during) such long sentences, and how they manage issues of self and identity&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how they adapt socially to imprisonment, in particular, their relationships with staff and other prisoners, and their levels of compliance, engagement and resistance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>how their sentence conditions and lives prior to imprisonment shape their perceptions of penal legitimacy. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The research will contribute to policy and practice in a range of areas, for example, by better informing relevant policymakers and practitioners about the consequences of new sentencing practices, about the needs of this group of very long-term prisoners, and about the operational challenges resulting from the growing number of prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the proposals in the 2010 Green Paper in relation to sentencing for serious offences, and building on legislation over the last decade, there are likely to be a growing number of prisoners serving very long sentences from a relatively early age. As suggested in the recent expression of operational concerns about this prisoner group (see Case for Support), the research would have significant implications for practitioners, policymakers and organisations concerned with the sentencing, management and wellbeing of young offenders and life sentenced prisoners. Potential beneficiaries of the research would include sentencers and policymakers, senior practitioners within the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), a range of prison staff (within the high-security prison estate, but also in lower-security prisons), third sector organisations, pressure groups and organisations such as Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons.

These organisations would be interested in a range of potential findings: what are the institutional risks of incarcerating young adults for very long periods i.e. what are the outcomes and implications for institutional stability, violence, staff safety, prisoner radicalisation, and gang-related activity within prisons? Given that NOMS remains committed to treating all prisoners with decency and respect, how can it put in place measures that might make the lives of young adults sentenced for very long periods meaningful as well as survivable? How can staff be trained to deal with the particular needs of this prisoner group, and prepare them for eventual release? To what degree might sentencing practices and prisoner treatment be counter-productive, or potentially in conflict with legal requirements that punishment should not constitute 'inhuman and degrading treatment'? Do these sentences appear to serve any deterrent effect, in terms of how they are understood within the communities from which these prisoners come? How do the terms of these sentences reflect and reproduce structures of inequality outside prison? These and other such questions require empirical exploration. 

Prisoners would constitute a key group of research beneficiaries, and the proposed research would have many implications for their wellbeing and quality of life, and that of their families. What ensures that long-term prisoners are able to retain hope and meaning? What can be done to prevent unnecessary levels of distress among these prisoners? How might their 'generativity' - their desire to 'give something back' to the community or to future generations - be harnessed while they are in prison? What might motivate them to engage positively with prison staff in ways that will benefit them, their families, and their victims, as well as the prison system?

In the medium- to long-term, the research could make an important contribution to the quality, humanity, purpose and effectiveness of prisons, and therefore to the quality of life and welfare of prisoners and staff working within a variety of prison settings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>248232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>contribution of factual material to lawyers acting in the Supreme Court</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>48E070BA-B1A3-4E4F-94C0-BD71C76FA3A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not yet clear

In October 2015, we were also asked to contribute evidence which was submitted by a team of lawyers challenging the use of Joint Enterprise in the Supreme Court.

Findings have also been reported at the European Society of Criminology conference 2014 and 2015, at seminars at the University of Southampton and the University of Birmingham, as well as the Prison Research Centre's annual research day, whose attendees included the Chief Executive of the National Offender Management Service and the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, as well as other senior practitioners. The chief executive of the National Offender Management Service has commented that our findings will be more significant in shaping their treatment of long-term prisoners than any other ongoing research, and further discussion of the implications of our findings was undertaken with a team of Prison Service psychologists leading work in this area in November 2015. In February 2016, the findings will also be reported to a specially convened meeting of Ministry of Justice policymakers. 

In September 2015, the PI presented the findings from the study to an audience of 300 practitioners working in prisons and probation, as part of the Butler Trust's 30 year anniversary event. In October 2015, the PI presented the findings to 200 senior practitioners working for the Scottish Prison Service. 

Direct feedback of the study's results has been undertaken with prisoners in seven of the establishments in which the fieldwork was undertaken, to around 90 prisoners overall. The PI is also due to present the study's findings to the senior management team of one of the fieldwork sites in November 2015. Other feedback activity includes the reporting of findings to the Institute of Criminology's MSt students (criminal justice practitioners undertaking a part-time Masters course in Applied Criminology, Penology and Management).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5FE2EE23-B652-4548-B06F-ACEF4CC1B5A9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The basic and emerging findings thus far can be summarised as follows:

1. Our survey data give a clear indication of the problems of long-term imprisonment which are experienced as most and least severe by prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age. Those that are most severe relate primarily to missing others outside prison and feeling that one's life is being lost or wasted; those experienced as least severe are emotional/psychological (e.g. relating to fears about mental health and psychological integrity). 

2. The survey data also show that early-phase prisoners generally experience the problems of confinement as being more severe than those further into their sentences. Few of these differences are statistically significant, but there is a clear general pattern of diminishing severity by stage of sentence. 

The qualitative data suggest that this is because long-term prisoners, following an initial period of 'entry shock' and 'temporal vertigo', in which adaptive patterns generally involve forms of psychological denial or 'retreatism', reflect on their predicament (and the offences they have committed) and seek to establish new identities and forms of existential meaning. Likewise, they establish strategies for managing time (both the 'endless present' and the distant future) and gaining localised forms of control over their lives, which enable them to psychologically survive their extreme predicament. 

3. Most prisoners feel themselves to be 'maturing' during their sentence in certain respects (e.g. anger management; tolerance of others). However, this experience of maturation stands in contrast with the experience of time 'out there', or 'social time', having stopped at the point of the sentence. 

4. The fact that problem severity does not seem to increase by sentence stage has been interpreted in previous studies as evidence that long-term imprisonment does not have cumulative or deleterious effects. Based on our interview data, our interpretation is instead that long-term prisoners become 'over-adapted' to their environment, so that their core selves are fundamentally altered by the imperatives of their predicament, in ways that may be maladaptive for life after-release.

5. The differences between the experiences of male and female prisoners serving very long sentences from an early age are significant, with female prisoners reporting consistently higher problem severity.

5. In terms of social adaptations, the survey results show that late-stage prisoners are less loyal to other prisoners, less hostile to staff, and less committed to an 'inmate code' than those in earlier sentence stages. This is theoretically significant, since it would normally be expected that prisoners would become more socialised into an inmate culture as time proceeds, or would be most committed in the mid-phase of the sentence.

6. Despite very common feelings of injustice and resentment among interviewees about their convictions or sentence lengths, most were highly compliant with their sentence. Most were resigned to their predicament, and to the 'risks of resistance', and few held the prison or its staff responsible for their general predicament. That is, they differentiated between the wider criminal justice system and the prison system specifically.

Overall, these findings represent a very significant addition to our understanding of the experiences and adaptations of very long-term prisoners. In highlighting the importance of time, age, shame and self-identity in the experience of long-term imprisonment, they are suggestive of a number of areas for further research. The study has also generated an original research tool - a survey on the problems of long-term imprisonment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have clear implications for practitioners in relation to the management of long-term prisoners, their wellbeing, compliance and post-release outcomes, the role of faith and other spiritual practices in prisons, and the systemic impact of imprisoning greater numbers of men and women for longer periods. It is relevant to current debates about life sentences, including the use of the Joint Enterprise doctrine.

The research also raises further questions about long-term imprisonment, which we wish to explore in future research. In particular, we hope to examine:

1. The relationships between prisoners serving very long life sentences from an early age and their family members/ 'significant others' 
2. The experiences of prisoners serving very long life sentences from late middle age
3. The experiences of patients serving very long life sentences from an early age who have been transferred during their sentences from prisons to secure psychiatric facilities

Together, these sub-studies would enable us to examine the differential experiences of long-term confinement according to age when sentenced and institutional location, and the role of external relational support in shaping the prisoner experience. They would also help us understand the experiences and adaptations of the family members/ significant others of long-term lifers outside the prison. This would greatly expand our understanding of adaptations to long-term confinement.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>964E7D87-7B87-46D7-B328-312A91ED476E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/research/ltp_from_young_adulthood/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>WRITTEN AND VERBAL EVIDENCE TO JUSTICE COMMITTEE'S INQUIRY ON JOINT ENTERPRISE</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>99399ED3-3F04-42FB-853E-B8A5C27F161A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO REVIEW OF THE LAW.
