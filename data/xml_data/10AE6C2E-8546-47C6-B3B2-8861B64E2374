The next-generation of protein-based therapies, or biopharmaceuticals, are of increasingly complex engineered forms, with unpredictable solution properties. Proteins are formulated at high concentrations for clinical use, leading often to undesirable aggregate formation, high viscosity, opalescence, or phase separation, rendering them unsafe, or difficult to inject or manufacture. This is a major challenge to the biopharmaceuticals industry as approximately 50% of proteins in clinical trials have been freeze-dried as they were not readily liquid-formulated on timescales of months required during development. Formulation is an empirical process using combinatorial screens that aim to optimise stability, potency and ease of delivery to patients. Engagement with 36 industry leaders at a UCL EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing workshop identified the most significant protein formulation challenges such as the prediction of shelf stability over a two year period, at a time in development when not much material is available. Current surrogate techniques that accelerate protein degradation and minimize sample consumption provide poor indicators of 2-year shelf-life. Industry would benefit significantly from i) rapid analyses that more accurately determine long-term shelf-life, ii) low concentration analyses that indicate high-concentration solution behaviour, and iii) a better ability to use calculated protein and excipient properties to predict those formulations that are most likely to meet the required attributes.

State-of-the-art automated microplate and microfluidic analytics, purchased or established recently via EPSRC and BBSRC/BRIC awards at UCL and UoM provide a timely platform for generating large experimental datasets of aggregation kinetics spanning many different timescales, conformational and colloidal stabilities, rheological properties, phase-transition and glass transition temperatures, for liquid and freeze-dried formulations. A recent EPSRC funded &amp;pound;500k pilot-scale freeze-drying facility at UCL (EP/M028100/1), combined with DoE and 3D process simulations, will generate freeze-drying process models that elucidate the mechanisms linking critical process parameters to critical quality attributes for new formulations. Novel dipeptides emerging from recent UoM work will significantly expand the range of industry-accepted formulation excipients available. Novel microfluidic analytics will be tailored for formulation needs, bringing earlier, more sensitive, and lower-volume assessments of formulated protein heterogeneity and storage kinetics, ultimately in a high-throughput format using sealed microwells.

All data will populate a web-access database at UoM to provide modeling groups access to a much-needed experimental dataset. Informatics techniques initiated at UoM in a BioProNet PoC award will enable new proteins to be compared (via properties calculated from sequence and structure) to those in the database, and use their experimentally determined formulation behaviours in a predictive manner. Correlations between calculated protein properties and critical formulation attributes will identify the molecular basis of excipient behaviour. 

Overall, this will benefit the biopharmaceutical formulation community with an ability to: a) identify better excipient combinations for input into formulation screens; b) predict those protein candidates most readily formulatable with current excipients and solution conditions; c) inform the rational design of novel peptide-based excipients through defined chemical modifications, d) predict long-term storage stability and concentrated solution behaviour from accessible experiments using minimal sample.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-07-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>861317</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A key stumbling block to predicting solubility or aggregation propensity is the lack of comprehensive database relating behaviour to structure along with a suite of tools/algorithms for mining the data and testing predictions. Towards this end, we have developed a publicly accessible web server that uses our in-house and freely available software and algorithms for solubility prediction, in a user-friendly graphics window. The software is used to calculate a variety of different properties from protein amino acid sequence and/or protein structural data. Properties calculated for sequences include: amino acid compositions; combinations of charges to give net predicted charge, fraction charged, predicted isoelectic point, ratio of conservative amino acids; propensity for disorder; and ?-strand/sheet forming propensity. These properties are calculated as averages over the entire sequence and as minimal/maximal values in windows of 21 and 51 amino acids along the sequence. For structures and structural models, properties calculated include: patch non-polarity, calculated as non-polar solvent accessible surface area (SASA) divided by polar SASA, size distribution of charged patches (positive and negative, including the largest patches) from Finite Difference Poisson Boltzmann (FDPB) calculations; average contact order for heavy atoms in the protein, relating to the degree of close packing as an empirical proxy for structural stability. Charge patches are dependent on ionic strength and pH, features that are also part of FDPB calculations, which allows us to account for ionic strength and/or pH effects on solubility. The philosophy of our website is to make all software available both to use online, and as downloadable code for in-house use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>91586719-A1E9-492D-B49A-7E44751033F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A publicly available database for solubility prediction of biopharmaceuticals</gtr:title><gtr:type>Antibody</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.protein-sol.manchester.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N024796/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9C387DA5-CD5F-43E4-AA74-82CBF4DB6617</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioprocess Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B30DC286-3309-48E2-A15D-BDF547057A33</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drug Formulation &amp; Delivery</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
