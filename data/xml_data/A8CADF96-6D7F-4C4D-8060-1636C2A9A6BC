Stakeholder meeting held at Rothamsted October 2014
Disciplines involved are STRI - Dr Ben Turner is Director of the Soils Department at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) in Panama. He is widely acknowledged as being one of the leading world experts in the field of soil and water phosphorus cycling, with particular expertise in organic phosphorus and its measurement. He has expertise in the measurement of organic phosphorus in waters and soil extracts using 31P-NMR and enzyme hydrolysis techniques, and has been fundamental in the development of these methods over the past 10 years. Ms Dayana Agudo is the laboratory superintendent of the STRI soils laboratory, and an expert in a wide range of techniques in phosphorus analysis, including enzyme hydrolysis and 31P-NMR sample preparation. Ms Alex Bielnicka is a research chemist with expertise in all aspects of phosphorus analysis. 
Rothamsted Research - Dr Martin Blackwell is PI on the BBSRC organic phosphorus project (BB/K018795/1) with Lancaster University, and is leading studies within Rothamsted which are utilising 31P-NMR and d18O-PO4 stable isotope techniques. Prof Steve McGrath is a PI on Rothamsted's Institute Strategic Programme (ISP) on Delivering Sustainable Systems, and leads the workpackage on &amp;quot;Optimisation of nutrients in soil-plant systems - Determining how phosphorus availability is regulated in soils&amp;quot; (BBS/E/C/00005197), which involves all the Rothamsted staff mentioned in this proposal. Dr Steve Granger is an early career scientist with expertise in the use and application of the d18O-PO4 stable isotope technique for the tracing of phosphate sources and is currently developing this methodology as a tool for indicating enzymatic processes in plants. Dr Jane Hawkins has expertise in the use of HPLC techniques for the analysis of organic compounds, and will work with Prof Haygarth and the postdoc appointed on the new BBSRC project at Lancaster University on the development of this method for measuring organic phosphorus compounds in solution. 
Lancaster University - Prof Phil Haygarth is an expert on soils and their interactions with connected water-bodies, from catchment to coast and plant to planet. He is lead PI on the BBSRC organic phosphorus project (BB/K018795/1) and currently the President of the British Society of Soil Science. Prof Hao Zhang has expertise in advanced environmental analytical techniques, and developed the DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin Films) method for measuring elements and compounds in soils. Dr Ben Surridge has expertise in the use of d18O-PO4 isotope tracers to investigate biological and geochemical controls on phosphorus cycling within freshwater.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Host a workshop at Smithonian Research Centre comprising delegates from all three institutes to

However, phosphorus is nearly always associated with oxygen (phosphate) in the natural environment and oxygen does have different stable isotopes. Therefore we can use these isotopes to both trace phosphate in different systems and identify types and rates of processes occurring in soils, plants and water.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E77EC5C6-E37B-4392-8D76-41EAA6C760D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method is still very much under development, but we have used it to trace sources of phosphate in surface waters and secure funding from Natural England and the Westcountry Rivers Trust.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Using stable isotopes of oxygen in phosphate to trace sources of phosphorus and cycling processes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/601079C0-AAC8-4FF3-9792-B34B9FBD83E1"><gtr:id>601079C0-AAC8-4FF3-9792-B34B9FBD83E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>SCOPE Newsletter (European Sustainable Phosphorus Platform)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5f52f20dda590fbcc23f3762d66d382"><gtr:id>b5f52f20dda590fbcc23f3762d66d382</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McGrath, S.P.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/272004B7-44DB-4D62-9AA5-EE663A7307C7"><gtr:id>272004B7-44DB-4D62-9AA5-EE663A7307C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Assessment of bioavailable organic phosphorus in tropical forest soils by organic acid extraction and phosphatase hydrolysis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geoderma</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a1029b5cce88918419daf536bea64dc4"><gtr:id>a1029b5cce88918419daf536bea64dc4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Darch T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-7061</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AC739663-F08B-4023-9BAB-077145155E6F"><gtr:id>AC739663-F08B-4023-9BAB-077145155E6F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Phosphate stable oxygen isotope variability within a temperate agricultural soil.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Geoderma</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5caaca3603a3fbe17c11de10323bc36"><gtr:id>b5caaca3603a3fbe17c11de10323bc36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Granger SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0016-7061</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1D1CDDA1-E9C4-4495-9EB0-07C612C6248F"><gtr:id>1D1CDDA1-E9C4-4495-9EB0-07C612C6248F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The oxygen isotopic composition of phosphate in river water and its potential sources in the Upper River Taw catchment, UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Science of the total environment</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5caaca3603a3fbe17c11de10323bc36"><gtr:id>b5caaca3603a3fbe17c11de10323bc36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Granger SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0048-9697</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L026309/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
