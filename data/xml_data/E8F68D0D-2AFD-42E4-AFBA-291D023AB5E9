is to use creative arts to negotiate and challenge images of ageing and explore their contribution to participatory approaches to research in social gerontology. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The initiative will bring together researchers from gerontology and art therapy with a cultural development agency that uses the transformative power of the arts to make a difference to people and places.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three different blocks of workshops will be run with a range of older women who will be invited to explore media and cultural representations of older women and use videographic and photographic techniques to create their own images of ageing. The exact format of the workshops will be negotiated with participants. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Exhibitions of representations, produced during the projects and released with participants' agreement, will follow from the workshops. The invited audiences to the exhibitions (including participants, policy-makers, local politicians, older people's organisations, as well as members of the public) will have the opportunity to give their responses to the images via talking head videos. Alongside the talking head videos, the initiative will be documented and evaluated using observation, interviews, short questionnaires, self-reflective diaries, video diaries and sketch-books. A website and DVD of the initiative will also be produced. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>291991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The curated exhibition, entitles Look At Me! Images of Women and Ageing - presented 63 images, as artwork (fine art, sculpture, photography) and as electronic installation, with accompanying text, photo-diary and film documentation. Participants were consulted about which of the images they wanted to be displayed and how. To maximise exposure, it was held at a diverse range of venues: gallery space in the cultural quarter of Sheffield, city centre shop windows, and a new university exhibition space. Audiences included: participants and their family/friends; local politicians and policy makers; older people's organisations; and members of the public. Exhibition visitors participated in generating new narratives of ageing by recording their responses via questionnaire or to camera.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3148AC40-0525-41C4-B219-B870D0DF9AA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition has been held at venues UK-wide:
*Project-led: Sheffield- Workstation (9 March-23 March 2011), The Moor shop windows (26 March-7 April 2011), Jessop West (11-15 April 2011), Interdisciplinary Centre of the Social Sciences (July 2011 and May 2013); Derby University (2013).
*Invited: Royal College of Art (18-20 April 2011); University of Plymouth (5-7 July 2011); City Screen, York (28 Sept-11 Oct 2012); Live Age Festival, Stoke on Trent (1-3 October 2015).
Recorded visitors: Workstation and Jessop West - 416. Footfall: The Moor - 14,447 (average daily); City Screen - 1,918.
Findings from the exhibition questionnaires (n242) showed that 87% of visitors found the exhibition either 'good' or 'very good'; 83% found it 'thought-provoking' and 88% of visitors said they would like to see more images of older women displayed in public. 

In addition to being used as book covers, images are on permanent display by organisations including Sheffield Age UK and Swansea University's Centre for Innovative Ageing. Images at the latter formed part of an arts-based Coming of Age Trail in Swansea set up by Arts &amp;amp; Health Co-ordinator Prue Thimberley (1 May-21 June 2013): footfall- estimated 30,000 for the entire trail.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Look At Me!

Colleagues from the Centre said the following about the images:
'The ladies in the pictures really do catch the eye in the space they reside. They are colourful, vibrant and thought-provoking...They can open one's eyes to the fact that ageing can be much more than that of the stereotypical older person, a person's self identity can still sparkle through in bucket loads' (Amy Jenkins - CFAS South Wales Site Coordinator)



&amp;quot;At our Centre (for Innovative Ageing, Swansea University) the whole team agreed that a gallery of portraits of older people in our corridors would be an excellent idea. Firstly it is the opportunity to put our group identity and understanding of what it can mean to be older on public display. Secondly and importantly, we wanted to challenge the all too common stereotypes of older people being frail or needy. We find that many such images (which are in the public domain) patronising. Alarmingly, images like these are often used by organisations and bodies actually working with or for older people. The series of colour portraits from the University of Sheffield's Look at me! project met our search criteria perfectly. What makes them particularly relevant to our environment is their spirit. The project's aims were to challenge existing stereotypes by having older women capture their own portraits of how they are growing older...With great regularity we see colleagues from other parts of the University and visitors pause and take time to view our gallery. It is fair to say that the responses are overwhelmingly positive...We congratulate Dr Lorna Warren and her team on this hugely successful project that has helped us to show to the public who we think the diverse group of 'older women' can be&amp;quot;. (Dr Christine Dobbs, Research Officer).

The Older People and Ageing Research and Development Network Cymru (OPAN) worked in partnership with ABMU Health Board and Swansea Metropolitan University to bring a collection of art works to Swansea which explored the theme of ageing. The works formed a trail linking buildings across Swansea University campus and Singleton Hospital. The Coming of Age Trail involved visiting the permanent Look at Me! exhibition which is in situ at the Centre for Innovative Ageing at the University of Swansea. Guided tours were led by Prue Thimberley (Arts &amp;amp; Health Co-ordinator for Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board and Swansea Metropolitan University) between May 1st - June 21st 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://comingofageswansea.com/comingofage/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog on International Women's Day 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CE8108B-FD21-41D0-9562-DD123CCCCEFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guest blog by Lorna Warren 'From Look Me In The Eye to Look At Me!: Representations of Gender and Ageing'.

A handful of cinema-goers, all men, expressed resentment at the inclusion of the films in the Thursday slot, some because they had driven to the Cinema and had limited parking time.

&amp;quot;It's really fascinating, watching people's reaction to them - they are in our reception area and in our shop. People look at them while they wait for a service or a meeting. They always get a reaction. People usually don't understand them at first - they have to read the blurb beside the images or have them explained. They are seriously challenging - they challenge people's perceptions of what's right and wrong. Once people understand what they're about they either love them or hate them - depending how they feel about being challenged. The images make people feel uncomfortable; they open our minds to the possibility that there is beauty in old age&amp;quot;.

It has demonstrated how image manipulation can affect older women's body image/quality of life and the need to raise awareness of the combined effects of ageism and sexism earlier in the life-course. Its innovative, multidisciplinary methods have generated widely displayed, iconoclastic participant images, and ensured older women's central involvement in challenging stereotypes. They have highlighted the contribution of visual approaches and creative activity to participatory processes and well-being. Collaboration has been extended through a follow-on initiative delivering ageism awareness workshops in a local school. Wider societal impacts include citation of project findings by the Commission on Older Women and the launch of a Charter against Ageism and Sexism in the Media. Collectively, the impacts have attracted broad coverage in popular and academic media, and numerous invitations to present at public events.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AADA0EB2-CF7C-4C04-BE8C-90FF589B58B1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Previous research has shown that older women are negatively stereotyped, the butt of humour, the focus of a rapidly expanding anti-ageing industry, or otherwise absent from the media. The Representing Self-Representing Ageing (RSRA) project demonstrated the success of working collaboratively with older women, using a range of innovatory participatory visual methods, in exploring their everyday experiences of growing older, understanding how ageing may be framed for women by the media, and creating alternative images of 'ordinary' older women that can be used to challenge stereotypes. The project found that, compared with women in older age groups (75+), baby boomers were more conscious of being stereotyped, misrepresented, or absent from media images and felt greater pressure on them to look a certain way. Collectively participants called for more images of &amp;quot;ordinary&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;natural&amp;quot; older women in the media who had not been surgically or digitally enhanced. They also wanted to see representations which show older women can make a contribution and be independent so that younger people might be less fearful of ageing. The women produced a diverse range of visual artwork including photos, fine art and sculpture and these have been displayed in a number of exhibitions in venues across the UK. Participants captured a range of experiences, including: continuation of involvement in public life through employment or volunteering and of enjoyment of life and friendships; aspects of ageing seldom seen in mainstream media such as grief and loss; and fears of contracting horizons, increasing limitations, or a fear of fading away.
Participating in the project gave women a sense of solidarity, ownership of the research process and public validation. Impacts on well-being included altered attitudes to their own ageing and enduring friendships. Two participants joined a theatre group exploring age-focused performance, two more established a lunch club. One participant, who has been involved in considerable press activity commented &amp;quot;this has been the highlight of my bloody life!&amp;quot;
Public response to the exhibition was positive: 87% of visitors found the exhibition either 'good' or 'very good'. The research has been cited by the Labour Party in its Commission on Older Women and has directly contributed to consultations on Sheffield City Council's 'Strategy for an Ageing Population' and Birmingham Policy Commission 'Healthy Ageing in the 21st Century' (2013).
Current work is extending collaborations in new directions. Project participants stressed the importance of raising awareness of ageing issues early on in children's education. Workshops in a local primary school have therefore brought together older women from the RSRA project with pupils aged 10-11 years to explore understandings of ageing and later life in Act Your Age! workshops. The school's contribution to raising awareness of issues of diversity and equality has been recognised by Ofsted. At the same time, a national seminar on Ageism, Sexism and the Media, chaired by Miriam O'Reilly has led to the launch of a Charter against Ageism and Sexism (ChASM), developed in collaboration with Women Ageing and Media, National Union of Journalist and Women in Journalism.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Communities
The project has demonstrated the impact of participatory visual methods on quality of life in communities. Therapeutic approaches may be used to alter individuals' attitudes towards their own ageing with an enduring shared group effect. Working with a professional photographer in a community setting may improve quality of life in the short-term through fun creative activities which bring attention to participants as individuals as well as the wider activities of the group. For example, one resident's comment that: &amp;quot;when I came in here I thought it was the end, now I've done [the project] I know that's not true&amp;quot; highlights the potential for using creative arts in Extra Care housing schemes. Feeling personally invested in research which has demonstrable visible outcomes (multiple public exhibitions, city-wide advertising, press coverage etc) can further increase impact on well-being and sense of public validation.

Policy
The RSRA project has drawn attention to the representation of women and ageing in the media and has already been cited by various policy bodies concerned with women, health and ageing (see Key Findings above). An on-line petition enabling individuals/organisations to sign up to ChASM has been established (www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/petition.html). The project has the additional potential to contribute to campaigning groups including the UK Be Real: Body Confidence for Everyone Campaign (a development of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image), the international Endangered Bodies campaign, and the internet-based Everyday Sexism initiative set up by Laura Bates where, so far, the focus has rested largely on the effects of distorted imagery and of sexism on younger women's attitudes to their bodies. 

Culture
The project exhibition attracted considerable footfall and 88% of visitors said they would like to see more images of older women displayed in public. The exhibition has subsequently been shown at venues around the UK. Selected images are now on permanent display at the Age UK Sheffield offices, and at Swansea University's Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University where they have formed part of an arts-based Coming of Age Trail. Images also appear on the cover of 2 academic books on representations of older age. The 5 project films, available on the website (www.representing-ageing.com), have been shown at the Showroom arts cinema in Sheffield to hundreds of cinema-goers. Recent activities, in which huge images of older women were beamed onto some of the City's most famous buildings as part of the 2014 ESRC Festival of Social Science, attest to the continued positive reception of images of older women in public spaces and their power to prompt conversations about gender and age (www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/now-can-you-see-me-images-of-older-women-in-sheffield.html). 

Education
The RSRA project is being used as a case study in 4 PhD and 2 MA theses. Knowledge transfer activities arising from the project have included: a KT EQUAL older people as active researchers workshop; a commissioned methods toolkit, commissioned partnership working guidelines; and a commissioned article in Sociology Review (a journal for A/AS sociology students). Future plans include development of the intergenerational Act Your Age! workshops (see Key Findings above) with the aim of including age awareness as a fundamental element of PSHE and citizenship curricula and associated learning outcomes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>84EA7019-F77E-4043-916E-10517EC292D6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.representing-ageing.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence to the Commission on Older Women - Older Women in Public Life: Visual Representations and Discrimination</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42B8BFDF-80FA-4858-A36D-6A9F96C2D638</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/Commission_on_Older_Women_-_Interim_Report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Birmingham Policy Commission, Healthy Ageing in the 21st Century</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49592EF3-5E8A-444D-9AD2-1BA7A7B72755</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/Documents/research/policycommission/healthy-ageing/Healthy-Ageing-Policy-Commission-Report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Women and Dementia (funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Dementia Without Walls programme, and run jointly by Innovations in Dementia CIC and Social Policy Research Unit, Uni of York.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95984AE4-7D62-4D7B-A1B1-D52BFD414BA6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dementiawomen.org.uk/index.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All Party Parliamentary Group on Body Image</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84390EF3-EDDB-40B7-9A24-1FE21724F356</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lorna Warren submitted written evidence (23.2.12) on the findings of the Representing Self - Representing Ageing project to the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Body Image public inquiry into body image dissatisfaction.
