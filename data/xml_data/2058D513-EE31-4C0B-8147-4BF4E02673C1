Globally girls around the world have developed their own personal strategies to cope with menstruation. These vary greatly from country to country, individual's personal preferences, available resources, local traditions and cultural beliefs and knowledge or education. Some of the menstrual practices have been associated with different health outcomes (Bacterial vaginosis and urogenital infections)(9). Across the globe menstruation and its management also have important social and cultural implications which may in turn impact girl's lives. Absence from school, has been of particular interest to International organisations and research bodies working in this area such a WaterAid, the Water Research Commission and Plan International. These organizations report that in their experience girls' absence from school during menstruation can have both physical and psychological causes. A literature review we conducted in 2013 found there was good evidence that educational interventions can improve menstrual hygiene practices and reduce social restrictions but there was no quantitative evidence that improvements in menstrual knowledge and management methods reduce school absenteeism and urogenital infections. This work will contribute to increase the knowledge on the effectiveness of potentially scalable interventions to improve menstrual hygiene management, school attendance of Gambian schoolgirls and reduce urogenital infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Menstrual hygiene interventions may improve girls' school attendance. A systematic review we conducted in 2013 identified 7 interventions studies of menstrual hygiene education which show some evidence that educational interventions can improve MHM practices and reduce social restrictions but the studies had methodological issues(9). A recent qualitative study we carried out among Gambian schoolgirls showed that girls had a poor knowledge about menstruation and that some of the reasons why they miss school were association with menstrual hygiene management (8). Achieving higher levels of education are correlated to important public health outcomes, including reduction of early pregnancies, risk of HIV infection infant and maternal mortality as well as improvements in the nutritional status of children. The aim of this research will be: 1)to test different methods to measure outcomes and collection of basic epidemiology data, 2)understand the intervention needs of the target population,3)to refine the intervention, 4)to assess acceptability and feasibility of the intervention among schoolgirls, parents and teachers.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147030</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We are collecting a very exhaustive data about different menstrual hygiene practices and knowledge from 400 school adolescent girls.

We are also developing new method to collect data about the stress generated by managing menstruation in girls attending to the study schools. For that we are using an adapted scale and a new method designed by us.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0E28D0E-86A5-48FE-8750-D36A0AADBCA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This new tool could be useful to measure stressed/disconfort generated by management of menstruation among adolescent girls.

We are using 3 methods:

With this methods we would like to assess which ones could be more useful to capture school absenteeism related to menstrual hygiene management issues.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72764C7B-E67C-46AD-BFE5-2C3E9BAF52EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are collecting the data now, we have not have time to analyse or present to the public but we anticipate that these methods will be very useful for further research projects assessing school absenteism related to MHM.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Different tools to measure school attendance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We collected urine from the adolescent girls participating into our study, to assess for first time, the association between different menstrual hygiene practices and urinary tract infections (UTI).
