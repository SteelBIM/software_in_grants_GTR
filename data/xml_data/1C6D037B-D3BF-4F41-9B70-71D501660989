The project addresses several fundamental questions in the recently emerged and rapidly evolving theory of combinatorial limits. This theory led to a better understanding of important concepts in combinatorics and theoretical computer science, e.g. regularity and property testing, it provided analytic tools that were used to solve many long standing open problems in extremal combinatorics, and it opened new links between analysis, combinatorics, ergodic theory, group theory and probability theory. One of the reasons for the rapid growth of the theory of combinatorial limits comes from computer science where structures such as the graph of internet connections or graphs of social networks (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn) are of enormous size and the tools from theory of combinatorial limits can be used to approximate these structures by analytic objects.

We plan to extend the range of possible applications of the flag algebra method in extremal combinatorics by adopting the method to new settings, in particular those related to Tur&amp;aacute;n densities, and give applications of the method to specific problems from extremal combinatorics. We will also use the flag algebra arguments to gain new insights in the relation between finitely forcible graph limits and optimal solutions of extremal combinatorics problems.

The concepts related to the limits of dense and sparse discrete structures were developed to a large extent separately and an attempt to bridge the gap between them was made through the model theory inspired notion of FO convergence. We plan to explore the limits of representing FO convergent sequences by the corresponding analytic objects (modellings). Our intention is also to use the knowledge gained to provide a more robust notion of convergence which would be less sensitive to minor local modifications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The topics addressed in this proposal are of very high importance and significance. Several prestigious awards have recently been given in relation to the results related to theory of combinatorial limits. The large amount of interest of the community in the area is also demonstrated by many meetings (e.g. the conference on graphs and analysis organized by IAS in Princeton in 2012) and many research schools focused on this newly emerged theory. It is expected that the new results of this project will attract a significant amount of attention similar to comparable earlier results in the area.

The mathematical and computer science community will be updated on the project achievements through presentations at international conferences, through journal publications (all papers will be made freely available on arXiv at the time of submission and they will follow the open access policy of EPSRC) and through interaction with the team members at conferences and research focused workshops.

Two of the objectives of the project are related to extremal combinatorics and the new tools developed can be applied by other researchers to problems in the area. Likewise, many extremal combinatorics problem play an important role in algorithm and data structure design and analysis and this is another area of the potential impact of the proposed project.

The other two objectives of the project are related to bridging the gap between the notions of convergence for dense and sparse discrete structures. These objectives are of more theoretical nature. However, gaining a proper understanding of the interplay of different ways how to approximate large discrete structures is important for developing the right models for large networks, one of the very original motivations for developing graph limits, which is another area of the potential impact of the results of the proposed project in computer science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>301247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant is still in progress (about half way through its life period). So far, we have made significant progress in understanding the structure of graph limits, which form mathematical models of large networks. In particular, we have developed techniques that show that some simply described graph limits (those determined by finitely many substructure densities) can contain very complex substructures. We have also studied the existence of limits capturing properties of graphs expressible in the first order logic, where we have shown the existence of analytic objects representing well-structured graphs (e.g. those with bounded path-width).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope that the techniques developed with the support of this grant will contribute to designing strong models of real-life networks, in particular, those appearing in computer science. To obtain such models, it is important to understand the properties of the current models, which has been the objective of this grant. To help to achieve this goal, we organized a workshop in December 2016 (as envisioned in the &amp;quot;Pathway to impact&amp;quot; document). Its the aim was to bring together researchers working on algorithms, logic and structural graph theory, who seldom meet at conferences, and offer a lot of time for mutual discussions. Further information can be found at http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/daniel_kral/alglogstr/ . The workshop helped to understand the results supported by this grant in a broader context of other mathematical and computer science problems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7C1BAFC2-FA5A-45F8-A0E5-335673DAAC5F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E2A24468-C8E5-4368-B9C1-C6BCC70FAA21"><gtr:id>E2A24468-C8E5-4368-B9C1-C6BCC70FAA21</gtr:id><gtr:title>First order convergence of matroids</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Combinatorics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e5ee1e3f5df09b83e39b349476972b94"><gtr:id>e5ee1e3f5df09b83e39b349476972b94</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kardo?
