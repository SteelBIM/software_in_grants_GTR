Only a year ago, East Africa was the last major region on Earth without fibre-optic broadband internet connections. People were forced to rely on painfully slow and prohibitively expensive satellite connections. However, the recent arrival of three submarine fibre-optic cables into the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa has now fundamentally altered the connectivity of the region. This paper presents preliminary findings from case-studies in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sectors of two East Africa Countries (Kenya and Rwanda). Specifically, the paper compares stated potentials of broadband internet before the arrival of the cables, expectations amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs) after the arrival of the cables and actual effects that broadband connectivity is having on the value chains of SMEs.

Abstract:



Business Processing Outsourcing (BPO) was intended to be Kenya's next big export earner and a source of employment for its graduates. After observing the successes of India and the Philippines, Kenya made substantial investments into infrastructure, hoping to woo global business onshore. Consultants pronounced Kenya's niche to be contact centres due to the country's educated workforce and its neutral English accents. Over the past few years, things have changed dramatically. Finding it difficult to establish direct contact with clients overseas, many Kenyan BPO managers were forced to take on exploitative contracts with intermediaries. The global recession also negatively impacted the sector, drying up work opportunities and putting pressure on Western governments to bring back jobs. Kenyan BPO companies have undergone painful re-orientations. Many have closed. Others have turned to 'impact sourcing', positioning Kenya as a site for corporate social responsibility work. The BPOs that remain increasingly cater to local and regional clients. The government has responded by encouraging a new culture of outsourcing within East Africa. It is said that this local experience will inspire confidence in international clients and better protect Kenyan BPO firms from external shocks. Efforts have also been stepped up to attract Indian BPO and Western ICT companies to Kenya. After being hailed as a booster of exports, BPO has in effect, become an import, modernising and globalising Kenya's own organisations. This paper explores how an idea aimed at boosting exports to the outside world ultimately became a discourse about modernizing the home economy.

The meeting also brought together stakeholders from various parts of the tourism value chain: including hotels, tour operators, travel agents, ancillary service providers and tourism associations. These meetings were constructed to maximize the amount of time that participants had to discuss issues within a small group setting and provide feedback. Discussion in these sessions focused on current vs. desired value chains, disintermediation, new entrants, and changes in supplier-customer connections. The researchers offered presentations of preliminary findings in each of these areas, but participants then worked together to develop common critiques and understandings of each topic.

In the original grant proposal, we identified the ways that practice and policy making around the information society are often undertaken &amp;quot;without clear understandings as to the specific ways in which local firms can best take advantage of newly altered positionalities&amp;quot;. Indeed, project findings supported this suspicion and we found marked contrast between the expectations of connectivity from global organisations, regional politicians and technology firms engaging in the region and realities. A crucial goal was thus to disseminate our findings in order to question existing expectations around connectivity, and ultimately impact on misguided policy stemming from skewed expectations. 

Discrepancies between the expectations and actual impacts of changing connectivity relate both to academic knowledge and policy. To influence ICT policy one needs to begin from a position of clear empirically-supported argument. Thus, we discuss both academic and policy interaction here. Academically, sessions have been organised as part of key high-profiles conferences (such as the AAG, ICTD and ECAS) which look to begin to reconfigure the academic agenda around the information society and connectivity. We also sought to engage in events that link academic findings and policy in order to influence policy making. For instance presentations and papers were made at a number of global policy focussed events such as the Internet Africa Summit, CPR South Conference and a talk to the delegates of the UNCTAD Commission on Science and Technology for development in Washington DC. In such forums, we sought to translate finding into tangible recommendations for policy professionals in the areas of ICT and internet policy. More directly, we have facilitated several one-on-one meetings with higher ranking officials involved in information policy such as former Director General of Communications in South Africa and the current ICT minister of Columbia. Finally, in partnership with other groups in Oxford University, team members have been running a regular the flagship 'ICTD Seminar series', inviting key thinkers to discuss topics of ICT in developing countries and frequently linking to research findings of this project. Events were also webcast and freely shared online. The webcasts have been viewed and have been watched over 7000 times. 

Thus, this combination of impact activities - contributions to academic conferences, policy forums, direct engagement with senior policy makers and Oxford based events - has allowed us to post questions to policy linked to broadband connectivity in the Global South. Two examples include PI Mark Graham's invitation to serve on DFID's Digital Advisory Panel (which allows experiences from the project to inform global policy agendas, and has also resulted in a series of research-based presentations to senior figures in DFID: including the Secretary of State) and CI Tim Waema's chairmanship in the Kenyan ICT Masterplan (as an example of how this work is concretely influencing new plans and policy formations).

Specific activities in East Africa have been important in making research findings impactful in regional policy making circles. The most visible impact here is PI Tim Waema's invitation to be chairman for the Kenyan ICT Masterplan. The extent that the final policy report weaves the conclusions of research from the project into core goals is notable. The policy is one of the first ICT policies in Kenya that places broadband policy at its centre and the framework of activity developed - in broadband infrastructure and broader sectoral goals - is a case where our research has overtly informed policy making. More recently, the project members have also completed and disseminated final project reports (as well as short 'executive summary' and 'policy brief' documents). As part of the final outreach meetings, this material has been widely shared with East African policymakers and practitioners. This work is relatively recent, so tracking impact is difficult, but we suspect that they will likely be a crucial source of empirical evidence for future policy making in the region.

In-hand with policy influence, a key goal for impact was in influencing best practices around use of connectivity within the three sectors researched (as well as other service and agricultural sectors). The main initiative has been the twelve sectoral meetings that have taken place in Kenya and Rwanda during the project - six early result/focus group meetings and five final outreach meetings (one for each sector with each of the two countries). Attendance has on average been around 25 participants in each session. Response to presentations and reports has been good and feedback has been encouraging suggesting that sectoral specific policy advice drawn from this research is influencing online activity. All of the events also included networking elements so that contacts and best practice could be shared. 

Sectoral meetings were also undertaken in partnership with key institutions related to the sectors (e.g. the Kenyan Tea Development Agency (KTDA), Rwanda Development Board (RDB), The Rwanda Tourism Chamber, and the iHub &amp;amp; kLab technology innovation hubs). This ensured that the findings and suggestions for good practice were integrated into ongoing local initiatives, and that that the project findings have local champions to drive longer term impact. This is illustrated for example in how our research in connectivity in the Rwandan tea sector in partnership with kLab innovation hub in Kigali has supported and informed the ongoing ICT and agricultural programmes being undertaken by this organisation. When there has been opportunity, we have also sought to generalise our results and offer wider cross-sectoral recommendations related to the region's changing connectivity. For example, we apply our extend tea sector research related agricultural practice (for instance, in running the well-received outreach event 'The Agricultural sector for ICT developers' in Rwanda). Project researcher Laura Mann also instigated a lecture series called 'Nairobi Research Buzz' at the Nairobi iHub which looked to draw on our own research (and the research of others) into more general debate about connectivity and innovative practice in Kenya.

We have also sought to feed our work back into the practices of SMEs and emerging businesses in East Africa. The project has been closely involved in ongoing partnerships with two technology innovation hubs (iHub and kLab), regularly presenting and disseminating work. Wherever possible, we have sought to actively support these institutions (for instance through our starting of the research seminar series mentioned above) These hubs have been key spaces for supporting emerging and new generation of practitioners and our support and dissemination into these spaces is crucial. 

Finally, this research has also made a wider contribution to public understanding around development and specifically digital development in East Africa. The project team has frequently presented work and written articles in mainstream media and press (for instance the BBC, The Guardian, The Atlantic, New Scientist, TEDx and SciDev.net): discussing a broad set of related issues around the social and economic impacts of emerging networks and technologies in Africa. Supporting this work, has been frequent and dynamic use of social media by the project team. This included a series of articles on the well-known Oxford Internet Institute's blog, a broader range of work on many of the team's personal blogs and microblogs, and more detailed discussions on the Institute's 'Internet and Policy' blog.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4488FC09-8F34-4789-BBEB-3BB4423B71C2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Following the arrival of the first ever submarine fibre-optic cables into East Africa, this project examined the expectations and the impacts of changing connectivity in Kenya and Rwanda. Through interviews and a content analysis of key speeches and texts, we found that politicians and business speak of growing connectivity using the language of economic transformation - of 'leap-frogging to become knowledge economies'. 

However, we found very few cases in which changing connectivity was actually a key driver of significant economic change. In the three sectors that we studied (BPO, tea, tourism), changing connectivity tended to benefit established firms (often multi-nationals) and their existing value chain relationships/configurations. There was certainly widespread use of new forms of connectivity amongst small firms (driven by lower prices and expectations that better internet access would support growth). This use has facilitated efficiency gains and improved trust, but small firms are still limited in how they exploit this connectivity: by their ability to use new technologies, in management and implementation skills around integrating technology, and in finance to support investments in connectivity.

The lack of significant transformative effects brought about by changing connectivity should not solely be seen as a deficiency in the capacities of small firms. There are also more systematic and global-scale barriers that can be observed when we examined how firms attempted to either disintermediate value chains or interact with distant markets. 

In the three sectors studied, the interaction of better connectivity and mediation in value chains was complex. While some intermediaries are being marginalised, we found new processes of 'reintermediation' where online platforms or new information-driven relations integrate into core value chains. These new intermediaries are often even more exclusionary and value extracting than previous configurations. 

East African firms in all sectors have looked to explore use of the online resources to reach end-markets, but frequently find themselves limited by the barriers embedded in the global sectors they are engaging with. In tea, established retailers in end markets, and the large costs of marketing, limit direct customer engagement; BPO firms in East Africa are often too small to take on the large and complex requirements of international firms who are looking to outsource demand. Better connectivity and the potential of more immediate engagement cannot simply overcome these structural limits.

In sum, this work suggests a two-fold awareness in policy and practice. First, better connectivity does enable tangible benefits, and clear regulatory policy that pays careful attention to value-for-money and moves beyond hype around how 'knowledge societies' can boost East African firms attempting to make the most of new forms of connectivity. Second, digital connectivity (and indeed wider ICT) policy should pay particular attention to the wider socio-technical limitations - skills, finance, systems - that prevent East African firms from taking advantage of online opportunities (issues that are amplified by inequalities within global production networks).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have shown that expectations and impacts of changing connectivity in East Africa are significantly different. This matters because many policy makers and business managers have enacted plans and strategies based on steeply unrealistic goals. From a research perspective, these findings have been expanded on by the PI through a five-year, ERC-funded, project to better understand successful strategies that have emerged in Sub-Saharan Africa's 'knowledge economies.' But there remains much scope for further interrogations of precisely who is winning and who is losing at this moment of changing connectivities. 

More practically, these findings could be taken forward by national-level policy makers. More targeted policies to support the ability of small firms to export to new markets and capture more value in existing value chains could be developed by focusing on some of the socio-technical barriers outlined in our three outcome reports. In Kenya, some of our findings related to the BPO sector have already been placed into the policy sphere (see impact narrative). Such policy activity might be extended to a broader range of national contexts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9088EC2A-0FCB-4829-BAB3-B1E8264A0CF8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/eastafrica/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citations in National ICT Masterplan (2014-2017)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEC8B224-F0CB-4D66-ABF8-7E644731A5FB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.icta.go.ke/national-ict-masterplan/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Keynote to Socialists and Democrats grouping in the European Parliament</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3CDEBE64-FBEA-4165-A676-A38D8FD486E7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.socialistsanddemocrats.eu/events/sd-group-seminar-how-use-opportunities-digital-union-order-fight-social-and-regional</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of DFID's Digital Advisory Panel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEA066AB-05E2-46ED-A7FC-8FDE020367B6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/dfid-digital-advisory-panel</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Project Researcher (Waema) was Chairman for Kenyan National ICT Masterplan - 2014-2017</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AAC9E9E-E69F-4448-AB60-7927E9F8ECBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Whilst this Masterplan is only in it's early stages of implementation, the output of the Masterplan focus on improving the regulatory environment and delivering economic impact.
