Chemicals</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/L013940/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In our search for better medicines to improve healthcare in an ageing population, for safer agrochemicals to aid food production for a growing population, and for advanced materials for new technologies, the global demand for molecules based upon a group of relatively simple carbon based molecules (including ethylene, propylene, butadiene and benzene) continues to increase. Sadly current petroleum and natural gas based supply chains simply can't continue to expand to meet this burgeoning need. We can only close this increasing gap between supply and demand by innovating and solving serious scientific challenges. 

Funded by the BBSRC and other UK research councils (EPSRC/TSB), the UK Government has initiated the creation of a number of multidisciplinary Synthetic Biology Research Centres (SBRC) charged with the accelerating the realisation of the benefits of the outputs of Synthetic Biology to business and society. Synthetic biology is &amp;quot;the design and engineering of biologically based parts, novel devices and systems as well as the redesign of existing, natural biological systems&amp;quot;. It is a newly emerged scientific discipline that has arisen through the merger of several core areas of science, principally biology, engineering, chemistry and Information Communication Technology (ICT). Synthetic Biology has the potential to create new products and processes by engineering biological systems to perform new functions in a modular, reliable and predictable way, allowing modules to be reused in different contexts. 

The Nottingham SBRC will use Synthetic Biology to engineer microorganisms that can be used to manufacture the molecules and fuels that modern society needs in a cleaner and greener way. We will harness the ability of organisms, to 'eat' single-carbon containing gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). When these gases are injected into the liquid medium of fermentation vessels they are consumed by the bacterium and converted into more desirable and useful molecules. Fortunately CO, our initial target, is an abundant resource, and a waste product of industries such as steel manufacturing, oil refining and chemical production. Moreover, it can be readily generated in the form of Synthesis Gas ('Syngas'), by the gasification (heating) of forestry and agricultural residues, municipal waste and coal. By allowing the use of all these available low cost, non-food resources, such a process both overcomes concerns over the use of land resources that could be used for food production. Furthermore, capturing the large volume of CO (destined to become CO2 once released into the atmosphere) emitted by industry for fuel and chemical production provides a net reduction in fossil carbon emissions. We will also develop new organisms that can grow on the sugar (glucose and xylose) released from the deconstruction of biomass, derived from municipal waste, agricultural residues and specialist crops grown on land that is unsuitable for food production.

The core scientific aims of the SBRC at Nottingham, therefore, will be to specify, design, test, validate and exploit microbial cell factories needed for the efficient production of the chemical that are essential for a modern industrial society.

Through effective communication and promotion we will showcase new science and demonstrate how organism can make important molecules that will take the place of current fossil fuel based feedstocks. We will improve the current public perception of the scientific community and show how innovation can lead to economic and environmental benefits. We are passionate about sustainability and we believe we can share this vision to the rest of the UKs scientific community and the general public who use our products.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>THE AIM: 
SBRC Nottingham will focus on the sustainable and economically viable production of platform/speciality chemicals through SynBio-engineered, gas fermenting microbes capable of using single carbon (C1) feedstocks. 

THE NEED: 
Much current attention is focused on deriving microbial production chassis for the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels. Until now, the emphasis has been on lignocellulosic fermentative processes that use non-food plant biomass. However, developing economic processes that efficiently convert plant material into the necessary sugar feedstock is proving challenging. 

THE SOLUTION: 
Nottingham's groundbreaking alternative approach is to use gas-fermenting microbes that are able to grow on C1 gases, such as CO and CO2. These may be derived from non-food sources such as waste gases from industry ( e.g., steel manufacturing, oil refining, coal and natural/shale gas) as well as 'synthesis gas' (CO &amp;amp; H2) produced from sustainable resources, such as biomass and domestic/ agricultural wastes. This enables a wide range of valuable advanced fuels and chemicals to be produced in any industrialized geography without consumption of valuable food or land resources. 

THE GOALS: 
Nottingham is already working on an anaerobic gas fermenting chassis with LanzaTech, Evonik, Lanxess and, through CPI, to a wider network of industrial companies. Building on this activity, the major SBRC thrust will be to develop a chassis for aerobic gas fermentations and to use it to implement pathways for chemicals that are more favourably produced in a respiring organism. 

THE OUTPUTS:
Ethylene, propylene, iso-butene, butadiene and isoprene make ideal nodes within the chemical network as their volatile nature simplifies extraction, they have huge industry demand and they provide the basis for a wide range of valuable downstream products such as fuels, tyres, high tech performance polymers/ coatings and personal care products and pharmaceuticals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Trends in capital investment within the chemicals sector suggests that the bulk and speciality chemicals sectors, both of which have traditionally been strengths of the UK production industry, are following the pharmaceuticals sector to SE Asia. If the UK is to remain competitive across the Bulk and Speciality chemicals sectors we must forge a new generation of processes with intrinsic emphasis on efficiency, process integration and resource management. Developing technology platforms with a reduced dependence on traditional petroleum based materials is acknowledged as the only long-term solution to sustainability. 

Looking at local market rationale for this SBRC proposition, the chemical-using industries continue to be one of the strongest sectors of the UK economy, employing 230,000 highly skilled people, spending &amp;pound;3.5 billion on R&amp;amp;D and the UK's top manufacturing export earner. Its products are the basis for almost every manufacturing activity. However, it is also energy-intensive and almost totally dependent on imported petroleum as its basic raw material. It is vulnerable to rising global oil prices and disruption to global oil supplies. This SBRC will strategically de-risk this reliance on petroleum, delivering supply chain security and reducing environmental. 

Almost every major chemical company has set ambitious targets to lower their carbon footprint, or even to become carbon neutral. To achieve this there must be re-alignment from fossil fuel dependencies and efficient use of carbon in its simplest forms, specifically of C1 gases that may be generated as by-products from other existing processes (CO, CO2 and CH4). 

Specifically Nottingham SBRC will deliver impact in the following sectors:

ECONOMY: Sustainability is the major issue facing the global chemical industry. Not only is there concern for our environment, there is also is a strong economic driver. Shareholders place emphasis on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (http://www.sustainability-ndex.com) that tracks the performance of the chemicals industry and engenders competition. A commitment to responsible innovation, and the application of SynBio as a key platform to products will secure the UK lead in innovation and chemicals production. 

PEOPLE: There is a clear and increasing demand for highly qualified technologists that are trained to lead innovation and manage the deployment of SynBio based techniques into industry. SBRC offers a market driven &amp;quot;shared vision&amp;quot; towards products and processes. SBRC will deliver highly skilled individuals via the SBRC linked DTC that will be well placed to influence and manage the required change to sustainable working practices across chemical manufacturing industries.

SOCIETY: The diverse range of products manufactured by the chemical-using industries is vital to maintaining a high quality of life in the UK, SBRC will have a direct impact on this activity by ensuring a supply of people and new knowledge to secure sustainability of the sector for the benefit of all. The &amp;quot;green and sustainable&amp;quot; agenda is now firmly fixed in the public consciousness, SBRC will be an exemplar of how scientists and engineers can provide real solutions to very challenging scientific and technical problems, for the benefit of society

KNOWLEDGE: In addition to increasing the supply of highly trained people, the results of research performed in our SBRC will have a major impact on knowledge. Via synthetic biology SBRC researchers will tackle &amp;quot;big problems&amp;quot; in sustainable chemistry, and via our industrial partners we will ensure that new knowledge is applied in industry. Knowledge based activity will drive innovation and economic activity for UK PLC creating new jobs and securing the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-07-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>14242855</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Louise Dynes (SBRC Outreach officer) has also been working with Ignite, which is a Nottingham charity that works with the local community to promote STEM subjects and Dance Equation ( a leading Dance in Education Company dedicated to providing high quality dance workshops and performances for children).

Nottingham's contribution was the much anticipated &amp;quot;Secret Science Show&amp;quot; at Wollaton Hall, and taking part were C1net members Louise Dynes and Dr Vinod Kumar. Together they gave a presentation and interactive demonstration on 'the power of microbes' explaining how microbes can turn unwanted substances into useful ones such as plastics and fuels. Dr Kumar also explained and demonstrated how a bioreactor worked. The audience of 86, with an ages range from 6 to 60 participated enthusiastically in the Q&amp;amp;A session and left with the message that only a very small percentage of bacteria are bad and that many are useful .

FIRST&amp;reg; LEGO&amp;reg; League (FLL&amp;reg;) is a global science and technology competition with over 250,000 young people aged from 9 to 18 taking part each year. This is a global science and technology challenge for teams of students, to encourage an interest in real world issues and develop key skills that are crucial for their future careers. The students work together to explore a given topic and to design, build and program an autonomous LEGO robot to solve a series of missions.
Schools from around the East Midlands attended the event and as well as designing and building their project, there was an exhibition area for pupils to have a go at some table top outreach activities. 

The SBRC hosted some LEGO related activities including; building a bacterium from LEGO for the younger pupils and the older pupils had a go at designing plasmids using LEGO. Louise Dynes, SBRC Outreach Officer who organised the SBRC stand said 'LEGO is a great way of teaching microbiology to pupils, particularly building plasmids! I would like to thank everyone who helped out and made this day a success!' 

some of the older pupils who took part in the plasmid building were interested in doing more work around plasmids and would like more information and or us to come into their school/college.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SBRC Outreach Activity - University of Nottingham's Research Showcase</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECACE07C-88C2-47DB-8022-0686F3F03912</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this was an opportunity for researchers to share their passion for their work, practice their presentation skills and engage with the wider public.&amp;nbsp; Visitors to the Showcase have the opportunity to meet with world-leading researchers of the future, hear about their research and question them about what it means for society.

The learning journey took place over a month with 3 visits to the school by PhD students from the SBRC. The activities carried out during the visits were agreed between teachers and PhD students beforehand in order to support the schools' curriculum and showcase the expertise of the scientists, as well as excite pupils about the topic of microbiology and raising awareness of higher educational routes. 
Aims of the project:
? To build confidence and self-esteem through individual achievement and collaborating with a group
? To enable pupils to meet and work with real research scientists
? To give pupils a contextualised visit to the University of Nottingham
? To apply and improve their working scientifically skills (upper Key Stage Two National Curriculum) 
? To excite pupils about the topic of microbiology

Over 60 pupils were involved in the learning journey During each school visit the pupils had around 10-15 minutes to ask the PhD students questions and each filled this time with a range of questions. Pupils appeared engaged throughout. Questions were recorded in order to infer apparent areas of engagement.

? Over half of the questions asked were about the subject of microbiology
? Almost a quarter of the questions asked were about how and why the PhD students got into science 
? Just less than a quarter were about how to get to university and what it's like being at University 
When asked at the end of the learning journey over 3 quarters of the pupils wanted to go to University and over half wanted to study a science subject. 

Summary:
The project was very successful mainly in increasing pupils' interest in the subject of microbiology, and their understanding of the links between the subject and 'real life'. In addition, the project engaged pupils with the broader concept of advanced learning and future career opportunities. 

This initial learning journey is a model which hopefully will be rolled out each year to the same/different schools.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Schools Visit with a scientist from DUPONT (Yorkshire)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE861524-E06C-4CD6-8B05-A7A8FC47A071</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the Yorkshire STEM week the SBRC was invited to run sessions with DUPONT at local schools in the Beverley area. sessions included microbes, DNA, biofuels and fermentation. the pupils asked lots of questions about going to University and what it was like working in industry.

In our bid we outlined our delivery plan and we can now report that many of the deliverables have either been achieved or are on track. Our overall objectives and their progress towards them are listed below:-

LEVERAGE OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED STRENGTHS AND EXISTING INVESTMENT

- We have continued to make progress in terms of establishing further partnerships and income streams through grant and contract income. New income for the year totals over &amp;pound;4.5M and include academic and commercial partners in Europe, Brazil, the USA and the UK. 

- We have created a doctoral training programme of 25 PhD studentships with 10 appointments made. 

- During 2015 the University established a portfolio of 23 Research Priorities associated with five Global Research Themes. These will be the basis for promoting the University's research excellence. Members of the SBRC lead two of these areas, &amp;quot;Industrial Biotechnology&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Atoms to Products - Sustainable Supply Chains&amp;quot;. We see these as key instruments in meeting this objective. 

- One of our most significant accomplishments has been to co-locate the entire SBRC to the middle floor of the Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, bringing the wet and dry scientists into close proximity. 
 
ENSURE APPROPRIATE GOVERNANCE 

We established a strong package of governance, with three levels: (i) the Strategic Advisory Board which guides the direction of the SBRC, (ii) management groups including the Core Management Team (CMT) comprising the PI, several Co-Is, the Centre Manager and the Director of Business Engagement and Innovation Services, an Outreach and RRI Group (ORRIG) and the Operations Group and (iii) an Academic Leadership Team (ALT) which comprises all the SBRC Co-Is along with other leading Nottingham academics. The SAB comprises internationally-leading synthetic biology academics, relevant leading figures from industry as well as experts in Responsible Research and Innovation and representation from BBSRC and EPSRC. 

INSTIGATE A STRONG PROGRAMME OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT

We have delivered a packed programme of Outreach activities, exceeding our 1st year targets with 44 individual activities undertake. 

ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY, MAKING CORE TECHNOLOGIES AVAILABLE TO ALL PARTNERS

We continue to lever our industrial contacts and future economic impact to secure funding to sustain the SBRC longer-term. The SBRC has no formal industrial partners so that the IP generated is unfettered. The focus is, however, to innovate with industry in mind so that the underpinning academic research of the SBRC-Nottingham is able to accelerate the development of commercial processes. The critical mass at SBRC-Nottingham in gas fermentation expertise and use of anaerobic bacteria has led to Chain Biotech Ltd taking up residence within the SBRC-Nottingham, embedding their R&amp;amp;D activities in the SBRC labs. We intend that this nascent relationship will flourish for the company and the university through a seamless transition of technology from the bench to market-place and through externally-funded collaborative research projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are mindful of the importance of economic and social impact of the SBRC and have developed a range of marketing tools to enhance our Outreach activities and promote collaborations. We have built a website populated with news and articles which will eventually host videos as the SBRC develops. Integral to our website is the SBRC logo which has been designed to allow branding of the centre and associated research programmes flexibly. The website is evolving and is designed to target a number of audiences including various publics, academics, students and policy makers. We have established a Twitter account and have 167 followers. We deliver a quarterly newsletter, disseminated via a growing e-distribution list as well as through the website. We have delivered several press releases and are building a strategic link with the Nottingham Evening Post, working with them on a business-facing article on Synthetic Biology. We are very aware of the importance of the public image and liaise with our RRI colleagues to ensure a balanced view. We are building links with the BBSRC marketing team to draw on their expertise and insights. We have met and exceeded our Pathways to Impact Deliverables and Milestones for year 1.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>52FE834D-B73D-4B72-8970-2CBCF41AD8A8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial
