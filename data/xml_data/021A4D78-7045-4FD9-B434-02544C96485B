Some cameras have up to 41 million sensor pixels. Despite advances in sensor and optical technology, technically perfect photographs are still elusive in demanding conditions. In low light even the best cameras produce noisy images. Casual photographers cannot always hold the camera steady, and the photograph becomes blurry despite advanced shake reduction technologies. We are thus presented with the challenge of improving the photographs in post-processing. This would desirably be an automated process, based on mathematically well understood models that can be relied upon.

The difficulty with real photographs of tens of millions of pixels is that the resulting optimisation problems -- the task of finding the best enhanced image according to a model -- are huge, and computationally very intensive. Moreover, imaging problems generally computationally very intensive. State-of-the-art image processing techniques based on mathematical principles are only up to processing small images in real time. Further, choosing the right parameters for the models can be difficult. Parameter choice can be facilitated, but again in computationally very intensive ways. The question now is, can we design faster optimisation algorithms that would make this and other image processing tasks tractable for real high-resolution photographs?

The objective of the proposed project is to develop optimisation algorithms that are up to this task. The focus of the project is on general methods that will be applicable to a wide variety of image processing tasks and general big data problems. Besides photography, we will apply the developed tools to problems from biology and medicine, involving magnetic resonance imaging and microscopy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Digital images abound in numerous contexts from consumer cameras to professional imaging devices in medicine, earth and planetary sciences, and biology. The resolution of digital images is crucial for their understanding; the better resolved an image is, the more we can say about its contents. In reality, however, noise and sparse acquisition due to technical and physical limitations result in images with low resolution and distortions.

We are thus presented with the challenge of improving these images. Mathematically based higher-order geometric regularisation techniques by far outperform conventional approaches in terms of the visual quality of the results produced. Their efficient computational realisation however still remains poorly understood. In particular, current state-of-the-art techniques are not up to processing in reasonable time ten-million-megapixel photographs or other big images such as diffusion tensor images from medical MRI. In this project, we shall contribute to this understanding by developing novel optimisation methods for the solution of geometrically regularised mathematical imaging models.

The developed image reconstruction models will benefit everyone who deals with digital images. The processing of digital images is growing in importance in many different situations. From the enhancement of digital pictures from our last holidays in Spain to the processing and professional interpretation of images coming from medical imaging tools (e.g., MRI, CT, electron and optical microscopes), from security cameras and satellites, image processing is ubiquitous. Beneficiaries of optimisation methods for image reconstruction developed in this project include medical doctors who use imaging technology to diagnose a patient, the security sector for processing CCTV data, and higher education for making inverse problems, variational methods, and PDEs more accessible through a visual approach.

Moreover, this project will benefit the UK's initiative on Big Data. While our focus is single-disciplinary on mathematical imaging, the developed methods shall contribute to big data optimisation research, and thus benefit a multitude of areas of modern society ranging from sociological studies to economical planning. The ability to handle large amounts of data is one of the key challenges of modern times. Mathematical analysis is at the centre of developing algorithms for understanding big data. An indicator for the importance of algorithms in our society is the letter to the Prime Minister, &amp;quot;THE AGE OF ALGORITHMS&amp;quot;, from the Council for Science and Technology (by Sir Mark Walport, and Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell), 7th of June 2013.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>527191</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Schlumberger Cambridge Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sparse regularisation for seismic imaging</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2317AF1-65EF-4787-AC39-9C905E28DD8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publication in preparation; joint supervision of mathematics students; industrial talk by Evren Yarman to graduate students in mathematics in Cambridge in February 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Know how and funding.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Ongoing collaboration with Dr Evren Yarman on sparse regularisation and optimisation with applications in seismic imaging.

Hosted within the Faculty of Mathematics of the University of Cambridge, the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information will push the boundaries of information science.

Established through philanthropic support of &amp;pound;5 million from Cantab Capital Partners, the Institute will accommodate research activity on fundamental mathematical problems and methodology for understanding, analysing, processing and simulating data. Data science research performed in the Institute will be on the highest international level, aiming to extract the relevant information from large-and high-dimensional data with a predictable certainty.

At the heart of the Institute, will be the fundamental mathematical techniques and their intra-disciplinary engagement, upon which, the solution of big data questions so heavily relies. This is crucial in order to ensure advancements in data science.

Aims and Objectives

This launch event provided an opportunity to learn more about the work of the Institute, such as the specific questions that feed into fundamental methodology development. It is anticipated that the research will focus on various applications across a number of interdisciplinary engagements. These could include for instance, economists and social scientists on questions about financial markets and the internet, or with physicists and engineers on software and hardware development questions in the context of security.

Presentations at the event introduced areas of mathematical expertise represented in the Institute and outline how fundamental techniques can be drawn on to meet the challenge of deciphering meaning in the ever growing volumes of data. Academic expertise at the Institute includes:

Statistics
Applied and Computational Analysis
Stochastic Analysis and Probability
Inverse Problems
Convex Analysis
Stochastic and Sparse Optimisation
Compressed Sensing and Sampling Theory
Partial Differential Equations
Number Theory
Quantum Computing, Cryptography and Communication
The highlight of the launch was the inaugural lecture of the Institute given by Professor Ronald DeVore from Texas A&amp;amp;M University. Ron is one of the key figures of modern applied mathematics and made substantial contributions to approximation theory, numerical analysis of partial differential equations, wavelet transforms, machine learning algorithms and the theory of compressive sensing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.turing-gateway.cam.ac.uk/event/tgmw34</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alan Turing Institute Workshop on Theoretical and computational approaches to large scale inverse problems</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71E21671-8F4E-4C35-A605-5F1153F5104F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Inverse problems are at the heart of data science. The field is cross-&amp;shy;disciplinary both within mathematics, encompassing aspects of pure, applied as well as statistics, and across subjects, including physical sciences, engineering, medicine and biology to name only a few. Inverse problems arise in almost all fields of science when details of a postulated model have to be determined from a set of observed data. With inverse problems, scientists observe an effect and work to determine the cause; the ultimate goal is to find essential information (an object or material properties) that is hidden within the measurements. Biomedical imaging, for instance, gives rise to a variety of inverse problems in which the common goal is to produce an image visualising the interior of a living organism.


Some inversion approaches are based on effective use of a mathematical model in order to make optimal use of the data; other approaches involve model&amp;shy;blind data mining methods. Since inverse problems are concerned with the processing of data and extraction of relevant information, the field is considered part of Information Technology. Inverse problems are mathematically hard, since they are highly nonlinear, ill&amp;shy;posed and present important challenges of deep mathematical interest which are key to the development of reliable and accurate practical solution methods. Often the observed data is noisy, of large scale and high dimensional, and there is a significant challenge in determining the statistical properties of any proposed inversion.


Key scientific question to be answered:


? What methods are practical for large scale inverse problems?
? What sparse representations are useful in practice, and is convex relaxation sufficient for their application in regularisation?
? What posterior estimates are important for uncertainty quantification ?
? How can data science in health care profit from approaches based on computational analysis and statistical inference?
? What probability models can be used in very large dimensional problems where the amount of data is insufficient for robust statistical estimates?
? What is the correct approach to tackling infinite&amp;shy;dimensional problems : optimise then discretise, or vice&amp;shy;versa?
? How can deterministic and statistical approaches to optimisation be combined ?
? Can Physics inform Data Science ? (ie, what PDEs are useful)
? Can machine learning inform model selection ?
? How can multiple incommensurate data (e.g. in multimodal imaging) be scaled into a single likelihood measure ?


Key topics to be addressed:

? Modeling of the physical phenomena, for the forward problem
? Analysis of the corresponding inverse problem
? Identifying appropriate priors from (often large and/or rich) data sets
? Accurate and efficient numerical and statistical treatment of the forward and inverse problems
? Working with scientific computation and visualization aids
? Undertaking experimental verification/model selection
? Providing summary statistics for approximate inference
? Development of appropriate priors for regularisation and Bayesian inference

An inverse problem denotes the task of computing an unknown physical quantity from indirect measurements. The corresponding forward problem maps the physical quantity to the measurements. In most realistic situations the solution of the inverse problem is challenging, complicated by incomplete and noisy measurements, as well as non-invertible forward operators which render the inverse problem ill-posed (that is lack of stability and/or uniqueness of solutions). Inverse problems appear in many practical applications in biology, medicine, weather forecasting, chemistry, engineering, physics, to name but a few, and their analysis and solution presents considerable challenges in mathematics and statistics. This conference will bring together mathematicians and statisticians, working on theoretical and numerical aspects of inverse problems, and engineers, physicists and other scientists, working on challenging inverse problem applications. We welcome industrial representatives, doctoral students, early career and established academics working in this field to attend.

Background

We are currently experiencing many new exciting developments in imaging technology in biology and medicine. New advances in tomographic imaging, such as photoacoustic tomography, electron tomography, multicontrast magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) and combined MR with positron emission tomography (PET), as well as new technology in microscopy such as lightsheet microscopy, only mark the beginning of an era which revolutionises the extent of what we can see. New imaging technology always goes side by side with the need of mathematical models to maximise the information gain from these novel imaging techniques. For instance, previously tomographic imaging and light microscopy were separate imaging modalities, which were difficult to cross correlate. However, rapid development of new imaging hardware (light sheet, polarized PET, MRI), is now opening up new avenues for translational multimodal imaging. These developments are supported by sophisticated and rigorous mathematical models, which enhance the information in one imaging modality with information from another.

Aims and Objectives

New imaging technologies however, also bring new challenges to be overcome. In electron tomography for example, the limited angle problem is an intrinsic hardware limitation which results in viewpoint angles in which the imaged specimen cannot be resolved. Dynamic imaging techniques produce huge amounts of image data which require reliable and efficient methods for interpretation and analysis.

This one day meeting aimed to bring together those working on advances in imaging technology with researchers who investigate new image analysis methods, to help address these challenges. In particular, there was a focus on the following topics:

Big data problems and solutions
Multimodality
Dynamic imaging
The workshop facilitated the communication of both current opportunities and challenges of new imaging techniques. It also allowed for the sharing of knowledge on current approaches and solutions of mathematical modelling and analysis approaches, with presentations on industry insights and state-of-the-art mathematical techniques for Big Data Analytics.

This event was of interest to participants from the biomedical imaging industry, mathematics, engineering, computer science and physics, as well as biology and medicine.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.turing-gateway.cam.ac.uk/event/tgmw32</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LMS meetings on Current frontiers in inverse problems: from theory to applications</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4135B52F-BB7D-4928-815A-1D54BC2750E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 1976 Keller formulated the following very general definition of inverse problems, which is often cited in the literature:

&amp;quot;We call two problems inverses of one another if the formulation of each involves all or part of the solution of the other. Often, for historical reasons, one of the two problems has been studied extensively for some time, while the other is newer and not so well understood. In such cases, the former problem is called the direct problem, while the latter is called the inverse problem.&amp;quot;

Inverse problems appear in many situations in physics, engineering, biology and medicine. The main mathematical problem is the well (ill) - posedness of the inversion process. Indeed, in practice most inverse problems are ill-posed in terms of non-uniqueness or lack of stability of the inversion.

We hold four LMS meetings on inverse problems every year that bring together researchers who work on advancing the field of inverse problems, both from a theoretical and from an applied point of view.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/LMS_Inverse_Day_Edinburgh/Home.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PLUS magazine Mathematical Moments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F97CBB04-B628-49CD-8163-C07D7F98BA72</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mathematical moments: Carola-Bibiane Sch&amp;ouml;nlieb

Background

Launched in May this year, the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information (CCIMI) is now fully operational with research studentships and a number of exciting collaborative projects underway. Established through philanthropic support of &amp;pound;5 million from Cantab Capital Partners, the Institute accommodates research activity on fundamental mathematical problems and methodology for understanding, analysing, processing and simulating data. The data science research performed in the Institute is at the highest international level, with a key aim to extract relevant information from large and high-dimensional data with a predictable certainty.

The advance of data science and the solution of big data questions heavily relies on fundamental mathematical techniques and in particular, their intra-disciplinary engagement. This is at the heart of the Institute, involving mathematical expertise ranging from statistics, applied and computational analysis, to topology and discrete geometry - all with the common goal of advancing data science questions.

This event provided an opportunity for a more detailed update on current research taking place at the Institute, associated challenges and other potential collaborative opportunities.

 

Aims and Objectives

Current research projects being undertaken by the Institute encompass a variety of activity, from the development of mathematical and statistical tools and techniques for high-dimensional data analysis to hybrid image reconstruction and analysis models. As well as the development of rigorous machine learning methodologies that are accessible by mathematical and statistical analysis techniques. Applications of interest include adaptive image analysis, such as image classification, segmentation and enhancement, all the way to inverse problems in industrial and medical imaging.

This event provided an update to the original launch in May, providing more detailed information on research projects and collaborations, as well as highlighting potential new ones. It featured presentations of some of the current project collaborations.

The Institute currently has 11 projects:

Formation and Adaptation of Biological Transportation Networks
Statistical and Computational Aspects of Aggregating Data Summaries
Mathematics of Machine Learning: Mathematical Learning Methods for Adaptive and Robust Data Analysis
Mixing Times
Denoising Geodesic Ray Transforms
Mathematical challenges in Electron Tomography
Mathematical Challenges of Large Environmental Data Sets
Computational and Statistical Joint Image Analysis
Statistical Applications of Persistent Homology
Bayesian Inference for Discretely Sampled Diffusions - Solving the Nonlinear Inverse Problem
To Create a Semantic Search Engine for Mathematical Literature
For more information on these projects please visit the CCIMI Website.

The Institute's research and projects cover a diverse range of areas across Big Data and so we expect this event to be of interest to individuals from multiple researcher, industry and public communities.

Presentations were followed by a drinks and networking reception and the afternoon finished with a Public Lecture by David Spiegelhalter.

Mathematicians and engineers create image-processing and analysis algorithms, e.g. image reconstruction, image de-noising and restoration algorithms, methods for object segmentation and tracking, in particular in the presence of large-scale imaging data. At the MRRC, fluid-gas dynamics and chemical reactions are investigated using Magnetic Resonance Tomographic Imaging (MRI) as a visualisation and quantification technique. At the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, light microscopy and medical imaging are exciting research fields. A collaboration between microscopists and mathematicians e.g. leads to new ways of tracking and analyzing the effect of cancer drugs during mitosis. At the FM/HKI spectroscopy methods underpin the non-invasive analyses of materials and techniques, conservation and cross-disciplinary interpretation of paintings, illuminated manuscripts and Egyptian papyri.

The complex process, from acquiring images to their interpretation and problem-solving applications, requires multi-expertise partnerships. Different problems and image applications inform similar methodologies and interpretative strategies. Cross-disciplinary collaboration is needed to analyze the image-information not explicit in machine-generated data. For instance, in Magnetic Resonance Tomography, Positron Emission Tomography, microscopy imaging or seismic imaging, the combined expertise of mathematicians, engineers, computer scientists, medical doctors and geophysicists turns samples of Fourier-, Radon-transform data or electromagnetic waves into meaningful images of the brain, heart activity or ozone density in the atmosphere. Analyses of artist's materials and techniques, on the other hand, unite chemists, physicists, mathematicians, biologists, imaging scientists, conservators, artists and intellectual historians.
We aim to stimulate new inquiries and focused dialogues between the sciences, arts and humanities by providing them with a platform for communication.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.images.group.cam.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Mathematical imaging with partially unknown models, Jesus College in Cambridge, 20-21 Feb. 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB70B4EC-FC6E-47F6-AA2C-99300E42B05F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CCIMI and CMIH are pleased to be co-sponsoring the Cambridge - Heriot Watt interdisciplinary data science workshop on &amp;quot;Mathematical imaging with partially unknown models&amp;quot; at Jesus College in Cambridge, 20-21 Feb. 2017. More details on the programme will be confirmed at a later date.

The workshop is organised by Marcelo Pereyra (Assistant professor, School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot Watt) and Carola-Bibiane Sch&amp;ouml;nlieb (Head of the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information (CCIMI), Cambridge), alongside local organiser Martin Benning (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge)

The workshop aims to gather an interdisciplinary group of leading imaging experts from the applied analysis, statistics, and signal processing communities around the topic of &amp;quot;imaging with partially unknown models&amp;quot;. The goal is to promote synergy and cross-fertilisation between these communities and set the basis for a multidisciplinary approach to the problem.

Mathematical imaging is at the core of modern data science, with important applications in medicine, biology, defense, agriculture and environmental sciences. This active research field studies imaging inverse problems involving the estimation of an unobserved true image from measurements that are noisy, incomplete and resolution-limited. This proposal focuses on an increasingly important and particularly challenging class of imaging inverse problems that, in addition to being ill-posed and ill-conditioned, are further complicated by inaccurate and partial knowledge of the observation system and of the properties of the underlying true image (which are essential to regularise the problem and deliver meaningful estimates). These so-called &amp;quot;semi-blind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unsupervised&amp;quot; problems are the focus of significant research efforts across a range of scientific communities, particularly applied analysis, Bayesian statistics, and signal processing, which have recently produced important developments in mathematical theory, methods, models and efficient algorithms.

The proposed research workshop will focus on three specific aspects of imaging with partially unknown models that will be key in future methodology: learning models from observed data, model comparison and selection in the absence of ground truth, and robust inference with approximate models.

Objectives

1) Optimal transport has long standing connections to probability, which have been amplified in recent years. For example, variants of the classical optimal transport problem have arisen in connection to applications in financial mathematics (including transport problems with additional dependence constraints and martingale optimal transport, where versions with several, or even infinitely many, prescribed marginals are also of interest) and Schr&amp;ouml;dinger's problem of minimizing the relative entropy of stochastic processes with fixed initial and final laws. In addition, Wasserstein barycenters have recently been developed as a natural tool to average or interpolate among several probability measures, against the background geometry of optimal transport. This extends the celebrated notion of displacement interpolation between two measures, and has recently found many fruitful applications, in image processing, economics and statistics. Each of these problems brings forth significant new challenges, both theoretical and computational; in addition to addressing these, we have strong reasons to believe that bringing together leaders in optimal transport with experts in probability might uncover even more connections and will stimulate research on both sides.

2) The interest in multi-marginal optimal transport problems is also rapidly growing, driven in particular by its connection with density functional theory in quantum chemistry and fluid dynamics (Brenier's generalized solutions of incompressibe Euler). Understanding the structure, regularity and sparsity properties of optimal plans for multi-marginal transport problems is a very active and challenging area of research. Fast numerical solvers yet are still to be found to address these typically very high-dimensional problems. One of our goals in gathering specialists of optimal transport (both theoretical and computational), probability and statistics in a broad sense is to better understand how, for instance, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods could help overcome such a computational bottleneck. 

3) As outlined above, OT methods are rapidly developing in statistics and econometrics, one reason-among many others being for instance that the Brenier's map may be viewed as one of the most natural multivariate extensions of the notion of quantile. Statistical inference based on Wasserstein distances is therefore becoming more and more popular. However, there are few rigorous limit theorems (apart from the real line case) which fully justify its use and one aim of this workshop is to make progress on such delicate issues which intimately connect probability, analysis and the geometry of Wasserstein spaces.

4)Representation of datasets, classification and measurement of similarities/disparities between complex data or objects such as images or collection of histograms are ubiquitous problems in machine learning. Optimal transport based distances are used more and more frequently to address these questions. For instance in principal component analysis (PCA) one aims to approximate in the most accurate way a large cloud of points by a small dimensional manifold and geodesic Wasserstein PCA is becoming a popular tool for large collections of histograms. Another important problem is metric learning which can somehow be viewed as a sort of inverse transport problem: what can be infered on the distance between objects given an observed coupling between them? Bringing specialists of questions using optimal transport methods, it is our hope to have a clearer picture and better geometric and analytic understanding on the performances and complexity of computational OT based methods in machine learning.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-workshops/17w5093</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Big Data Showcase event in Cambridge on Seeing More in Images: A Mathematical Perspective</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93EA951C-66FB-471D-A2BB-94CF31CD113F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Background

Mathematics underpins so many things we take for granted - smart phones, weather forecasting, architecture, 3D software, structural engineering, sensing technologies, are just a few examples. Indeed, the fruits of mathematical research - such as the resulting techniques and algorithms, affect the daily lives of everyone and the economic impact of mathematics is already well proven.

The University of Cambridge's Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS) and Big Data Initiative, in partnership with the Turing Gateway to Mathematics highlighted areas of research and expertise in a showcase event, that took place on Wednesday 20th April 2016 at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Wilberforce Road, Cambridge.

A wide range of talks were given by leading researchers, highlighting areas of mathematical and Big Data sciences. An exhibition ran during the lunch break and the afternoon session. The day ended with a drinks and networking reception between 5.00-6.00PM.

The Showcase presented a great opportunity to see what Cambridge has to offer and better understand the diversity and impact that the research in mathematics and big data at Cambridge can make on business and policy across a wide range of areas. Researchers were on hand to discuss specific areas of maths and big data and there was opportunities for delegates to take tours of the GK Batchelor Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and also see the COSMOS Computer. The exhibition included research groups, industrial case studies posters, the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Analysis, the new Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information and details of project opportunities for industry.

Aims and Objectives

Subjects of talks included industrial areas such as materials and chemical decontamination, mathematical biology, financial maths, cosmology, communications and social sciences. The Showcase presented an excellent opportunity to bring together scientists from mathematics and other disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering etc, with interested parties from industry, government and public sectors.

The Showcase gave participants a great opportunity to:

Meet leading mathematicians and other scientists involved in state-of-the-art mathematical techniques and methods across multiple areas including Big Data
Learn more about the potential of mathematics to help provide solutions to real-world problems
Find out how to collaborate and partner with the University through research, projects and studentships

This event was one of a number of scientific scoping workshops funded by the Alan Turing Institute. These workshops have helped to define the research programme at the Alan Turing Institute, whose mission is to undertake data science research at the intersection of computer science, mathematics, statistics and systems engineering. It aims to provide technically informed advice to policy makers and enable researchers from industry and academia to work together towards practical applications and solutions.

Partial differential equations (PDE) are equations involving functions and their derivatives - they have applications in the natural and social sciences, engineering, computer science and economics. Today they have found their way into the data sciences, in a variety of ways. PDE models are used directly, for example for data assimilation, image processing, image analysis, shape analysis, inverse problems, computer vision, and modelling complex phenomena such as crowd motion, opinion formation, and option pricing. PDE ideas also serve as an inspiration to formulate and solve data problems on graphs and networks, such as in the use of graph-discretised PDE for various classification and community detection problems, and in the application of Gamma-convergence to link graph and continuum variational classification models (which is crucial for analysing these models and for understanding their scalability).
Aims and Objectives

This workshop brought together expert mathematicians and statisticians, working on nonlinear, nonlocal, and stochastic PDE models and on large, complex network problems, with industrial and academic data science users. By encouraging discussion among the participants in informal presentations and breakout sessions, it helped identify the most promising research directions combining PDE and data science.

Some of the key scientific questions addressed were:

Identification of the most promising directions of novel PDE approaches in data science
Which data science problems are appropriate for PDE techniques
Which numerical PDE based approaches can lead to scalable algorithms that are applicable to very large data sets
The use of model based PDE or variational inverse problems for dimension reduction (simplification!) of high dimensional data sets
Pinpointing simple, analysable PDE models capable of describing complex data phenomena (e.g. pattern formation, aggregation, transport, drift, diffusion)
Using stochastic PDEs to assimilate new data into existing nonlinear or nonlocal models
The workshop brought together industrial and academic experts from a diverse set of backgrounds. It explored the potential of PDEs in data science areas, such as data assimilation, data analytics and topological data analysis. This event will be of particular interest to those from the following identified application areas.

In this project we have developed novel analysis and reconstruction techniques based on the minimisation of non-smooth energies and the solution of nonlinear and higher-order partial differential equations. These methods are designed for image enhancement, image segmentation, image inpainting, image reconstruction from under sampled indirect measurements (medical imaging, remote sensing), image classification, object tracking and motion estimation, just to name a few. We have contributed to:

1) The development of new models in this regime
2) The mathematical analysis of solutions to these models, providing reconstruction guarantees and qualitative properties of solutions. This is in particular challenging in the context of nonlinear inverse problems (i.e. nonlinear relations between measurements and image information extracted).
3) The efficient and reliable computational solution in the context of large-scale and possible high-dimensional image data.

More explicitly we have developed:
- A converging computational scheme for depth from focus reconstruction in which the model for computing an depth image from differently focused photographs is a nonlinear one.
- An operator splitting approach with convergence guarantees for the solutions of nonlinear inverse imaging problems.
- Analysis and computational methods - based on quasi- and semi-smooth Newton schemes - of bilevel learning approaches for image models based on the minimisation of non-smooth energies.
- Development of efficient numerical methods for large-scale inverse problems in medical imaging. We developed new algorithms that successfully exploit the problem structure in positron emission tomography (PET) and thereby allow state-of-the-art mathematical modelling to be used in a clinical setting. Moreover, we worked on the mathematical modelling of a-priori knowledge in a multi-modality or multi-channel setting which for instance leads to faster data acquisition for multi-contrast MRI.
- We have developed both theory, algorithms and applications for spectral decomposition of nonlinear operators: we have successfully developed a framework to create realistic image fusions of individual images of two faces with a mathematical method called spectral decomposition. We have developed theoretical justifications for the underlying non-linear spectral decomposition and an algorithm that is able to solve this nonlinear problem in a robust and efficient way.
- We have been exploring an anisotropic (and hence non-convex) variational model for a structure preserving interpolation of large-scale sparse data (e.g. point cloud data or level lines of a surface that are far apart) with applications in compression for digital elevation maps, point cloud data processing and atomic force microscopy.
- We have developed a new video inpainting algorithm called Guidefill, tailored to the unique needs of inpainting as it applies to 3D conversion of high-definition videos, which is the generation of a stereo left and right eye pair of images/videos from a single image/video.&amp;nbsp; Guidefill operates frame by frame for the sake of speed and keeps the user in the loop, with a mechanism to influence the results of inpainting.
- We have proposed an anisotropic particle model for the simulation of artificial fingerprints, which are ubiquitous for the development of fingerprint classification methods applied to large databases.
- Development of image analysis methods for the analysis of large light microscopy samples of mitotic cells for cancer research.
- Development of an efficient numerical method for the segmentation of LiDAR data with a graph clustering approach with applications in forest ecology for the delineation of individual trees in remote sensing data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of the project are made available to the scientific community.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging technique that allows different contrasts depending on the acquisition parameters. Many clinical imaging studies acquire MRI data for more than one of these contrasts---such as for instance T1 and T2 weighted images---which makes the overall scanning procedure very time consuming. As all of these images show the same underlying anatomy one can try to omit unnecessary measurements by taking the similarity into account during reconstruction. We will discuss two modifications of total variation---based on i) location and ii) direction---that take structural a priori knowledge into account and reduce to total variation in the degenerate case when no structural knowledge is available. We solve the resulting convex minimization problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers that separates the forward operator from the prior. For both priors the corresponding proximal operator can be implemented as an extension of the fast gradient projection method on the dual problem for total variation. We tested the priors on six data sets that are based on phantoms and real MRI images. In all test cases exploiting the structural information from the other contrast yields better results than separate reconstruction with total variation in terms of standard metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. Furthermore, we found that exploiting the two dimensional directional information results in images with well defined edges, superior to those reconstructed solely using a priori information about the edge location.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CD070A6-0928-4254-95BB-761E7879B0AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Software for joint-reconstruction for multi contrast MRI</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction with Structure-Guided Total Variation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/software/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Abstract: We are presenting a modification of the well-known Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with additional preconditioning that aims at solving convex optimisation problems with nonlinear operator constraints.
