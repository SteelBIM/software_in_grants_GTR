This research focuses on the insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), a growth promoting protein that is present at high levels on the surface of cancer cells, enabling them to survive and spread through tissues. Our research shows that depleting cells of IGFR, using a molecular technique called gene silencing, makes cancer cells easier to kill by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This effect has proved to be associated with impaired function of a large nuclear protein called ATM, which orchestrates the response to DNA damage. It is unclear how the IGFR at the cell surface can influence ATM function, although it probably involves one or more of the signalling proteins that are activated by the IGFR. Preliminary studies have identified two such candidate mediators, and this research is investigating how these are linked to the function of ATM. Understanding this process will reveal how cancer cells coordinate growth and DNA repair, and will enable us to use more effectively the IGFR inhibitors that are becoming available as novel cancer therapeutics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis is a key mediator of tumour cell growth and survival. We have demonstrated a previously-unrecognised link between IGF signalling and activation of ATM, the product of the gene mutated in patients with the rare genetic disorder Ataxia Telangiectasia. ATM is a serine-threonine kinase that plays a central role in coordination of the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. Murine melanoma cells in which the type 1 IGF receptor (IGF1R) was stably downregulated showed enhanced sensitivity to ionising radiation, reduced phosphorylation of p53 and radioresistant DNA synthesis. Furthermore levels of Atm protein were reduced, due to reduction in rates of translation and of protein half-life, and there was impaired activation of the Atm kinase following DNA damage. This phenotype has been recapitulated in human breast cancer cells in which the IGF1R was stably knocked down by IGF1R short hairpin RNA. We hypothesise that IGF signalling is required, perhaps by inducing changes in ATM localisation and/or post-translational modification, in order for ATM to be activated by DNA damage. This proposal will investigate how the IGF receptor is capable of influencing the function and localisation of ATM. Preliminary data from gene-specific knock-downs implicate the IGF1R docking protein insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and the kinase AKT2 in mediating this link, and suggest that IRS-1 can interact with ATM. Initial experiments will determine whether these molecules function in a linear signalling pathway downstream of the IGF1R, or whether IRS-1 may regulate the location and/or function of ATM via a chaperone function, as has been described between IRS-1 and RAD51. If the latter, we will investigate which domains of IRS-1 and ATM interact using deletion mutants and peptide arrays. Should IRS-1 function to transduce a signal from the IGF1R to AKT2, we will assess whether AKT2 itself or an AKT effector is responsible for influencing ATM. Finally we will use proteomic techniques, including 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectroscopy, to investigate whether the IGF/AKT axis is capable of phosphorylating ATM in vitro and in vivo. The functional significance of any defined modifications will be tested in intact cells by expressing mutant ATM proteins, and measuring effects on ATM localisation, kinase activity and protein stability. The elucidation of the molecular basis of the link between the IGF1R and ATM will shed light on a fundamental connection between the regulation of cell survival and the DNA damage response.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>477784</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Sciences Division</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biochemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>Investigation of IGF-1R function</gtr:description><gtr:id>94DB0170-E307-48B0-A5F5-6E6A68B59D4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication Aleksic et al 2010 (PubMed ID 20710042).

The collaboration with AstraZeneca provided chemical inhibitors for study of IGF-1R, and this led to the award of an AZ research grant for the project outlined above.

The collaboration with MH led to a successful grant application for which MH is the applicant and VM is named collaborator. This will involve experimental work in both the MH and VM laboratories, to characterize IGF-1R trafficking.

Note added Nov 2011: significant progress has been made with both projects generated by our MRC grant of 2007-2010:

1) Ongoing investigation of the function of nuclear IGF-1R has led to a recently-submitted CRUK project grant application (October 2011 round). This project continues to use IGF-1R inhibitor supplied via collaboration with AstraZeneca, and also involves collaboration with Dr Eric O'Neill, Dept of Oncology Oxford, Prof Freddie Hamdy, Nuffield Dept of Surgical Sciences Oxford (access to prostate cancer tissue), Dr Clare Verrill, Dept of Pathology Oxford (histopathology expertise) and Mr Steve Taylor, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine (WIMM) Oxford (bioinformatics expertise).

2) The collaboration with Breakthrough Breast Cancer has made good progress with the validation of hits identified in a screen for proteins that regulate sensitivity to IGF-1R inhibition. We have focused on one specific hit, and will explore this in ongoing collaboration with Alan Ashworth and Chris Lord at Breakthrough. We aim to submit a manuscript describing this work in the first half of 2012. The project has been supported on soft money after AstraZeneca funding ceased in Oct 2010. We are currently preparing an application to the Molecular and Cellular Medicine Board of the MRC (January 2012 round) to support ongoing work on this project. Professor Ashworth has provided a letter of support to confirm collaboration and support (scientific advice and preclinical modelling), and AstraZeneca has guaranteed to supply of their IGF-1R inhibitor for this project, and confirmed this in a letter and MICA form for the MCMB application.

Note added Nov 2013: we were unsuccessful in the application for MRC funding mentioned in the above note, but we succeeded in gaining funding from the Breast Cancer Campaign.

On one occasion in early 2009, one of my prostate cancer patients made a more prolonged visit to the laboratory, spoke to each member of my group and discussed their research.

The fundraisers often comment that these visits increase their energy and enthusiasm for fundraising activities. The visit of one individual gave this patient the opportunity to discuss in more depth the progress in research relevant to prostate cancer. Importantly, this visit also had a profoundly motivating effect on the scientists in the lab, who had not previously met patients with metastatic cancer.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2006,2007,2008,2009,2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Renal Cancer Support Group</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>01F2821D-D01F-42AC-9F85-2DEFD07F2A83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>With the support of a specialist urology nurse, the renal cancer patients in Oxford have formed a support group, FROG, that meets monthly for discussion about renal cancer and its treatment.

The database and tissue collection are underpinned by permission from the National Research Ethics Committee (NREC), and the Urology collection forms part of the Oxford Research BioBank (ORB). The database is managed by a dedicated Urology Database Manager, and the material is available to Uro-Oncology research groups within Oxford.</gtr:description><gtr:id>32A14277-0144-4707-ABF4-FC100C5057AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Material available through the Oxford Urology Database contributed to publications from my group: PubMed nos. 17486080, 17645417, 20710042, 20840329 and to publications from others in the Uro-Oncology team in Oxford, eg 19962921, 19930178, 17574616.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Oxford Urology Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of Data/Biological Samples</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17486080</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>During the time that my own salary was part-funded by my MRC grant (2007-2010), I made a significant contribution to the decision to set up a GCP Laboratory, separate from the Oncology research labs, in order to conduct assays for monitoring of clinical trials. This facility was set up in 2009 in the Old Road Campus Research Building on the Churchill Hospital campus, and my group has been a major user. Taking our lab assays as a starting point, we have developed and validated assays to GCP, to monitor IGF-AKT-mTOR pathway activity. These assays are being applied to clinical samples in patients treated with new drugs targeting this pathway.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5EF37C27-BF41-4DE9-B2B5-F000EDAAD77F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The GCP
