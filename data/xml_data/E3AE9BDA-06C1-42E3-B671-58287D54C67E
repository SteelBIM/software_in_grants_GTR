One influential movement within this debate is that which has been called 'left-libertarianism'. Left-libertarians attempt to synthesise our moral intuitions about both freedom and equality, demonstrating that the two concepts need not conflict, as ideological debate in the past has often suggested. Two principles are foundational in left-libertarian theory: first, that individuals have rights against interference by others; second, that no individuals have any special claims to the world's resources, and that the world's resources should therefore be shared out equally amongst everyone. According to left-libertarians, everyone should receive an endowment of resources at the start of their lives, or a basic income throughout their lives, representing their share of the world's resources. \n\nOur project, Sharing Nature's Bounty, aims to clarify the moral case for the left-libertarian endowments proposal and to explore its political implications, seeking to bridge the gap between theory and practice. We will provide a philosophical articulation and defence of the underlying left-libertarian moral commitment to equality, and show what sort of equal endowment of resources is most suitable for the realisation of that commitment. We will ask how to determine the appropriate size of the proposed endowment, and whether individuals should receive a one-off endowment at the start of their lives, or a basic income throughout their lives.\n\nUnlike many other studies of its kind, this project aims to go beyond the traditional scope of philosophical discussions to examine the political implications of the equal endowment policy proposed. In particular, we will focus on the extent to which left-libertarian proposals require government taxation, and consider how such taxation should be implemented. We will focus particular attention on the implications of our research for global justice, examining how the endowments proposal could be implemented at the international level.\n\nThe project will involve two Investigators at the University of Exeter and a PhD student, also based at Exeter. It aims to answer important questions within contemporary political philosophy, to build capacity in this area of research, to develop networks around the project themes, and to promote the professional development of those participating in the project.\n\nThe project also aims to develop the use our research in real-world policy making decisions. In order to acheive this aim, in addition to the academic articles and two manuscripts that we will publish, we will also write articles for publications with more general readerships such as The Economist magazine and The New Statesman. We will hold annual workshops and a large final-year conference involving participants from academia and beyond, including policy makers, think tanks and civil-society organisations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>152675</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Departmental collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE02B79C-54E7-4BCB-A6EA-D78411319C31</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>The project strengthened a nascent partnership between the PI and Co-I, which developed into a strong collaborative relationship through the project.

2. Details the significant impacts felt both for academic research on justice The research has already had a significant impact on academic debates about justice through its published findings, and through dissemination at conferences and at the high-profile project workshops, attended by leading contributors to the field. Further impacts are expected as more of the projects findings are published. Key impacts on academic debates are as follows:
i. The overwhelmingly popular view that it is possible to reconcile freedom and equality in an overall theory of justice has been undermined, opening up deep and important questions about how it is that we can maintain an intuitive commitment to both these values.
ii. Longstanding views about the nature of, and underlying grounds for, popular left-libertarian and luck-egalitarian theories of justice have been questioned, with the result that debate about these issues has been reopened.
iii. A clearer understanding of the nature of consent, and the scope of its power to legitimize, has informed thinking in applied areas such as rape law.

3. In June 2012 the project is organising a policy-focused conference that has already become a very high profile event attracting widespread interest. It will make a major contribution to shaping both public and political debate and informing policymaking about how to design policies that are fair, sensitive to issues of responsibility, and effective in overcoming inequality. The conference aims to foster ongoing collaborations that will maximize the social impact of the research. The project is hosting in June 2012 a major public conference, to which leading parliamentarians, policymakers, thinktanks and academic have been invited, to discuss the impacts of its research for public policy. The PI is working closely with the public policy manager and the press office at the AHRC to maximise the impact of the conference on shaping public debate and policy. Details of the conference are as follows:
In the wake of the financial crisis there has been a renewed interested in issues of fairness and responsibility. But what do these notions really mean? And how should they be applied to the social issues of our time? At same time there is concern at the increase in social and economic inequality, both nationally and globally. Which types of inequality ought be of primary concern, and what can be done about them? How does the recent emphasis on fairness and responsibility fit with the aim of reducing inequality? Can appeals to such notions help to reduce inequality, or do they detract from such efforts? What role ought such notions play in international efforts to reduce poverty and encourage development?

4. Talk based on project research on what equality of opportunity requires in terms of policies for people with disabilities, hosted by March of Dimes Canada, Canada's leading disability advocacy organisation Shaped public debate by describing new perspectives on equality of opportunity for people with disabilities</gtr:description><gtr:id>517507CD-AB90-47D0-B26C-2659CD1F4C65</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project sought to examine the nature of, and grounds for, a commitment to equality and freedom in popular 'left-libertarian' theories of justice. It further sought to describe how such commitments ought be implemented in matters of public policy. The key findings of the project are as follows:



1. Dominant theories of justice including left-libertarianism and so-called 'luck egalitarianism' claim that it is possible to incorporate both a commitment to equality and a commitment to freedom within an overall theory of justice. The project demonstrates that those who think such a reconciliation possible misunderstand the moral nature of freedom, or equality, or both. This finding has led to important and potentially revisionary new insights about how political philosophers should use 'intuitions' to support principled claims, to be pursued further by Dr. Hyams in a Leverhulme-funded fellowship commencing October 2012.



2. A commitment to freedom is best understood as a commitment to the legitimising power of consent and the protective power of rights. Current theories of the scope of consent's power to legitimise are seriously inadequate: a new theory was described.



3. Left-libertarians claim that agents are entitled to an equal endowment of resources at the start of their lives. This claim can be grounded in a conception of equality of opportunity, a constituent of justice. The conception of equality of opportunity requires constraints on permissible inheritance. Nevertheless, justice is not exhausted by the provision of an initial endowment of resources or by constraints on inheritance: it also makes other demands, as detailed in the following key findings. 



4. The model of equality of opportunity required by justice requires changes to the model of equality of opportunity that dominates present policymaking. In particular, a just conception of equality of opportunity requires not only that people have an equal opportunity to pursue positions of advantage, but also that inequalities between available positions themselves be diminished.



5. Justice requires that people be provided with the opportunity to insure against any significant risks that they face later on in their lives. It is unfair that agents suffer unequally at the hands of risks that they would prefer to avoid and are unable to insure against. The project provides a novel explanation of this unfairness.



6. In order to better meet the challenges posed by justice, current approaches to taxation and public services would have to be reformed in significant ways. Various options for reform, which would better achieve the requirements of justice whilst maintaining economic growth, were examined. The project also explored how the requirements of justice could be met at the international level through reforms to international aid and development practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In the wake of the financial crisis, questions about fairness, inequality and responsibility have taken centre stage in government. The findings of the research project speak directly to these political debates, with particular significance for government policy in the areas of social and economic equality, public services and tax, and poverty prevention. These themes will be explored in depth at a conference in June 2012, which has already engaged considerable high-profile interest. The conference brings the PI, Co-I and project PhD student together with leading parliamentarians, policymakers and senior representatives of influential political think-tanks, including Rachel Reeves MP, Will Hutton, The Equality Trust, The Fabian Society, Institute for Public Policy Research, Oxfam, Overseas Development Institute, Social Research Unit, and the Policy Network.



Considerations of both fairness and consent are at the heart of a number of further policy issues.
