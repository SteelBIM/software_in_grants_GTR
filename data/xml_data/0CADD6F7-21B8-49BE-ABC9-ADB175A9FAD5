(BALI)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K016253/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Anthropogenic disturbance and land-use change in the tropics is leading to irrevocable changes in biodiversity and substantial shifts in ecosystem biogeochemistry. Yet, we still have a poor understanding of how human-driven changes in biodiversity feed back to alter biogeochemical processes. This knowledge gap substantially restricts our ability to model and predict the response of tropical ecosystems to current and future environmental change. There are a number of critical challenges to our understanding of how changes in biodiversity may alter ecosystem processes in the tropics; namely: (i) how the high taxonomic diversity of the tropics is linked to ecosystem functioning, (ii) how changes in the interactions among trophic levels and taxonomic groups following disturbance impacts upon functional diversity and biogeochemistry, and (iii) how plot-level measurements can be used to scale to whole landscapes. We have formed a consortium to address these critical challenges to launch a large-scale, replicated, and fully integrated study that brings together a multi-disciplinary team with the skills and expertise to study the necessary taxonomic and trophic groups, different biogeochemical processes, and the complex interactions amongst them.

To understand and quantify the effects of land-use change on the activity of focal biodiversity groups and how this impacts biogeochemistry, we will: (i) analyse pre-existing data on distributions of focal biodiversity groups; (ii) sample the landscape-scale treatments at the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project site (treatments include forest degradation, fragmentation, oil palm conversion) and key auxiliary sites (Maliau Basin - old growth on infertile soils, Lambir Hills - old growth on fertile soils, Sabah Biodiversity Experiment - rehabilitated forest, INFAPRO-FACE - rehabilitated forest); and (iii) implement new experiments that manipulate key components of biodiversity and pathways of belowground carbon flux. 

The manipulations will focus on trees and lianas, mycorrhizal fungi, termites and ants, because these organisms are the likely agents of change for biogeochemical cycling in human-modified tropical forests. We will use a combination of cutting-edge techniques to test how these target groups of organisms interact each other to affect biogeochemical cycling. We will additionally collate and analyse archived data on other taxa, including vertebrates of conservation concern. The key unifying concept is the recognition that so-called 'functional traits' play a key role in linking taxonomic diversity to ecosystem function. We will focus on identifying key functional traits associated with plants, and how they vary in abundance along the disturbance gradient at SAFE. In particular, we propose that leaf functional traits (e.g. physical and chemical recalcitrance, nitrogen content, etc.) play a pivotal role in determining key ecosystem processes and also strongly influence atmospheric composition. Critically, cutting-edge airborne remote sensing techniques suggest it is possible to map leaf functional traits, chemistry and physiology at landscape-scales, and so we will use these novel airborne methods to quantify landscape-scale patterns of forest degradation, canopy structure, biogeochemical cycling and tree distributions. Process-based mathematical models will then be linked to the remote sensing imagery and ground-based measurements of functional diversity and biogeochemical cycling to upscale our findings over disturbance gradients.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries will include the policy makers associated with the development of REDD+ schemes (including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [UNCCC] and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC]), forest managers at company and State level, the oil palm industry, academic institutions in Malaysia, and the conservation sector globally.

REDD+ policy: Results from this project will provide information of key relevance to the management and monitoring of degraded forests within REDD+ schemes. In particular this work will quantify the impacts of habitat degradation and change on belowground biodiversity and processes and develop a series of robust indicators, which can be developed into effective monitoring strategies to assess forest degradation and recovery. REDD+ policy is of particular importance given UNFCCC COP negotiations in Doha in December 2012. The UNFCCC are active in developing guidance for REDD+, and REDD+ is one of the hottest topics in development of the IPCC chapter on Agriculture Forestry and Other Land Use. 

Forest Managers: Belowground processes are key to sustainable forest management. The development of user-friendly survey techniques will allow timber industries to assess the impacts of existing management options more fully. |In particular the project will allow assessment of key strategies for aiding forest recovery; crucial for sustainable timber production in the region.

Oil palm industry: The increasing focus of the global oil palm industry on corporate social responsibility and the development of more sustainable management practices through schemes such as the RSPO, has precipitated a growing need for robust monitoring of belowground processes associated with sustainable oil palm production. The indicators developed in this project will be key to this and will facilitate the monitoring of these processes in a plantation context for the first time.

Academic institutions in Malaysia: Despite a growing body of biodiversity research in the region, the biodiversity of Southeast Asia, particularly that of belowground components, remains relatively little studied. Such a knowledge gap can act as a barrier for continued ecological research in the region. This project will provide detailed information on species data for belowground systems. 

Conservation sector: The growth of tropical agriculture represents the major threat to biodiversity globally. However, conservation organizations are sometimes hampered in their ability to converse with government policy makers, through lack of detailed information about the impacts of habitat change. This project will fill a knowledge gap in this area and provide detailed data on the impacts of habitat change on below ground biodiversity and ecosystem processes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1341827</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Designed and contributed ideas towards the BALI consortium logo.</gtr:description><gtr:id>573C5633-16CC-4B0D-B958-D0869377A1F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Promoting the project and its aims.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>BALI logo</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bali.hmtf.info</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Universiti Malaysia Sabah</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malaysia</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute for Tropical Biology and Conservation (ITBC), Malaysia</gtr:description><gtr:id>51668FAC-298F-4216-A71A-E5AA00C66C49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>4 postgraduate studentships awarded to scholars through Universiti Malaysia Sabah, working in collaboration with the SAFE project and SEARRP.

Members of the BALI consortium have also contributed to the development of sustainable management strategies for the oil palm industry. For example, PIs Burslem and Teh provided expert opinions, input, and advice on a technical report for the RSPO which helps define best-practice guidelines for conserving carbon in oil palm landscapes and mitigating climate change. The final report is entitled &amp;quot;The High Carbon Stock Science Study: Independent Report from the Technical Committee.&amp;quot;

PUBLIC OUTREACH
Researchers from BALI have participated in a number of public outreach events, including presentations to the general public, primary and secondary schools, and training (capacity building) events within their host countries. For example, BALI team members were involved in a Nature Live Public Lecture at the Natural History Museum, open day events throughout the UK (e.g. Doors Open Day in Aberdeen), guest lectures at primary and secondary schools in Malaysia and elsewhere, and training of local research assistants and volunteers on invertebrate identification and dung beetle sampling (BALI and LOMBOK). 

MULTIMEDIA
Members of the BALI consortium, LOMBOK, and SEARRP have jointly produced a short film specifically focusing on the Malaysian part of the HMTF programme to showcase our research and objectives. Educational videos on biogeochemical cycling, mammals, invertebrate dispersal, leeches, dung beetles, and birds are also being developed. The films are geared towards the general public and will be displayed on the HMTF consortia websites and disseminated via social networks (www.hmtf.info).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D74B2BC5-BD3E-4D3D-B0CB-B3159A28BD1D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Plant trait campaign: After completing the BALI plant trait field campaign at the end of 2015, the majority of plant material analyses have now been completed. A subsample of dried plant material and frozen leaf discs were exported to the University of Aberdeen in order to measure isotope concentrations, specifically 13C and 15N. Currently underway are analyses extracting phenol and tannin concentrations. The results to date show a vast magnitude and diversity of plant functional traits expressed in the forests in Sabah, specifically in Maliau Basin, Danum Valley and the SAFE project sites. Preliminary results show a significantly higher concentration of leaf phosphorus content found in trees of old-growth forests. Similarly, concentrations of Ca, Mg, K were revealed to be significantly higher in Maliau Basin and Danum Valley compared to trees of the SAFE project sites. A total of 315 tree species were studied and their trait variability will now be analysed in the context of land-use change. Specifically the studies will shed light on the detailed characterization of plant traits expressed in forests in Borneo as well as the impact of selective logging on the trait diversity.

Remotely sensed hyperspectral data: Remotely sensed hyperspectral data has been obtained as part of the BALI project in 2014. The data from Maliau, SAFE and Danum has been atmospherically corrected and prepared for further downstream analysis. A post-doctoral researcher has been appointed at the Coomes group at University of Cambridge to lead the further analysis of the data. 

Manipulative experiments at Maliau and SAFE including the assessment of leaf litter decomposition: The team of Dr Sabine Both is currently finalising the publication of the results gathered from the leaf litter decomposition experiment, which was conducted in Maliau Basin and SAFE project sites in November 2014 - April 2015. Given the widespread human-modified tropical landscape with selectively logged forest replacing old-growth forest at high rates, it is vital to understand the consequences for decomposition. It is unknown to what extent the extraordinary species diversity interact, not only for plants but also in microbial and invertebrate communities, and the qualitative effect of complex environmental conditions. The multifactorial experiment was established in order to test the effect of land-use change, i.e. the transition from old-growth forest to selectively logged forest, on decomposition and nutrient cycling. Leaf litter mass loss of two contrasting leaf litter types was determined after 24 weeks and the change in chemical composition analysed at the end of the experiment in relation to the initial chemistry. The results show that litter decomposition was mainly driven by land-use and not litter quality. There was a very strong difference between chemical composition of leaf litter locally collected in areas of Maliau Basin and the SAFE project, with the latter showing significantly lower concentration of nutrients, for example phosphorus and calcium. However, despite these substantial differences in chemical litter properties, the main driver was not litter chemical composition but land-use type. Compared to old-growth forest, decomposition in selectively logged was significantly lower. The results show clearly that selective logging negatively affects decomposition rates in tropical rainforests.

Girdling experiment: All pre- and post- girdling sampling work has been completed. However, access to the site is still required for potential post-girdling sampling (&amp;gt; 6 months effect) and access to equipment/facilities at site.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope support the dissemination of project results by:
