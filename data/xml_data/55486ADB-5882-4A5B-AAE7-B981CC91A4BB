Analytics</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N017064/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>National infrastructure provides essential services to a modern economy: energy, transport, digital communications, water supply, flood protection, and waste water / solid waste collection, treatment and disposal. The OECD estimates that globally US$53 trillion of infrastructure investment will be needed by 2030. The UK's National Infrastructure Plan set out over &amp;pound;460 billion of investment in the next decade, but is not yet known what effect that investment will have on the quality and reliability of national infrastructure services, the size of the economy, the resilience of society or its impacts upon the environment. Such a gap in knowledge exists because of the sheer complexity of infrastructure networks and their interactions with people and the environment. That means that there is too much guesswork, and too many untested assumptions in the planning, appraisal and design of infrastructure, from European energy networks to local drainage systems. 

Our vision is for infrastructure decisions to be guided by systems analysis. When this vision is realised, decision makers will have access to, and visualisation of, information that tells them how all infrastructure systems are performing. They will have models that help to pinpoint vulnerabilities and quantify the risks of failure. They will be able to perform 'what-if' analysis of proposed investments and explore the effects of future uncertainties, such as population growth, new technologies and climate change.

The UK Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (ITRC) is a consortium of seven UK universities, led by the University of Oxford, which has developed unique capability in infrastructure systems analysis, modelling and decision making. Thanks to an EPSRC Programme Grant (2011-2015) the ITRC has developed and demonstrated the world's first family of national infrastructure system models (NISMOD) for analysis and long-term planning of interdependent infrastructure systems. The research is already beng used by utility companies, engineering consultants, the Institution of Civil Engineers and many parts of the UK government, to analyse risks and inform billions of pounds worth of better infrastructure decisions. Infrastructure UK is now using NISMOD to analyse the National Infrastructure Plan.

The aim of MISTRAL is to develop and demonstrate a highly integrated analytics capability to inform strategic infrastructure decision making across scales, from local to global. MISTRAL will thereby radically extend infrastructure systems analysis capability:
- Downscale: from ITRC's pioneering representation of national networks to the UK's 25.7 million households and 5.2 million businesses, representing the infrastructure services they demand and the multi-scale networks through which these services are delivered.
- Upscale: from the national perspective to incorporate global interconnections via telecommunications, transport and energy networks.
- Across-scale: to other national settings outside the UK, where infrastructure needs are greatest and where systems analysis represents a huge business opportunity for UK engineering firms.
These research challenges urgently need to be tackled because infrastructure systems are interconnected across scales and prolific technological innovation is now occurring that will exploit, or may threaten, that interconnectedness. MISTRAL will push the frontiers of system research in order to quantify these opportunities and risks, providing the evidence needed to plan, invest in and design modern, sustainable and resilient infrastructure services.

Five years ago, proposing theory, methodology and network models that stretched from the household to the globe, and from the UK to different national contexts would not have been credible. Now the opportunity for multi-scale modelling is coming into sight, and ITRC, perhaps uniquely, has the capacity and ambition to take on that challenge in the MISTRAL programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of MISTRAL is to develop and demonstrate the next generation of models, methods and tools that are needed to inform strategic infrastructure system decision making across scales from local to global. The decision makers who are responsible for strategic infrastructure planning, investment and design, work in government departments, regulators, utility companies and their consultants. This includes organisations like Infrastructure UK, Department for Transport, DECC, the Committee on Climate Change, Ofcom, the Environment Agency, RWE, BP, Shell, National Grid, Network Rail, Thames Water, SITA, CH2M, KPMG, JBA and Volterra, who are all partners in MISTRAL.

MISTRAL is intended to provide decision makers with insights that hitherto have not been available to inform crucial questions: How will infrastructure systems perform in the context of major future changes like population growth, technological change and climate change? What would be the benefits of investing in new infrastructure capacity or of endeavouring to manage demand for infrastructure services? Where are the most vulnerable points in infrastructure networks? How much is it worth investing to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure? We are answering some of these questions already, based on ITRC's first Programme Grant; for example identifying critical points in the transport network following the disruptive weather in the winter of 2013/14; and analysing the benefits of the &amp;pound;460billion of investments in the National Infrastructure Plan. MISTRAL will extend our analytical capability across different scales of decision making, thereby also helping to inform decision makers in devolved administrations and local authorities. With increasing devolution of decision making powers, organisations like the Greater London Authority, Transport for London, Newcastle City Council and Transport for Greater Manchester are taking increasing responsibility for infrastructure planning. We aim to have MISTRAL's infastructure system analytics being used and informing decisions by governments, utilities and regulators at a range of scales in the UK.

MISTRAL looks upscale to understand the interdependencies between UK infrastructure systems, the EU and the world. This is of particular importance in the energy, transport, telecommunications and waste sectors. Global infrastructure networks are also of great interest to the European Investment Bank and other international investors, OECD and insurers such as Willis and Zurich Re. We will work with UK knowledge-based businesses, such as Arup and Atkins, to strengthen comparative advantage in the global infrastructure market. We aim for MISTRAL's capabilities to be used in infrastructure planning, design and analysis around the world. By working in countries like China and the UAE, where huge sums are being invested in infrastructure, we will seek to inform infrastructure decisions and demonstrate how infrastructure systems could be steered towards more sustainable outcomes. By working with the UN's infrastructure organisation, UNOPS, we intend to improve post-disaster and post-conflict infrastructure planning.

Technologies companies like Microsoft, Siemens and Improbable Worlds also want to be involved in MISTRAL because of the new datasets we will assemble, the new analytical methods we will develop and the glimpses that the research might provide of the future. We for MISTRAL's national infrastructure database to become a shared national resource, and a focal point for research and industrial collaboration.

Ultimately, consumers of infrastructure services will benefit from infrastructure systems that are more efficient, reliable, resilient and affordable. We will dedicate effort to communicating the benefits of engineering systems research, so that members of the public can engage in on an informed basis in important infrastructure decisions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-08-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5374638</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institution of Civil Engineers</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Needs Assessment</gtr:description><gtr:id>F9A3EA66-A091-4C2D-B59C-D3D35726136E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multidisciplinary collaboration - engineering, finance, mathematics, social and economic sciences. 



The National Needs Assessment (NNA) was an Institution of Civil Engineers initiative to examine the UK's likely infrastructure needs in the coming decades - set against uncertainties such as climate change, population growth, global energy prices and economic change. It also looked at the way infrastructure networks relate to, and depend on, one another and how this will impact on the performance of networks in the future.

We provided the primary evidence for the NNA through our modelling framework for analysing the relationships between and among infrastructure networks. Our scenarios set out the main demand drivers on infrastructure - population growth, climate change, technology, economic trends.

 The National Needs Assessment sets out a vision for how infrastructure delivers economic growth, thriving communities and embraces technology to deliver a low carbon future. It is a blueprint for the National Infrastructure Commission's (NIC) long term infrastructure assessment. The MISTRAL programme is now providing the analytical framework for the National Infrastructure Commission's (NIC) National Infrastructure Assessment.

The ITRC collaborated with Infrastructure UK (IUK), HM Treasury, to inform the work of the Major Infrastructure Tracking (MIT) team and the national infrastructure pipeline. The IUK infrastructure pipeline consists of circa 497 infrastructure projects with a budget of approximately &amp;pound;450 billion for the next decade for investment in energy, transport, water, waste water, and solid waste. This successful collaboration led to the ITRC being invited to provide analytics for the National Needs Assessment exercise. The NNA is a first step in the creation of the National Infrastructure Commission recently announced by the Chancellor of the Exchecker, George Osbourne, to be led by Lord Adonis. 

The coalition undertaking the 'National Needs Assessment' is being chaired by ICE President and National Infrastructure Commissioner Sir John Armitt, who announced its launch at his ICE presidential address in November. It includes ICE, CBI, KPMG, Pinsent Masons, University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, Graham Dalton (former Highways Agency CEO), National Grid, London First, Green Alliance, Transport for Greater Manchester, Thames Water and the Scottish Council for Development and Industry.

The needs assessment will be based on evidence gathered during the nationwide consultation launched today, evidence hearings, research being undertaken by the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium, and a vast pool of data and analysis. It will take into account factors such as climate change, population growth and technological 'game changers'. It will also review different options for meeting the UK's needs, considering affordability, public acceptability and environmental obligations. A report will be published in October 2016 setting out a vision for UK infrastructure up to 2050 and a series of interventions Government and industry will need to make to realise the vision.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ordnance Survey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Consultation for a national infrastructure database, modelling, simulation and vizualisation facility ( MISTRAL/UKCRIC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>338D2F54-5D15-464F-B9C8-C470D97B4D79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The process is being developed with a major consultation event to be hels in June/July in London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>There has been several meetings, Innovate UK is fully commited in supporting the consulation process.

Spatial scales that we consider are: 
? Global: including issues of climate change mitigation, resource exploitation, finance, security etc. 
? National: including macro-economics, infrastructure investment, innovation, social policy, civil protection etc. 
? Regional and catchment scale: including water resources management, regional economic development etc. 
? City-scale: including adaptation to climate change, local energy systems, transportation and mobility, etc.
We focus upon the most challenging decision making problems, which are characterised by deep uncertainty, and multiple actors with multiple and conflicting values. 
We aim to develop a programme for DMDU 2017 that combines: 
? Insights from the cutting edge of DMDU methodology and tools
? Applications that illustrate the practice of DMDU
? Theoretical reflections on the nature of DMDU
? Practitioner challenges for new applications of DMDU

Middle East infratructure
NISMOD-International

The current ITRC-MISTRAL research program encompasses the analysis of infrastructure systems at multiple-scales including &amp;quot;across scales&amp;quot;, that is, to assess and compare infrastructure systems at a national scale in other countries around the world. Our intention therefore is to adapt and apply our ground breaking systems-of-systems infrastructure assessment capabilities to other countries and contexts including developing countries, rapidly developing city-states, and post-conflict, post-disasters contexts.

Most of the world's infrastructure development is occurring outside the UK in rapidly emerging economies with the greatest infrastructure gap present in the poorest countries of the world. Infrastructure decisions being made now will lock in development pathways.

In the international cases we have examined so far we have seen a wide range of planning and decision methodologies, but no long-term cross-sectoral strategic systems analysis. Given the scale of infrastructure investment required around the world, from post-disaster situations to rapidly industrialising economies, it is not surprising that ITRC has been invited to apply its approach in situations outside the UK, from Palestine to China.

As a key component of this research we are developing, in collaboration with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), a series of open-source analysis tools known as NISMOD-Int for the application of evidence-based decision making to developing countries. These tools will allow recipient countries to develop and assess alternative infrastructure transition strategies for meeting their future sustainable development goals. This work is currently being piloted in the occupied Palestinian territories with plans underway to extend our coverage to Africa, Asia and the Island States.

A central module within the open-source analysis tools we are applying is a generic infrastructure systems assessment framework that can be applied to any of the diverse range of possible international settings. Integral to this framework will be the ability to combine the surplus of rapidly emerging global datasets, including big data from remote sensing satellites and mobile devices, with country-specific engineering insights and on-the-ground assessments gained from our UNOPS partners. By applying our methodology at a variety of scales we will enable an exploration of the many different infrastructure network configurations that might be achievable given the lock-in to infrastructure systems that have been built in recent decades and the current patterns of investment. And in post-disaster, post-conflict contexts provide the capacity for evidence-based strategies to enable affected countries to 'build back better'.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (DSTL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conference DMDU2017: Decision making across multiple scales</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2F06229-C224-412D-87FB-06554D4C81DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There will a high profile international conference delivered on 13-15 November 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>DMDU2017: Decision making across multiple scales

The ITRC has been awarded &amp;pound;5.3 million of funding from the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council for another five years of research. The aim of the MISTRAL (Multi-scale InfraSTRucture systems AnaLytics) programme is to develop and demonstrate a highly integrated analytics capability to inform strategic infrastructure decision making across scales, from local to global. MISTRAL will thereby radically extend the ITRC's pioneering infrastructure systems analysis capability.

At the launch, Professor Jim Hall reported on the ITRC's interim results in providing the analytical framework to the National Needs Assessment (NNA) led by Sir John Armitt. The NNA aims to inform the decisions of the National Infrastructure Commission which the media has been covering closely. The ITRC was delighted to welcome keynote speaker Lord Adonis, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, and Keith Clarke, ICE Vice president, who also spoke.

 &amp;quot;Five years ago, when we started on the ITRC journey, proposing theory, methodology and network models that stretched from the household to the globe, and from the UK to different national contexts would not have been credible. Now, thanks to what we have achieved in ITRC, the opportunity for multi-scale modelling is coming into sight.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eci.ox.ac.uk/news/2016/0524-ITRCLaunch.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future research meetings to discuss NIC engagement elements: transport model (21/03/2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E49C7AD1-083F-42A8-B82D-7A8FA9F139C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Future research meetings to discuss NIC engagement elements: transport model (21/03/2017)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with external stakeholders: Presentation of the National Infrastructure Systems MODel International (NISMOD-Int) concept along with United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) at UN Aid and Development Funding Conference in Bangkok</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEB824B3-72CA-4A98-8834-A342F39DDDA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>22/06/2016: Matt Ives (ITRC Mistral) presented the National Infrastructure Systems MODel International (NISMOD-Int) concept along with United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) at UN Aid and Development Funding Conference in Bangkok, Thailand.

Apologies: 

1. Introductions and purpose of the ITRC-MISTRAL Client Group
GD welcomed participants
JH introduced the purpose of the Client Group, to provide high level guidance and advocacy to ensure that the MISTRAL programme is directed at the most important strategic questions for national infrastructure in the UK, and the outputs of the MISTRAL programme are taken up as widely as possible. JH emphasised the importance of a focussed approach to connecting the research to infrastructure owner and end-user needs. He also emphasised the importance of legacy for the MISTRAL programme. Advice is sought from the Client Group on both of these matters. 
2. Briefing on the background to the ITRC research and analytical capability. Future plans for the MISTRAL programme
JH provided an overview of the achievements of the ITRC programme and 
JS challenged the suggestion that the priorities for MISTRAL challenge 3 should be emerging markets and least developed countries. No developed economy has this level of capability, so there is much potential for MISTRAL in these countries. 
JS questioned where affordability comes into our thinking. JH emphasised that ITRC is providing the evidence to inform trade-offs about affordability. He also noted that ITRC is analysing capital and operation costs of infrastructure but acknowledged that there are many factors that mediate between costs and user bills. JS and JR emphasised the complexity of the relationship between costs and bills. 
RP asked for more specific indications of impact. He emphasised the benefits in terms of cross-cutting impacts and targeting investment. Possibilities are: reduced cost, better targeting of investment; better timing of investment; better discussion of investment. This will inform research design and help advocacy by the Client Group. JS emphasised the importance of understanding interdependencies. JH explained that modern decision analysis methodologies provide new capabilities for uncertainty and decision analysis. JD suggested that ITRC has also contributed by developing shared understanding and a common vocabulary. JS challenged what the improvements could be made to decision making around major projects like HS2 or airport capacity or Hinkley. 
3. Discussion of industry needs for infrastructure systems analysis on the timescale of 2-10 years in the future
JR: There is a gap in understanding of where people live and work and how they behave. ABM is an interesting way of addressing this. 
NW: The energy landscape has changed. How do you keep up with that rapidly changing landscape. JH indicated that the MISTRAL research will be dealing with more of this complexity in its new modelling. JW explained that MISTRAL will be able to look at energy interactions and interdependencies in a way that has not been achieved previously, for example in terms of interactions between electricity and gas. 
GD: There is a genuine need for better planning across sectors. 
JP explained that the ITRC transport modelling had gone beyond corridor modelling to look at the national system from a multi-modal perspective. 
JD noted the links with the Environment Agency's Long Term Investment Scenarios, which has not yet paid much attention to interdependencies. There is potential for better treatment of cascading failure and indirect damage. There is potential also to look in a more nuanced way at demographic change. 
JS: Mapping infrastructure and interdependencies is useful for resilience planning e.g. energy for water. What are the competing needs for water e.g. agriculture. Links to housing and where water demand will be - benefits of planning on a consistent basis. How to keep analysis up to date? 
JK: Potential to do a better job on interdependencies. Impacts of a digital railway. Affordability plays a much greater part in decision making. Network Rail does not have control over all instruments for managing demand: JK would welcome better approaches to forecasting demand. 
JR: Benefits of consistent assumptions in GDP, population etc. The analysis of resilience is useful and unique. Triangulation against other models is worthwhile. There is benefit to be had in making evidence more open and transparent. Interactions with the planning system are very important, whilst difficult to model. Intra-urban transport is very important - where does the transition lie between car-based and mass transit cities if we continue to see transport growth. Feedbacks between infrastructure investment and growth - probably not best dealt with by integrating everything into the model. 
JH: Household location has come up in a number of different comments. MISTRAL will adopt a household allocation disaggregator to develop higher resolution models of where houses be located. JD: the location of the floodplain could also be a constraint. JR: actually insufficient amounts of housing are built, so household sizes may increase - may be best to exogenise the planning decision and then explore the consequences. 
RP: Analysis of interdependencies is useful. How can we add richer information into interactions with customers and stakeholders? Lead-times for policy and behavioural changes and how this relates to questions about, for example, investment in advance of need: how can regulators be better informed: interdependencies across sectors and with the economy. Could really help regulators improve their game. 
NW: Energy sector doesn't need another model. All models have proved to be wrong regarding the current situation in the energy sector. What's needed is the over-arching umbrella to deal with interactions and common assumptions e.g. electric cars without low carbon electricity. Need to be realistic about lead-times.
EO: Significance of interdependencies between telecoms development e.g. in relation to transport corridors. 
JS: Most decision is retrospective post-justification - ITRC should aim to improve decision making at an early point. Cities are very important - need ability to model cities. This will be the best database and repository of information - need to think through what ability will be given to others to leverage off the model. 
NW: interface into corporate investment decision making
4. Operation of the ITRC-MISTRAL Client Group
JH: from this discussion we will prioritise and sequence the research and development work. At the next meeting we will present a plan. We should also discuss the business model and legacy - how can we collaborate and leverage?

What do we need to do to build the cities of the future? Join an expert panel on Thursday 24 November, 2-3.30pm GMT, to discuss.
At the end of October, after the Habitat III conference, the UN formally adopted a new plan for cities that was two years in the making. The New Urban Agenda will guide urban policy at every level for the next twenty years. So how do we start putting the vision into practice?
There are many questions around how to implement the new agenda. How do cities of the future should promote civic engagement? How can we make sure that our cities are spaces where girls and women can achieve their full potential? And as the world is rapidly ageing, how do we make sure cities are built in a way that promotes mobility and access for older people?

Agenda
1. Welcome
2. Minutes of last meeting 
3. Overview of intended outcomes of the ITRC-MISTRAL programme 
4. Business model(s) for the legacy of ITRC-MISTRAL
5. AOB and date of next meeting. 

GD welcomed the meeting participants and noted the minutes of the last meeting that were circulated with the agenda. 
JH explained that at the last meeting two questions were raised by the Client Group: (1) to summarise the main intended outcomes of the MISTRAL programme and (2) to begin to consider questions of legacy from the programme and how the research would be taken up in practice. The two notes that were circulated with the agenda address these two issues. 
Intended outputs of the ITRC-MISTRAL programme
JH presented the first paper on the intended outcomes from the MISTRAL programme, which are summarised as: 
1. A national-scale system-of-systems modelling capability for assessment of infrastructure assessment decisions
2. Models and datasets for analysis of risk, vulnerability and resilience in interdependent infrastructure networks
3. A national infrastructure database
4. A platform and process for infrastructure assessment in countries outside the UK
5. Global infrastructure network analysis 
6. Modelling of the inter-relationship between infrastructure and the economy
7. Insights into the governance of interdependent infrastructure systems 
NWil emphasises the significance of international supply chain connectivity and suggested possibilities to link up with new data on production sites, for example from the pharmaceutical industry. 
JSp noted the significance of extreme events and the need to link between risk and vulnerability issues (outcome 2) and long term infrastructure planning (outcome 1). Further work to establish the economic impacts of extreme events would be helpful. JSp sees NISMOD/ITRC as a way to help make the business case for infrastructure in an independent way. GD suggested that the ITRC should take more account of behavioural changes: tolerance of failure is decreasing and expectations for no downtime are getting higher.
PH-B explained two of RICS's initiatives that are potentially relevant: (1) relating to floor area and land value, which may be relevant to spatial modelling and (2) international work on construction data, including construction pricing. JH agreed that a follow-up meeting would be helpful. 
JR noted the importance of connectivity for a service-based economy. Work on analysis of connectivity would be helpful. The most interesting and challenging intended outcome is #6 (Modelling of the inter-relationship between infrastructure and the economy). The ABM approach is very interesting. Where people live is a function of the planning system, so we need to consider how that is going to be modelled. Locational decisions within and between urban areas and ability of people to get into the CBD of big successful cities are emerging as a challenge. The NIC's thinking on resilience is less developed, so they welcome input on that. 
GD emphasizes need to take political dimensions into account in analysis of governance. JR would like to understand more about the research on governance (output 7). It was agreed that the next meeting should involve the SPRU team working on governance within MISTRAL as well as the representatives of regulators on the client group (Ronan Palmer, Steve Unger). 
JR also noted that over next few years new big datasets are coming available (internet of things, car sensors, oyster cards, mobile phones etc.). SB recognised this but also observed that there are challenges with matching different datasets together and in coping with data of variable quality. EO noted particular challenges with telecommunications perspective. SB also pointed out difficulties with port date - JR suggested that HMRC might have useful data. 
Security issues of data and models issues of data and models were discussed. The ITRC has already put in place security arrangements for sensitive datasets. SB indicated that whilst encryption is technically straightforward, the challenge is to manage the level of accessibility for different groups to provide the right balance of security and fitness for purpose.
Business model(s) for the legacy of ITRC-MISTRAL
JH presented the paper on business models for the legacy of ITRC-MISTRAL. 
The MISTRAL programme aims: 
? to have MISTRAL's national infrastructure system analytics in use and informing decisions by governments, utilities and regulators at a range of scales in the UK;
? for MISTRAL's national infrastructure database to become a shared national resource and a focal point for research and industrial collaboration; 
? for MISTRAL's systems analytics to be used in infrastructure planning and design around the world; 
? to be engaging a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, in understanding infrastructure performance and choices.
Potential business models might include some combination of:
? University 'business as usual'
? Sustained funding for 'national capability'
? An open source software initiative
? A global platform
? Spin-out company or companies
JR recognised the importance of sustaining capability in national infrastructure assessment: 
? The intention is to grow the NIC's capability in infrastructure assessment. NIC staff are already being trained to use NISMOD. In that sense the NIC could become a 'home' for NISMOD in the future. 
? NIC could become a funder of NISMOD if the costs involved are not huge; or could buy a subscription along with other stakeholders. The NIESC economics model is an example of this type of approach. 
? A global platform in collaboration with other countries could also interesting. Maybe NIC and other small number of country/partners (Australia, OECD, DfID etc.) could fund this.
? There are trade-offs between a tightly knit group arrangement versus a broader subscription arrangement. 
? It is important to maintain transparency so that the model can be explained. The challenge is that with more subscribers a model may become more proprietary. We want to open this up and 'bust cartels': transparency is therefore very important.
WU indicated that there needed to be clarity on what was to be offered: a model (code) or a service? There needed to be mechanisms to keep the capability together and provide updates. 
NWil: There is business in being a source of information to corporations that are concerned on business continuity. Utilities and insurers are prepared to pay for information. Think of how different decision makers are looking into the problem. 
SB emphasised the importance of developing a mechanism that ensures that the university partners stayed engaged. GD also asked what the ongoing research interest would be, as this is important for keeping the university partners engaged. It is important to maintain capability and not be overly dependent on government. 
Actions: 
1. MM to collect possible business models from other fields. What are the organisational arrangements and how is capability maintained? 
2. At the next meeting we can revisit the discussion of business models and test some options. 
Next meeting
James Stewart has offered to host a dinner at KPMG, which would be an opportunity to revisit the discussion about business models. Date be confirmed: suggest in January. 
The next formal Client Group meeting will be on the first day of the ITRC-MISTRAL Assembly in Cambridge on the afternoon of 4 April 2017 followed by dinner in Churchill College.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research engagement with Challenge 1 researchers: Building characterisation, aggregation and scenarios</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E9ECE8F2-E2D5-4BE3-8447-DBAF7C4AE97C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>September 2016 Meeting with Mark Birkin and Will Usher to develop and agree population attribution of buildings and population geodemographic data structure for NISMOD-DB2.

Our event brought together leading players in the digital communications sector, including industry, policy and research. They considered some of the critical issues facing the digital communications sector and how best to create a model the UK's digital telecommunications infrastructure to help decision-makers in policy and industry.

We would like to thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, funders of the ITRC-MISTRAL programme, and Analysys Mason, who sponsored this event.

 Mobile, wireless and satellite networks
 Modelling the UK's digital communications

Professor Jim Hall (University of Oxford) described the challenge of integrating digital telecommunications within ITRC-MISTRAL. Different from other infrastructure sectors, it is marked by rapid technological innovation with the demand for services co-evolving with capacity provision. It is tough to get data on networks and systems, and analysing resilience is tricky when there is a lot of redundancy in the system.

For this workshop, ITRC-MISTRAL is seeking some advice on how we should advance our modelling capability - what outputs will be most useful?

Dr Joe Butler (National Infrastructure Commission - NIC) outlined the NIC's work so far on digital communications. This is primarily an in-depth study on 5G (Connected Future), reflecting the NIC's conviction that digital is a core part of the UK's infrastructure: the glue holding the other infrastructure sectors together.

NIC recognises that there is need to create a coherent approach to public investment in digital infrastructure, and the next National Infrastructure Assessment (NIA) will include some recommendations to government. NIC is at the evidence-gathering phase for the NIA. A workshop on 23 March will be part of this (anyone interested in attending should email enquiries@nic.gsi.gov.uk by 9 March 2017).
1. Fixed and satellite networks

Professor Polina Bayvel (University College London) introduced the session by exploring the history and potential of the UK's optical fibre communications infrastructure. It still carries 99% of all data and there are still improvements that can be made to increase capacity on this network. It is also critical to the operation of all UK infrastructure.

Professor Bayvel argued that we should not use the present to predict the future, and that a new national planning model needs to incorporate present data as well as some blue sky technological options and a range of variables, including policy (which has moved slowly so far).

Ian Hawkins (Head of networks research, BT) presented the trends and changes as seen from an industry perspective and which are driving investment.

He described the changing interactions taking place over the broadband network, such as immersive content and the Internet of Things. The UK's fixed network is performing well compared to other EU countries, but more needs to be done with the existing network to meet increasing demand. BT has an ambition to put 11m customers on ultra-fast broadband by 2020, but there is an economic judgement about where to put this investment: new build, ease of access, density of business?

For the future, there is likely to be progress with network function virtualisation, to improve network resilience and adaptability. This approach has been taken up by NTT (Japan) in response to their experience of natural disasters, which in themselves make great demands on telecommunications networks. In future there will be a more software-based network, with cloud and network infrastructure converging. While this will be more agile, it also highlights the challenge of cyber-security.
1.2 Fixed and satellite networks - panel session

Dr James Allen (Analysys Mason), Andrew Ferguson (thinkbroadband), Dr Joel Grotz (SES Satellites), Robert Kenny (Communications Chambers), chaired by Professor Jon Crowcroft (University of Cambridge).

The questions ranged widely: the regulatory framework, market mechanisms to promote investment, the role of competition, international comparators, the role of satellite and dealing with customer expectations.

Main discussion points

 Policy tends to drive development, but needs to be exercised with some caution. Being a prudent (technological) follower minimises the investment risk.
 Competition has largely worked, but it's not clear how it can address the gaps in service that still exist. Some people still have a single, poor option, so competition hasn't worked for them.
 Where there is choice for consumers, it's important that they are guided to make the right choice for their needs.
 Market interventions can work to promote social as well as economic objectives
 Integrating digital into other infrastructures is a good idea, but difficult to co-ordinate in practice and not always good value.
 UK's digital infrastructure is good and broadly does well in international comparisons, but there are problems at the bottom end of the market.

2. Mobile, wireless and satellite networks

Professor Mischa Dohler (Kings College London) opened the discussion on mobile and wireless networks. The current capacity has increased by a factor of a million, largely driven by the move to smaller cells and network densification. More investment here would be more productive, but academic and policy interest tends to focus on the smaller improvements delivered by the physical layer.

Looking ahead, there are some inevitable trends: continuing increase in data transmission speeds, an increasing number of devices, improvement in delay. To help to respond to these changes, fibre networks need to be improved and new sharing models should be developed. There should be efforts to enhance cell density - but are there sufficient skills to install the necessary base stations? Would de-regulation of planning help? Who will be the new players in the sector in the future, and will a new regulatory framework be required?

Rupert Baines (CEO of ULTRASoC and non-Executive Director of Accelleran) gave an industry view which focused on consumers as the driver of change. The services people want, and how they are regulated, will dictate how the industry grows, not new technological development.

However there are some emerging trends: tablets and 'phones are the most popular devices, drawing on large data centres, with laptops and PCs starting becoming the niche devices. Similarly for wireless, it's either a small box or a large data centre. Spectrum is a scarce resource and isn't being allocated well, with some bands full while others are under-used.

For the future, the application of small cells could help to improve coverage in rural areas with consequent social benefits. This might also be a way to address the increasing demand for mobile connectivity on transport, especially roads and railways, with innovations such as small cells located in vehicles. Globally, while Europeans are looking to 5G networks, remember that in developing countries, most people will be using 2G for the next five years.
2.1 Mobile, wireless and satellite panel session

Colin Blackman (Camford Associates), Dr Hector Fenech (Eutelsat), Dr Zoraida Frais (Technical University of Madrid), Caroline Miller (O2), chaired by Graham Louth (Aetha Consulting).

The questions focused on improving coverage, better customer experience, network densification and provision of 5G.

Main discussion points

 The business case for 5G has not yet been made. Most applications can be delivered on 3G/4G.
 Improving coverage is necessary, but there seemed to be consensus that a range of solutions would need to be considered, such as: subsidies, satellite, national roaming; and better stakeholder engagement.
 Densification of networks will be necessary to improve services - there are clearly a number of constraints, including planning rules and availability of sites. Satellite might be helpful where traffic is sparse.
 Customers mainly want a reliable service, but it's important to understand what customers need and will pay for, and to not only be led by technology.

3. Modelling the UK's digital communications

Dr Ed Oughton (University of Cambridge) introduced the digital strand of the ITRC-MISTRAL programme. It aims to understand capacity demand as well as risk, vulnerability and resilience. The model tries to answer questions such as: what is the cost of deploying digital communications; and how will this change over time? It also aims to model infrastructure viability, behavioural deployment strategies and interdependencies with other infrastructures (e.g. insights into energy demand of the network and responding to demands from the transport network).

The research team appealed for help with access to data sources, and also for information from industry and policymakers on what they would like the model to do for them.
3.1 Modelling the UK's digital communications, panel discussion

Cristina Data (OFCOM), Neil Fleming (AIG), Noelle Godfrey (Connecting Cambridgeshire), Nick Palmer (Bellever Risk Management), chaired by Philip Guildford (University of Cambridge).

The questions related to requirements from modelling of digital infrastructure, access to data sets and understanding resilience.

Main discussion points

 Useful outputs for a model would include exploring scenarios, informing future planning, how to expand connectivity, predicting future demand and growth, resilience to multiple failures and the impact of one failure on other systems. It must be applicable to a local level.
 Is the model one based around risk and resilience, or one that incorporates supply/demand and policy factors? How can a digital system be resilient under both approaches?
 Improved access to operators' data might be possible if they can see the benefits of the model outputs and are convinced that their data will remain confidential. Operators are reluctant to share data, and ITRC-MISTRAL is looking at crowsourced data as an alternative.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.itrc.org.uk/digital-communications/the-future-of-digital-communications/#.WMgld38qtdg</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>01/09/2016: Plans for the MISTRAL transport modelling; presentation at the Royal Geographical Society conference, London, Conference theme: Nexus Thinking</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2A9F228A-2549-410E-A355-60052DC5579D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the ITRC Mistral project's national framework for high resolution infrastructure simulation, Simon Blainey, Raghav Pant and Scott Thacker gave a presentation at the Royal Geographical Society conference on 1 September on plans for the MISTRAL transport modelling.

Ensuring affordable and reliable access remains a major challenge in developing countries, but one that is further complicated by both a changing climate and changing climate policies. 
 
The balancing act across the three dimensions of sustainability - social, economic, and environmental - is increasingly central to the infrastructure challenge, even as the world appears to have made little progress in solving the infrastructure finance gap. These issues can and have been addressed from different scientific perspectives, including many different disciplines and methods. However, despite a clear move of the academic community towards interdisciplinary projects, researchers working on specific aspects of the infrastructure agenda are not systematically interacting with each other. 
 
The Fifth Green Growth Knowledge Platform (GGKP) Annual Conference will be hosted by the World Bank on the topic of sustainable infrastructure, to stimulate research on these issues and foster interdisciplinary dialogue where relevant. This conference aims at taking stock of recent advances and research challenges. To do so, we plan to gather the best researchers in the field, both from the academic world and from more policy-oriented backgrounds, to exchange ideas and insights in a two-day conference organized at the World Bank.

The World Summit, organized by United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), hosted over 3,500 delegates from local, regional and national governments, the private sector, civil society, academia and the international community from over 110 countries.
The event, which included plenaries, two permanent working platforms, workshops, policy dialogues, community forums, Learning forums and other interactive sessions, was held immediately prior to the Third UN Conference an Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) taking place 17-20 October 2016 in Quito, Ecuador.
On 14 October 2016 the Global Task force of Local and Regional Governments (GTF), facilitated by UCLG, convened the second session of the Second World Assembly of Local and Regional Governments. The Second World Assembly adapted a statement containing key recommendations from local and regional governments far Habitat III's main outcome, the New Urban Agenda, which is intended to guide urban development policy across the world during the next two decades.
In addition, UCLG bunched the 4th Global Report an local Democracy and Decentralization (GOLD IV), providing analysis, innovative examples and case studies from around the globe to support the recommendations of the Global Agenda of Local and Regional Governments for the 21st Century.
Throughout the World Summit, the 5th UCLG World Congress convened and, an 15 October, the UCLG World Council elected the new UCLG President far 2016-2019, Mpho Parks Tau, Councilor of Johannesburg, South Africa, and President, South African Local Government Association.

We are very keen to speak with you to get your thoughts on this high profile project that will bring together the latest academic research to impact on future policy in government. 

The latest academic research is vital to help shape future policy making in the cross-cutting area of Mobility. Foresight projects last about 12 months and previous futures projects have included Population Ageing, Cities and Manufacturing (for more information please follow https://www.foresight.gov.uk). A key element of this work on transport will
be to analyse the existing scientific landscape, using the best available data, to build a robust evidence base on how transport demands and provision could look in 2040. In particular, a detailed investigation into the status quo, current trends and identification of drivers of change will be conducted. Social, demographic, economic and technological trends will be considered to develop a set of transport futures, projecting 25/30 years into the future. The project will also work with policymakers to consider what this evidence base means for policy development in their area. 

Infrastructure systems is an area that we are very keen to explore and having identified yourself as an expert in this field, I would be very interested to see if this is an area where you can help. We are especially keen to find out more about the work of the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium.
