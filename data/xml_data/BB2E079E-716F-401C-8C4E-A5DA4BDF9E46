The research vision builds on the project partners' complementary skills and strengths in the area of 'towards zero -power ICT' with the potential to lead to multiple scientific and technical breakthroughs. The first breakthrough is to make use of the SHM sensing device itself to implement a single multifunctional device providing both structural health data and electrical energy harvested from mechanical vibrations. Another breakthrough will be to store the harvested energy in a fully integrated smart storage device, which adapts its storage capacity, according to the available energy in the environment and to the power consumption of the load. This adaptability will provide a constantly optimized matching between storage device and energy harvester to foster energy transfer. The energy storage itself will be a micro-ultracapacitor, so will have the desirable features of high specific energy, short time response, long lifetime and safe operation. This micro -ultracapacitor will be implemented in a silicon compatible technology so as to facilitate co-integration with other functions. Moreover, to drastically reduce the power consumption of the communication module, the proposed strategy is based on using impulse radio UWB (ultra-wideband) and dark silicon design approaches. A final innovation will be the co-location of the different devices (harvesting, sensing, storage, processing, data transmission) on the same flexible substrate, in order to enable conformal attachment of the device, a characteristic highly desirable in a SHM context wher e the surfaces to be monitored are seldom planar. Additionally, by this means the issue of the anisotropy of vibration harvesters is settled, the harvester being, by nature, properly oriented. More globally, the project aims at producing a device in which co-integration, co-location of functions, versatility of applications and energy autonomy are pushed to a maximum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will make breakthroughs in the fields of power harvesting and power storage and will lead to a decrease in power consumption so ena bling battery-free wireless sensing nodes for a range of applications. There are no other research projects within the EU academic community which have the scope of this multi-breakthrough multidisciplinary research which encompasses multifunctional sensing and energy harvesting, energy storage, power management wireless communication technologies, computing with flexible and intelligent energy flow control for minimization of energy consumption and multiphysical modelling and an optimisation framework to support vertical system integration.

It is expected that the scientific research will significantly lead to a comprehensive understanding and developments-ranging from
- macro and nano-scaled component and sub-system to system architecture design and integration,
- hardware and software to integrated software approaches,
- and system demonstration for future transfer of the technologies to industry.

These developments will ultimately increase the harvested and stored energy and reduce the power consumption of ICT and enable the emergence of innovative, scalable and reliable energy technology and progression towards zero power ICT.

The developed enabling technology will provide self -sufficiency in energy supply for monitoring of structural health conditions and is potentially suitable for a wide range of industrial applications in structural health monitoring, including those in the aerospace aviation &amp;amp; defence, automotive &amp;amp; transport industries and on such structures as wind turbines for renewable ener gy, water, oil and gas pipe-lines, and civil bridge and tunnel infrastructures. Potential markets include wireless sensors, process controls and consumer devices. The global market for energy harvesting could grow to $4.4 billion by 2020 and the EU has the capability in sensors and instrumentation, electronics, and design to exploit these technologies.

The potential benefits of the technology for stakeholders are:
1 No need for batteries and so no need to replace batteries
2 No need for cabling to mains
3Truly &amp;quot;Fit-and-Forget&amp;quot;
4 Reduce costs and time in installation, replacement and maintenance</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>410459</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Barcelona (UB)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Psychiatry Barcelona</gtr:department><gtr:description>SMARTER</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCD9E8C8-10DB-40E8-8AC8-E5A9ED29ED64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multi-disciplinary research collaboration, encompassing materials, physics, mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering, and information and communication technology with an &amp;quot;integrated system approach.

The presented technique has a specifically designed high-pass filter which has a peak output voltage that corresponds to the VOC/2 of the PEH, which is also the voltage when maximum power transfer occurs in that circuit configuration. The control circuit filters and differentiates the voltage across the smoothing capacitor to directly determine the timing of reaching the VOC/2 of the PEH without having to find the VOC first, and is fully implemented using discrete analog components without the need of a programmable controller, leading to low power consumption of the method. The control circuit is used in conjunction with a full wave diode bridge rectifier and a DC-DC converter to harvest energy from a macro-fiber composite (MFC) PEH. The MFC was subjected to various strain levels at low frequencies from 2 to 10 Hz.

In the work presented here, a knee-joint energy harvester (KEH) was introduced to power a customer-built wireless communication sensing node (WCSN). The KEH used a mechanical plucking technique to provide sufficient frequency up-conversion - from a few Hz to the resonant frequency of the KEH - so as to generate the high power required. It was actuated by a knee-joint simulator, which reproduced the knee-joint motion of human gaits at a walking frequency of 0.9 Hz. The energy generated was first stored in a reservoir capacitor and then released to the WCSN in a burst mode with the help of an energy aware interface (EAI). The WCSN was deployed with a 3-axis accelerometer, a temperature sensor, and a light detector for data sensing. A Jennic microcontroller was utilised to collect and transmit the measured data to a base station placed at a distance of 12 m. The energy generation by the KEH and the energy distribution in the system was characterised in real time by an in-house-built set-up. The results showed that the KEH generated an average power output of 1.76 mW when powering the WCSN. After charging the reservoir capacitor for 28.4 s, the KEH can power the WCSN for a 46 ms period every 1.25 s. The results also clearly illustrated how the energy generated by the KEH was distributed in the system and highlighted the importance of using a high performance power management approach to improve the performance of the whole system.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3F530D4-1318-4E07-9910-588193DF0F30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Published In Smart Materials and Structures</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Knee-joint Energy Harvester Powering a Wireless Communication Sensing Node</gtr:title><gtr:type>Systems, Materials &amp; Instrumental Engineering</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A novel implementation method of maximum power transfer for piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) connected to a rectifier with a smoothing capacitor at the rectifier output is presented based on the half open-circuit voltage (VOC/2) of a rectified PEH by exploiting the RC response of a circuit formed by the PEH, rectifier, and smoothing capacitor. The presented technique has a specifically designed high-pass filter which has a peak output voltage that corresponds to the VOC/2 of the PEH, which is also the voltage when maximum power transfer occurs in that circuit configuration. The control circuit filters and differentiates the voltage across the smoothing capacitor to directly determine the timing of reaching the VOC/2 of the PEH without having to find the VOC first, and is fully implemented using discrete analog components without the need of a programmable controller, leading to low power consumption of the method. The control circuit is used in conjunction with a full wave diode bridge rectifier and a DC-DC converter to harvest energy from a macro-fiber composite (MFC) PEH. The MFC was subjected to various strain levels at low frequencies from 2 to 10 Hz. Experimental results show that the implemented circuit is adaptive to various vibration amplitudes and frequencies and has a maximum power transfer efficiency of up to 98.28% with power consumption as low as 5.16 &amp;micro;W.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E67D03FA-3BE1-4AEE-9DAC-DA4CF59D3C69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It will be published in IEEE Transaction of Industrial Circuits in 2017 ( High impact Journal)</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Micropower Circuit for Maximum Power Transfer Using Direct VOC/2 Finding Method in Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</gtr:title><gtr:type>Systems, Materials &amp; Instrumental Engineering</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This paper presents a single piece of macro-fiber composite (MFC) piezoelectric transducer as a multifunctional device of both strain sensor and energy harvester for the first time in the context of an energy harvesting powered wireless sensing system. The multifunction device is implemented via time-multiplexing operation for alternating strain sensing and energy harvesting functions at different time slots associated with different energy levels, that is, when there is insufficient energy harvested in the energy storage for powering the system, the MFC is used as an energy harvester for charging up the storage capacitor; otherwise, the harvested energy is used for powering the system and the MFC is used as a strain sensor for measuring structural strain. A circuit is designed and implemented to manage the single piece of MFC as the multifunctional device in a time-multiplexing manner, and the operation is validated by experimental results. The strains measured by the MFC agree well with a commercial strain sensor of extensometer and therefore, the studied method can be potentially used for autonomous structural health monitoring of strain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B5220393-C291-4454-8278-1CDFA7ADDC44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work has been disseminated to IEEE Sensors and accepted by IEEE Transaction of Industrial Circuits (high impact factor)</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Single Piezoelectric Transducer as Strain Sensor and Energy Harvester Using Time-multiplexing Operation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Systems, Materials &amp; Instrumental Engineering</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Intensive research on energy harvesting powered wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) has been driven by the needs of reducing the power consumption by the WSNs and the increasing the power generated by energy harvesters. The mismatch between the energy generated by the harvesters and the energy demanded by the WSNs is always a bottleneck as the ambient environmental energy is limited and time-varying. This paper introduces a combined energy-aware interface (EAI) with an energy-aware program to deal with the mismatch through managing the energy flow from the energy storage capacitor to the WSNs. These two energy-aware approaches were implemented in a custom developed vibration energy harvesting powered WSN. The experimental results show that, with the 3.2 mW power generated by a piezoelectric energy harvester (PEH) under an emulated aircraft wing strain loading of 600 ?e at 10 Hz, the combined energy-aware approaches enable the WSN to have a significantly reduced sleep current from 28.3 &amp;micro;A of a commercial WSN to 0.95 &amp;micro;A and enable the WSN operations for a long active time of about 1.15 s in every 7.79 s to sample and transmit a large number of data (388 bytes), rather than a few ten milliseconds and a few bytes, as demanded by vibration measurement. When the approach was not used, the same amount of energy harvested was not able to power the WSN to start, not mentioning to enabling the WSN operation, which highlighted the importance and the value of the energy-aware approaches in enabling energy harvesting powered WSN operation successfully.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C25AA91-E566-482E-AE55-EC1D56F19E95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Published in IEEE
