Work and employment remain a central concern to people's livelihoods, wellbeing and identities. But how are the terms, nature and quality of work and employment determined? In other words, what is the system of regulation that shapes and reproduces these terms?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The regulation of work and employment has always generated debate about the competing demands between economic concerns (eg, competitiveness and productivity), and social concerns (eg, worker rights, equality and social justice). However, the global financial crisis has created a high degree of tension as businesses struggle to reconcile the need to survive intensified competition whilst dealing with the fragmentation of work and employment relations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminar series takes an important step in looking at regulation of work and employment from multidisciplinary, multilevelperspectives, framing the discussion within the context of an international dialogue as the most appropriate way to have concrete impact on different stakeholders. The series will contribute to developing understanding of these issues and in doing so; it will inform policies, strategies and practices of government, businesses and unions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The series brings multidisciplinary, multilevel, international approaches to discuss the challenges associated with the regulation of work and employment. It is therefore of interest and practical significance to a range of stakeholders: academics, policy makers, public and private organisations, non-governmental organizations, consultants and professional societies, employer associations, inter-governmental agencies and trade unions. Given its focus on work and employment, the seminar series speaks directly to these range of stakeholders as they are all involved in different aspects of the regulation of work and employment; either at individual, organizational, national, supranational or international levels.

The main impact of the seminar series will be on the policy-making community (e.g., governments, inter-governmental agencies). Given that policy-makers have the difficult task of reconciling diverse interests; their work can antagonise some stakeholders. In this respect, facilitating a collective dialogue about these issues is fundamental not only to identify points of contention and points of encounter, but to deal with the inevitability of competing expectations. The seminar series will have a fundamental impact on the way policy-making organizations engage in discussion with other stakeholders about the purpose and scope of regulation. As a result of this, we suggest that the series has the potential to influence policy-makers.

We also envisage an impact on practitioners. The conception stage of the series had significant input from the ideas and proposed points of professional societies and employer associations. There is clear evidence of the need to establish a dialogue that is multidisciplinary and multi-level and in this respect; many of the issues that the series will address are directly related to the challenges identified by these stakeholders. The series will provide them with analytical tools to participate in these discussions more effectively.

Finally, we see the series as impacting scholars in the field. Discussions about academics being 'out of touch' or disconnected from 'the real world' lead back to the limited active engagement with practitioner and policy-making communities. In that respect, the dialogue facilitated by the series is not one-sided; where academics come as knowledge experts to address a passive audience of participants. Instead, the series relies on a careful organisation of discussion that fosters knowledge sharing and collaborative knowledge building. Different stakeholders will draw on ideas from others and engage in discussion to build a common framework. Therefore, the series will have an impact on how academics approach discussions about regulation. The series' strategy for participation relies on targeting doctoral and early career researchers, so we envisage that this strategy will maximise impact in this group. 

In facilitating a multidisciplinary, multilevel discussion, the series is adopting an approach consistent with the International Labour Organization's policy recommendation of &amp;quot;social dialogue&amp;quot; between stakeholders in relation to improving the quality of jobs (Papadakis and B&amp;eacute;, 2008). The series also answers calls for discussions informed by specific employment or workplace issues and have input from different stakeholders (CIPD, 2011). This would create a strong interlocking mosaic to advance practical understanding of regulation of work and employment (Trubek et al., 2000; Stewart and Martinez Lucio, 2011). As such, we are confident that the series will have a significant impact on advancing the way these stakeholders engage with each other.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>28131</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Macquarie University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research Workshop on International Regulation</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F0B51FD-4C33-4FF1-B5CA-D7E037E02DAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>????????????</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Supported the participation of three colleagues who attended the workshop to present their work, facilitate discussions as panel conveners and participated as discussants in panels.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Organization of a research workshop on International Regulation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar Series website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3408B054-4281-4A1B-8E07-D373775F22E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A website for the seminar series was created to hold information on the events and to serve as a repository for information that was discussed during the series and keep people informed (both who attended the events and those who were unable to attend).

In particular, the series raised awareness of the multidimensionality of these issues and how they play out for and intersect between a diverse range of stakeholders (e.g. workers, unions, statutory bodies, academics, non-governmental organisations, governments and firms). A key aim of the seminar series was to facilitate and promote an international dialogue that was broad in scope and disciplinary orientation. This was accomplished through the engagement and participation of leading scholars from different academic traditions and locations (e.g. Kochan (MIT, USA), Cooke (Monash, Australia), Regalia and Pedersini (Milan, Italy), Burroni (Florence, Italy); Haworth (Auckland, New Zealand), Bellace (Pennsylvania, USA), Lillie (Jyv&amp;auml;skyl&amp;auml;, Finland)) as well as representatives from non-governmental agencies, statutory bodies, trade unions, professional associations, employer groups and migrant groups (e.g. UNITE, the EHRC, the Marie Curie Migrant Network Association, Eurofound, ACAS, TUC, CBI, among others). Debates about regulation remain at the centre of discussions about work and employment and through a number of ongoing outputs aimed at different audiences, we continue to disseminate the findings of the series through two journal special issues in the Employee Relations (Regulation of work and employment and the State, edited by Rodriguez &amp;amp; Stewart, 2017), and the International Journal of Human Resource Management (Regulation of work and employment: Advancing theory and research in international and comparative human resource management, edited by Rodriguez, Johnstone &amp;amp; Procter, 2017). Members of two non-academic organizations (Unite, and Eurofound) reported discussions that took place during the seminars to others in their organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E48A7A39-3432-4FCC-886A-5583B043E26B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) There is lack of agreement between stakeholder groups (e.g. unions, academics, policy-makers, NGOs) about the scope and purpose of regulation and what it should be done to tackle how it impacts work and employment. This is partially the result of limited dialogue between these groups given that in many cases, they deal with different parts of processes linked to regulation of work and employment. For instance, while academics mainly have discussed differences in regulatory approaches through theoretical and empirical data gathering, they have not necessarily engaged with policy-makers to the extent that their insights have shaped public policy. Similarly, unions deal with the end result of regulation (or lack of) but have limited insight into both policy-making. Practitioners, for example, rely primarily on legal knowledge of regulation and have limited familiarity of regulation as discussed in labour/employment relations. 
2) Within the academic community, there are significant disciplinary differences in the way regulation is understood, theorised and used. As a result, disciplinary assessment about what matters in the regulation of work and employment is fragmented and miniaturises the bigger picture of the implications of the regulation of work and employment for workers and society at large.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1) Findings provide useful points of departure for scholarly work that traverses disciplines (e.g. economics, labour relations, law, etc)
2) Findings provide a starting point for further dialogue between different stakeholder groups as the series identified the main points of contention in relation to the meaning and purpose of regulation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9E138316-87B4-43E5-AFE1-285B98B440A5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.regulationseminars.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L000660/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>231B8162-9E4D-46FB-BB69-0A4B66598C2B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Employment Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>46FB536B-9B51-49F1-B2DF-5A14789705F2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Resource Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
