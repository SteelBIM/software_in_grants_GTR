Recent research suggests that the amygdala is important for processing emotional cues. Both an under and over-reactive amygdala could make an individual more likely to engage in antisocial and aggressive behaviour.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We already know that the amygdala of children with callous-unemotional traits is under-active when they view pictures of other people looking fearful. This could mean that instead of their amygdala signaling that they are causing distress to someone else, it is 'telling' them nothing at all. Alternatively, it may mean that children with callous-unemotional traits are just not paying attention to relevant information in fearful faces, such as the eye region. It has also been speculated that children who engage in 'hot-headed' antisocial behaviour, but have the capacity to empathise, could suffer from an over-active amygdala that makes them vulnerable to react aggressively to anything they see as a threat. None of these speculations had been formally evaluated previously.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project investigated these issues and provided more information about the emotion processing profiles associated with different subtypes of children with antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400793</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Callous-unemotional subtype of antisocial behaviour:  Research review and translational implications</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>2F57A71A-440A-449C-BFD4-626A4A9DE260</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More than fifteen years of research now underscores the behavioural and emotional differences between the callous-unemotional and non-callous subtypes of children with antisocial behaviour.

Our findings suggest that neural responsiveness to emotional cues varies with levels of CU traits across a range of emotional processing tasks.

Researchers are becoming increasingly aware of different pathways to similar problem behaviours. Children with callous-unemotional traits lack empathy and display low responsiveness to other people's distress. Their conduct problems are often severe, premeditated and persistent. These trait and behavioural characteristics are similar in some ways to hose seen in adult psychopaths.

We can employ different methodologies to investigate the vulnerabilities that characterize children with high levels of callous-unemotional traits. Research from our on lab and that of other researchers has, for example, examined cognitive-affective, biological and environmental vulnerabilities. Children with conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits have reduced sensitivity to visual or vocal displays of distress emotions and poor modulation of behavior in response to punishment. Recent neuroimaging work has begun to elucidate the pattern of neural vulnerabilities associated with high levels of callous-unemotional traits, including low amygdala activity to other people's distress. Genetically informative studies suggest that callous-unemotional traits (and conduct problems in the presence of these traits) are highly heritable. High heritability does not, however, denote immutability and callous-unemtotional traits can change over time. The challenge is to understand how biological and cognitive vulnerabilities to callous-unemotional traits can be moderated by environmental factors, such as parenting and structured therapeutic intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Genetics of callous-unemotional traits in children</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>63A75025-9F38-4601-B8D4-9771BCCB503A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an invited talk aimed at practitioners, in which our research into the genetic and neurobiological underpinnings of antisocial behaviour was outlined with especial emphasis on possible translational implications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conduct problems and callous-unemotional traits: Using different methodologies to find out more</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>7D94607A-92A6-40CE-92C6-129DC1B33B36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More than fifteen years of research now underscores the behavioural and emotional differences between the callous-unemotional and non-callous subtypes of children with antisocial behaviour.
