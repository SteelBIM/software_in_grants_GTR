DURESS</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/J014818/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With the UK's water valued at &amp;pound;200 billion p.a., Britain's 389,000 km of river ecosystems are arguably our most important. In addition to providing water, they supply other major ecosystem services such as the regulation of flooding and water quality; support to adjacent ecosystems by supplying energy and nutrients; and large cultural value for charismatic organisms, recreation, and education. However, the ways in which organisms and ecosystem functions maintain these services in rivers are extremely poorly understood. This is despite large ongoing effects on river organisms from changing catchment land use, and increasingly also from climate change. Cost implications are large and result, for example, from impacts on recreational fisheries, water treatment costs, and high value river biodiversity. By contrast, opportunities to use management positively to increase the ecosystem service value of rivers by enhancing beneficial in-river organisms have barely been considered. 

In this project, we will focus on four examples of river ecosystem services chosen to be explicitly biodiversity-mediated: the regulation of water quality; the regulation of decomposition; fisheries and recreational fishing; and river birds as culturally valued biodiversity. Each is at risk from climate/land use change, illustrating their sensitivity to disturbance thresholds over different time scales. These services vary in attributable market values, and all require an integrated physical, biogeochemical, ecological and socio-economic science perspective that none of the project partners could deliver alone. 

Using river microbes, invertebrates, fish and river birds at levels of organisation from genes to food webs, we will test the overarching hypothesis that: &amp;quot;Biodiversity is central to the sustainable delivery of upland river ecosystem services under changing land-use and climate&amp;quot;. Specifically, we will ask: 1. What is the range of services delivered by upland rivers, and which re biologically mediated? 2. What are the links between biodiversity (from genes to food webs) and service delivery? 3. How does river biodiversity affect the rate or resilience of ecosystem service delivery through time? 4. How do changes in catchment land use/ management and climate affect river biota? 5. How should river biodiversity be managed to sustain ecosystem services? 

At spatial scales ranging from small experimental catchments to the whole region, and at temporal scales from sub-annual to over three decades, the work will be carried out in upland Wales as a well-defined geographical area of the UK that is particularly rich in the spatially extensive and long-term data required for the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research findings of the project will have a direct impact on academic researchers, the water industry, conservationists, land managers, policy makers and regulators, and the general public. Impact will be maximised by the participation in the project of representatives of each of these beneficiaries.

Academic beneficiaries: Detailed information on novel methods and approaches to quantify the key aspects of biodiversity that underpin delivery of ecosystem services, and to identify key thresholds and/or resilience in service delivery will be important for community ecologists, system ecologists, hydrologists, and social-economic scientists. Key harmonised and updated environmental databases on rivers as well as information for climate change adaptation and land use management will bring further benefit, in particular to aid development of valuation methods for ecosystems. 

The water industry: In deepening our understanding of the relationship between landuse/management and climate changes and river ecosystem processes, this project will help the water industry implement a whole catchment approach to water quality management. In particular it will help to identify options to reduce and manage impacts on water quality, notably in areas that add large costs to water treatment such as elevated nitrate and Dissolved Organic Carbon content, color, and waterborne pathogens that are not controlled using standard water disinfection such as Cryptosporidium. 

Land managers: Management of land to minimize impacts on rivers and their ecosystems is a central aim of River Basin Management Plans to deliver compliance with the Water Framework Directive. Agri-environment schemes are a key delivery mechanism where managers need better information on the resilience of river ecosystems and the sensitivity of land use to biodiversity and ecosystem health. This is particularly in the context of meeting the challenge of climate change and the possible ways that land use changes may occur to mitigate climate change and to adapt to climate change. 

Conservation managers: The project will provide better information on how protecting and enhancing biodiversity may increase the resilience to deliver ecosystem services, notably in the face of land and climate changes. This will enable conservation efforts that currently revolve around flora and fauna to have a stronger justification in terms of delivering human benefits. The ability to use valuation methods to assess and decide on management options will add greatly to the rigour of these processes and help to justify implementation.

Policy makers and regulators: The project will help this group to develop measures which deliver on the objective of achieving good ecological status of rivers. Valuation methods will help to decide on how management schemes should be designed to optimize delivery of ecosystem services, and to design ways to achieve resilience to the challenges of environmental change. 

General public: Most people do not have a clear idea of the way that conservation measures are designed and implemented. By linking biodiversity to ecosystem services and their values, the public will have a better understanding of what conservation policies are trying to achieve. As well as being crucial to ecosystem function the project will show the considerable amenity value of river systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1245617</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Welsh language version of the decomposition experiment which took place in Winter 2012/13. produced by Jennifer Peach, commentary by Marian Pye</gtr:description><gtr:id>4FBB2BD6-6BEA-4646-AB58-CD188BA0D4C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video has been viewed over 100 times on YouTube</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Decomposition video (Welsh)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hkiKIIPWtg</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of 15 artistic photographs - large framed prints on easels - with accompanying explanation (A5) that explains what we are doing in Duress, why we are doing it and what are the main results.

Sponsored by Alun Ffred Jones, AM, Chair of the Environment and Sustainability Committee of the Welsh Assembly, the event attracted a packed audience from Welsh Government, Dwr Cymru, Wildlife Trusts, NERC, British Ecological Society, RSPB, Brecon Beacons National Park and other stakeholders. 

In his welcome, Alun Ffred Jones, AM described how he grew up in the hills featured in the film and in the DURESS project. He pressed researchers to make Assembly committees aware of their projects given the extent to which Assembly members rely on external evidence. They particularly need practical recommendations based on research evidence.

DURESS, he said, stood up to this challenge by outlining the key lessons learned. Matthew Quinn from the Welsh Government, a key stakeholder in DURESS, outlined the policy context. He commended the project, particularly its stakeholder and public engagement. Echoing Alun Ffred Jones', call for change, Matthew said DURESS is giving direction on habitat restoration, building an evidence base that moved beyond single natural resources to ecosystems, and helping to shape debate on payment for ecosystem services i.e. &amp;quot;paying for what nature does for us&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://nerc-duress.org/news</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Duress website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5780EB7F-9376-4145-8D23-448F8C88797F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Website has resulted in enquiries for information

The session lasted 20 minutes where we explained the water cycle, with cascading boxes to show how rainwater fell on the land, then seeped to the rivers then ended in the sea by gravity, then evaporated under the sun to form clouds that would bring rainwater to lands etc... One child was chosen to be the sun (we gave him sunglasses) and his job was to take water from the sea box and pour it over the land as fast as the gravity fed water system ran. We then chose a fisherman (equipped with a fishing rod), a footballer (equipped with a football scarf), a farmer (equipped with a cowboy hat), a factory worker (equipped with high viz vest), to represent water users. The last 3 were asked to abstract water from the river using a water blaster and bring it to the water treatment plant (bucket filled with some dark vinegar to represent pollution). We then poured the not so clean water in the river and noticed that the water both in the river and the sea was a bit polluted. Fisherman was asked his opinion and suggested fish decline. We then evoked climate change, namely predicted hot dry summers and asked sun to take keep the 'evaporated' water rather than rainfall it. With the other users continuing to abstract, the river went dry. We asked users and fisherman and all agreed there was a problem. We called 4 more volunteers: a chemist, a hydrologist, an ecologist and a social scientist on stage and explained what they did. We then explained how they need to work together and with the users to figure out a solution, which is what we do in Duress. 
Feedback from 4 teachers was that it was absolutely brilliant, fed in their curriculum, that children were absolutely mesmerised and attentive, and that they'd like us back for Y5 and Y6 in more detail. 
Feedback from one child who missed break to come and see us: 'was great and how do you become a scientist because that's what I want to do'.

Key highlights so far include:

? Energy transfers - Evidence for upland broadleaf tree planting to support fish and adapt rivers to climate change.
? Food webs are key components in the engine of ecosystem services.
? The power of biofilm in supporting production and regulating water quality.
? Landscape context affects community diversity in all groups of organisms from microbes to birds, and at all levels from genes to ecosystems.
? Water quality is highly dynamic during storms which is potentially critical to river biodiversity.
? The UKs river systems are highly dynamic as they recover from some stressors (eg acidification as at Llyn Brianne) but are degraded by others (e.g. sediments).
? Catchment land use is important for river resilience.
? The DURESS Scenarios are helping to envisage future land-use change and its consequences for ecosystem services (e.g. salmon density and moderating cryptosporidium infection risk).
? People place large value on water quality. We need the right tools and measures to quantify biodiversity and its role in ecosystem services.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Knowledge of Cryptosporidium transmission routes will contribute to change in Public Health Wales guidelines (PHW Cryptosporidium Unit leaflet -likely). Evidence of enhanced awareness of health risks to users of untreated drinking water abstractions and river leisure users very likely.
Scenarios may be used by the Waitrose agricultural ethics division to shape Waitrose land management and farming guidance policies. 
Policy decisions by Welsh Government regarding the implementation of the ecosystems approach are likely to be influenced by DURESS research. This is very likely due to Welsh Government being DURESS partner. In particular, policy regarding the management of Welsh uplands for clean water provision and policy regarding the planting of broadleaves across the UK uplands.
NRW may utilise Cardiff research to meet the legislative requirements of Water Framework Directive.
The charity RSPB may change its policy and the management of its reserves because of DURESS work on bird ecosystem services. The charity BTO or Bird Life international may advocate changes in land management based on Duress outputs. 
UK and/or European WFD may be influenced by DURESSresearch-monitoring measures and requirements are changed because of Duress research.
The company Welsh Water may utilise DURESS research to determine safe levels of water abstraction in reservoirs for river biodiversity and fish. Following DURESS research, the company may modify land use on their abstraction catchments to increase the natural water treatment process by biofilms thus reducing water treatment costs. 
Future Earth - the research evidence group for the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services -promotes Duress framework as a model to monitor biodiversity.
