Our impact and outreach activity was focussed on disseminating these three key sets of findings as widely as possible while also targetting specific stakeholder groups where appropriate. Throughout, we have sought to influence multiple audiences: policy makers, third and private sector, academics and the general public. Below we summarise our principal impact initiatives.

**Stakeholder events**
Reaching out via stakeholder events was at the core of our impact strategy. We were involved in 4 events, each aimed at a distinct audience.
 
The first event, in March 2013, was based around our research on young people's aspirations. It was mainly aimed at engaging with the charity sector, and their clients, as well as interested policy makers and opinion formers. The event included a panel discussion by young people from the charity Rathbone who reflected on their aspirations and ambitions growing up in Recession Britain - and we were thus able to relate our research to the real experiences of people on the ground. 

The second event was held at the Work Foundation, London, in June 2014, and focussed on the effects of recession on young people's labour market prospects and outcomes. The format was a roundtable discussion of invited specialists and practitioners, including a large employer and provider of apprenticeships (BT), social enterprises and charities involved in Work Programme, and local government representatives. Our findings formed the basis for a wide-ranging discussion on the steps needed to ensure that this generation does not suffer the long-term consequences that young people have faced following previous recessions. The interaction was two-way, and new avenues for policy-relevant research also emerged, for instance the potential role of vocational skills and apprenticeships (as opposed to an exclusive focus on university education).

In October 2014, we gave an invited presentation to the HM Treasury Labour Market Conference 2014 as part of a panel discussion on Young people in the Labour Market. The conference is a key event in the HMT calendar that allows interaction between academics and policy makers. As such it allowed a very focussed discussion the implication of our research in terms of education and training policy, and how it relates to international and charity initiatives (other panel participants were from the OECD and Prince's Trust).

Finally, in November 2015, we gave an invited presentation at a one-day event on The State of Social Capital in Britain, organised by Understanding Society (with the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and Cooperative Councils Innovation Network). The event was part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science and was aimed at groups including social action pioneers, public service reformers, policy advisors and social enterprises. Over 50 people attended and were able to link our qualitative research on the importance of social connections in job seeking with wider debates about social capital among practitioners.

**Closed discussions with policy makers**
As well as broad dissemination events, we had a number of closed discussions with with HMT advisers. These allowed us to go into much more detail about our research and engage two-way exchanges about its relevance to current policy challenges as well as avenues for future policy-relevant research. In one meeting we also commented on related research that HMT is conducting (on households in recession), so there was fruitful interaction between researchers across the academia-policy divide. After all of these meetings, HMT noted how valuable they had found them in terms of informing their work on labour markets.

**Dissemination to the wider public**
As well as targeted stakeholder events, we showcased our results via the project webpage. In addition to full versions of all working papers, the page includes accessible non-technical summaries of all outputs, podcast interviews, and a link to our event at the Work Foundation, which also hosted a blog about the research. We have also recently been invited to appear on Radio 4's long-running &amp;quot;Thinking Allowed&amp;quot; programme (due to air in early March 2016), to talk about our qualitative research on households in recession. A related article has just appeared in the Conversation online news magazine.

**Impact among the wider academic community**
As well as interactions with academics at our stakeholder events, we have presented our findings at many scientific conferences in the UK and internationally, thus contributing to the progress of our understanding of the consequences of recession. In addition, based on the data collection for our research on households in recession, we have produced a qualitative dataset of interviews with households who experienced job loss. This dataset has been deposited with the UK Data Service for download by other researchers (under Special Licence). Hence we have laid the foundations for further work to extend our understanding of how households coped with the recession by providing resource for others to exploit.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4C9C59CD-C183-4819-8897-0F4DDF1EEAAA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overarching aim of the research programme was to &amp;quot;comprehensively explore the immediate and longer-term impacts of economic recession on the labour market behaviour of individuals and households in Britain.&amp;quot; We highlight three main findings. 

1. The scarring effect of job loss and recession on future labour market prospects:
We have made both theoretical and empirical advances in our understanding of the long-term effects of job loss and recession on workers' wages and employment experiences (grant objective 2). This proceeded by the development of a theoretical framework to analyse the effects of human capital accumulation, job mobility and their interactions on labour market outcomes. Burdett et al. (2015) use this framework to study the long-term cost of job loss for young workers in the UK, allowing for the impact of within-firm careers. We find that low skilled workers suffer higher overall wage losses relative to high skilled workers. For both skill groups, the effects of human capital are large and generate a permanent scarring in wages. Wage losses associated with job mobility and within firm careers eventually disappear but it takes around 10 years for both skill groups. Additional analysis by Taylor (2013) focuses on young people and the effects of leaving education in a recession. He also finds that young men experience scarring effects of up to ten years in terms of lower employment, poorer quality jobs, and reduced wages. Taking a long-term view, Tumino (2015) shows that the scarring impact of unemployment on future employability was as bad in 2010 as in the early 90s recession.

2. The impact of recession on children's aspirations:
Our research on young people (grant objective 3) extended beyond objective outcomes to consider the impact of recession on school students' aspirations and attitudes towards continuing in education. Taylor and Rampino (2014) find that higher unemployment leads to lower aspirations and attitudes among children whose parents themselves are less positive about education, but there is no effect on children with parents who view education positively. The results highlight the danger that recessions may set off an intergenerational downward spiral of low aspirations.

3. How households cope with job loss and recession:
We have advanced our understanding of the strategies households use to cope with the shocks associated with recession (grant objective 5). A novel multiple-methods approach that combines quantitative analysis of large-scale survey data with a qualitative analysis of 30 couple members gives us both a representative overview of households' reactions to recession and a deeper understanding of the processes and meaning behind household behaviour (Laurie et al 2015). Contrary to models predicting that when a partner loses their job their spouse takes on more work to compensate, we find that couples are reluctant to depart from their established gender roles and norms (Gush et al 2015a, Bryan and Longhi 2013). Rather, couples resort to a complex mix of cutting selected expenditure, running down savings and relying on other family members. Having a partner already in employment greatly speeds the return to (high quality) work by the original earner (Bryan and Longhi 2015), and family financial support, advice and contacts help the job seeker secure a job that is right for them (Gush et al 2015b).

For instance, our research on the adverse consequences of recession on young people has implications for policies, such as work skills and training, to ensure that this generation does not suffer the long-term consequences that young people have faced following previous recessions. Potentially interested Government departments include HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department for Education, and Department for Work and Pensions. The findings are also relevant to those social enterprises and charities involved in delivering government initiatives such as the Work Programme, to private sector employers who provide apprenticeships, and to learning providers such as learndirect. Our research into couples' coping strategies following job loss is relevant to policy aimed at reducing the numbers of workless households and poverty more generally, as well as to specific initiatives to support jobseekers back into work. Interested organisations include the DWP, TUC, Jobcentre Plus and National Careers Service. Via direct contacts, workshops and policy events we have already established continuing links with many of these stakeholders, with more general dissemination via the ISER webpages, newsletters, podcasts and social media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2CACAA91-D5B7-432F-9A34-69C7E1AD15CB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.iser.essex.ac.uk/research/projects/recession</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>To understand the processes and motivations behind changes in labour market behaviour during periods of economic recession, this research project recorded the experiences and views of couple-households exposed to job loss in the Great Recession. Conducted as part of a larger ESRC-funded quantitative project, qualitative interviews were carried out with a purposive sample derived from the Understanding Society Innovation Panel. (The Understanding Society Innovation Panel is an annual panel survey that collects a wide range of information about the economic and social circumstances of those living in 1500 households across Britain.)Using the wealth of longitudinal information in the Understanding Society Innovation Panel, a sampling frame of approximately 150 couple households was identified where someone had either lost their job or was working reduced hours in the period 2008 to 2011. A carefully selected sample of 17 households were followed up and in-depth interviews were conducted with the couple-member who had experienced job loss and, where possible, their partner. The selection process was designed to assemble a sample reflecting a diverse range of household and family profiles; namely, couples with and without children, older and younger children; the pre-retirement phase; a range of incomes; and labour market areas across England more and less affected by the recession. Wherever feasible, partners were interviewed separately to allow each participant the opportunity to express their personal views most freely. Overall this led to 30 interviews, each of about 45 minutes in length. Fieldwork took place between October 2012 and February 2013and consent was obtained verbally. The research design incorporates the ability to link the interview transcripts to Understanding Society Innovation Panel survey data for future combined analysis of qualitative and quantitative material, subject to Special Licence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>53169760-1A8D-4947-A801-82C9DFEDD490</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gush K, Scott J and Laurie H (2015) Households' responses to spousal job loss: 'all change' or 'carry on as usual'?
