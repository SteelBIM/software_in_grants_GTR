The common causes tend to overlap, aren't well understood and have a similar appearance on imaging. Many of the imaging features are not well-defined. We are establishing a worldwide group of experts to create a common language for describing the imaging features and conducting imaging research in order to define the role of blood vessels in dementia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Neurodegeneration during ageing is commonly associated with neuroimaging features of small vessel disease (SVD): lacunes, leukoaraiosis, enlarged perivascular spaces, microbleeds, brain atrophy. These exacerbate, and are closely interrelated with, cognitive impairment, disability and dementia arising from neurodegeneration. The terminology and definitions used to describe these common imaging features vary widely, impairing clinical characterisation and subject phenotyping. This is a major barrier to progress in determining the full pathophysiology of neurodegeneration plus the contribution that SVD makes to the clinical expression of common neurodegenerative diseases and to their cause. The COEN Initiative represents, par excellence, a timely opportunity to establish a collaborative expert network to agree standard definitions and terminologies for SVD on neuroimaging, provide easy-to-access exemplars, suggested image acquisition and analysis protocols and standards for reporting of studies to optimise future research. The investigators bring complementary multidisciplinary expertise on clinical imaging of neurodegeneration from cerebrovascular, Alzheimer's disease, and ageing perspectives. UK, German and Canadian COEN experts plus external collaborators will undertake two workshops, prepare and test agreed exemplars and advisory materials. The proposed work is not being undertaken elsewhere yet is essential for improved phenotyping to advance future epidemiology, genetic, pathology research and clinical trials in the commonest neurodegenerative disorders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Intellectual property: The project is unlikely to generate intellectual property, although the initiative could lead to intellectual property in the future. However this would require more funding and would be covered under specific agreements. In the unlikely event that any intellectual property is generated, all host institutions have technology transfer offices that are able to manage such work. In the case of Edinburgh, there is already a substantial investment from MRC in technology transfer activities and these have been highly successful.
Dissemination: Plans for dissemination include peer-review journal publications, materials downloadable from partner and key society websites, and specific symposia in which the outputs from the workshops can be fed back to the community that is most critically interested at international conference symposia that will be taking place around the end of the project. The major peer-review publication will be targeted at, for example, Lancet Neurology. Materials such as an agreed set of descriptors of neuroimaging features of SVD, qualitative and quantitative rating tools and guidance on their use, imaging examples of SVD, standards for image acquisition, standards for scientific reporting of methods, analysis and results of studies on age-related SVD and neurodegeneration, bibliographies of relevant papers, datasets, analysis software and teaching materials and advisory core standards for data collection in future studies of neurodegeneration and SVD can all be made available on websites, in addition to publication in journals where appropriate. International conferences taking place around the end of the project period include the International Society for Vascular and Cognitive Behavioural Disorders (VasCog), taking place in Toronto, June 2013. Local Organising Committee lead S Black has already suggested a symposium to describe and discuss the project outputs should take place within the VasCog 2013 programme. We will also
propose a symposium on SVD at the European Stroke Conference May 2013, likely just before the end of the project, but timely for final feedback. We will endeavour to have guidance on standards for scientific reporting of methods, analysis and results of studies on age-related SVD and neurodegeneration in a form that can easily be incorporated into relevant journal instructions for authors and on the Equator website (http://www.equator-network.org/).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical University of Graz</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Neurology</gtr:department><gtr:description>COEN</gtr:description><gtr:id>97275876-56FD-44E4-8B8C-C534958743C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2 Lancet Neurology papers in 2013 (see publications)

Methods to evaluate likely underlying mechanisms of SVD are being tested in collaboration between the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (Fazekas, COEN expert, Gratz) and Edinburgh, including a) evaluation of brain mineral deposition and b) of embolic, atheromatous and intrinsic mechanisms of lacunar stroke in a population study. One paper submitted from collaboration with Fazekas group in Graz. (see publications)

Members of the COEN Network are contributing to further secondary analysis of imaging data from the ground-breaking Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Stroke (SPS3) trial led by Oscar Benavente (Vancouver, PI, COEN expert), with exchange of fellows between Edinburgh and Vancouver.
A research fellow from Maastricht (COEN participant van Oostenbrugge) visited Edinburgh and performed further development of individual SVD features into a total sum score. One paper published (see publications) and one paper in review, publication pending.

Collaboration around post-mortem imaging methods for examination of individual vascular features is proceeding between investigators in Lille (COEN expert Cordonnier) and Edinburgh. Neuropathologist (Catherine Humphries) started as Stroke Association Princess Margaret Research Fellow on neuroimaging and neuropathology in SVD, jointly supervised with Colin Smith.

Chabriat and colleagues are planning a trial of interventions in a monogenic form of small vessel disease, CADASIL, with input from several COEN partners (Dichgans, Werring, Wardlaw, Benavente).

The International Stroke Genetics Consortium has set up an imaging standards subgroup (which includes JM Wardlaw) to improve use of imaging in phenotyping for stroke and dementia gene discovery studies. A publication is accepted in Stroke.

Methods to evaluate likely underlying mechanisms of SVD are being tested in collaboration between the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study (Fazekas, COEN expert, Gratz) and Edinburgh, including a) evaluation of brain mineral deposition and b) of embolic, atheromatous and intrinsic mechanisms of lacunar stroke in a population study. One paper submitted from collaboration with Fazekas group in Graz. (see publications)

Members of the COEN Network are contributing to further secondary analysis of imaging data from the ground-breaking Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Stroke (SPS3) trial led by Oscar Benavente (Vancouver, PI, COEN expert), with exchange of fellows between Edinburgh and Vancouver.
A research fellow from Maastricht (COEN participant van Oostenbrugge) visited Edinburgh and performed further development of individual SVD features into a total sum score. One paper published (see publications) and one paper in review, publication pending.

Collaboration around post-mortem imaging methods for examination of individual vascular features is proceeding between investigators in Lille (COEN expert Cordonnier) and Edinburgh. Neuropathologist (Catherine Humphries) started as Stroke Association Princess Margaret Research Fellow on neuroimaging and neuropathology in SVD, jointly supervised with Colin Smith.

Chabriat and colleagues are planning a trial of interventions in a monogenic form of small vessel disease, CADASIL, with input from several COEN partners (Dichgans, Werring, Wardlaw, Benavente).

The International Stroke Genetics Consortium has set up an imaging standards subgroup (which includes JM Wardlaw) to improve use of imaging in phenotyping for stroke and dementia gene discovery studies. A publication is accepted in Stroke.

Munich collaborators working on various applications. EU Horizon 2020 outline submitted (Dichgans, van Oostenbrugge, Wardlaw.

Three groups are working on improved methods for patient stratification and outcome assessment in randomised controlled trials of interventions to prevent progression of small vessel disease and vascular and non-vascular neurodegeneration (Benavente, Chabriat, Wardlaw).

Further validation of the derived standard is currently being undertaken by Smith, Wardlaw and Dichgans with Smith leading, including testing the reporting checklist on randomly chosen relevant publications and refining the checklist, expected to report in early 2014. Abstract (E Smith) accepted for International Stoke Conference in February 2015.

A multi-centre trial of interventions to prevent small vessel disease progression is being planned in the UK with advice from Benavente and Chabriat. Outline approved by BHF, full submission pending.
