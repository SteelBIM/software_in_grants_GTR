Change</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K002589/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will investigate innovative ways of dividing up and representing energy use in shared buildings so as to motivate occupants to save energy. Smart meters (energy monitors that feed information back to suppliers) are currently being introduced in Britain and around the world; the government aims to have one in every home and business in Britain by 2019. One reason for this is to provide people with better information about their energy use to help them to save energy. Providing energy feedback can be problematic in shared buildings, and here we focus on workplaces, where many different people interact and share utilities and equipment within that building. It is often difficult to highlight who is responsible for energy used and difficult therefore to divide up related costs and motivate changes in energy usage. We propose to focus on these challenges and consider the opportunities that exist in engaging whole communities of people in reducing energy use.

This project is multidisciplinary, drawing primarily on computer science skills of joining up data from different sources and in examining user interactions with technology, design skills of developing innovative and fun ways of representing data, and social science skills (sociology and psychology) in ensuring that displays are engaging, can motivate particular actions, and fit appropriately within the building environment and constraints. We will use a variety of methods making use of field deployments, user studies, ethnography, and small-scale surveys so as to evaluate ideas at every step.

We have divided the project into three key work packages: 'Taking Ownership' which will focus on responsibility for energy usage, 'Putting it Together' where we will put energy usage in context, and 'People Power' where we will focus on creating collective behaviour change. In more detail, 'Taking Ownership' will explore how to identify who is using energy within a building, how best to assign responsibility and how to feed that back to the occupants. We know that simplicity of design is key here, as well as issues of fairness and ethics, and indeed privacy (might people be able to monitor your coffee drinking habits from this data?). 'Putting it Together' will consider different ways of combining energy data, e.g. joining this up across user groups or spaces, and combining energy data with other commonly available information, e.g. weather or diary data, so as to put it in context. We will also spend time considering the particular building context, the routines that currently exist for occupants, and the motivations that people have for using and saving energy within the building, in understanding how best to present energy information to the occupants. 

Our third theme, 'People Power' will focus on changing building user's behaviour collectively. We will examine how people interact around different energy goals, considering in particular cooperation and regulation, in finding out what works best in different contexts. The project then brings all aspects of research together in the use of themed challenge days where we promote specific energy actions for everyone in a building (e.g. switching off equipment after use) and demonstrate the impact that collective behaviour change can have. Beyond simply observing what works in this context through objective measures of energy usage, we will analyse when and where behaviour changes occurred and speak to the users themselves to find out what was engaging. 

These activities will combine to inform technical, design and policy recommendations for energy monitoring in workplaces as well as conclusions for other multi-occupancy buildings. Moreover, we will develop a tool kit to pass on to other companies and buildings so that others can use the findings and experience gained here. We will also explore theoretical implications of our results and communicate our academic findings to the range of disciplines involved</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The aim of the project is to identify means of changing behaviour so as to reduce energy use in shared spaces. Energy demand reduction is a cost effective means of achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As such, potential beneficiaries are wide-ranging. Project outcomes have direct and immediate relevance for policy makers; energy and climate related NGOs; any organisations large enough to run multiple-occupancy offices - be they public, business or third sector; organisations concerned with managing energy in buildings; and academic researchers in areas involving energy, climate change, and/or the built environment. There are also implications for the wider public. As issues addressed (energy demand and emissions reduction) are of international relevance, longer term beneficiaries are not UK-limited. There is the potential for follow-on work which utilises Horizon's international partners, such as China Mobile, to achieve wider dissemination.

Given the potential to reduce energy use, lower energy bills, and potentially impact on building regulations, government departments including DECC, Ofgem, and BIS will find value in the project's outcomes which, in the short term, will illustrate methods of achieving current relevant policy aims (potentially informing advice and information disseminated in this area) and in the longer term may contribute to evidence-based policy-making. It addresses several UK government policy priorities, including economic competitiveness, climate change, energy security, and sustainable development. As noted above, these interests are shared by all developed economies, and are increasingly influential on policy in developing nations. The Committee on Climate Change's (CCC) Fourth Carbon Budget (2010), which sets out UK objectives for GHG emission reductions, targets a reduction in buildings-related emissions of 56% by 2030. Whilst considerable research has been conducted into encouraging low-carbon behaviours in the home (for example smart meters research, little attention has been paid to the more complex, but no less important, challenge of achieving the same in work-place settings.

For large-scale employers, whether national and local government, businesses, or third sector organisations, the project will contribute to decarbonising their operations and the lowering of their energy costs. For the commercial sector, research outputs will also contribute to the nascent energy management services market. Here, there is likely to be particular interest in design principles and prototypes developed, and engagement solutions for different contexts and building designs which may be incorporated into current projects. Longer term impacts may include the development of new service solutions, or even new start-up companies, based on project ideas and findings. 

With regards to academic impact, the project will investigate an overlooked element in a rapidly growing research area addressing low carbon transitions. As such, it will speak to a multidisciplinary field incorporating social and computational sciences, design, and the built environment, not only generating new understandings but also strengthening inter-disciplinary linkages in areas which have so far been developed largely in isolation to one another.

For the general public, we aim to raise the visibility of energy use for employees working in shared spaces. This has the immediate aim of reducing energy use and wastage in the workplace, but may also result in further sustainable behaviour changes if those engaged transfer ideas and new energy practices to other areas of their lives. We also note the overarching value to society of achieving energy and so GHG reductions through behavioural means, both in economic and environmental terms.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1075108</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Digital Catapult Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Digital Catapult collaboration for Ctech Trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C1AE7AA-E0D9-4DB6-B879-93717981443A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary involving Sociology, Psychology, Human Computer Interaction and Computer Science.

We have undertaken small scale interventions (including workshops, and different energy visualisations) in several different types of workplace including council offices and libraries and a hospital. These have variously resulted in increased understandings of energy usage, facilitating and encouraging procedural changes to energy use, and in concrete energy savings. Our smaller scale interventions, along with empirical work and insights from each of the disciplines involved in this project was the foundation for a broader digital engagement tool for encouraging and supporting energy savings in the workplace, known as e-GENIE (Goal Setting and Energy Information Engagement) tool. 

e-Genie has now been deployed twice in early tests of the usability and utility of the tool in an industry setting and a (further different) council setting. The first deployment was only moderately successful with certain parts of the tool receiving little attention. Users particularly engaged with the tool in terms of existing space issues, in this case thermal comfort complaints whilst electricity data and tools for taking action were mostly ignored. Building users were motivated to save energy at work but felt that they didn't have much control over their use of electricity. Our data points to the need to inform and support building users in recognising where they can make a difference, e.g. in cooperative actions, such as asking managers for change, or discussing energy saving with colleagues. We conclude that energy engagement tools will be most successful in relation to existing issues in the specific building context and in order to engage building users with energy more broadly, a clear use-case must be defined or further incentives (e.g. rewards, gamification) utilised.
Our first deployment of e-Genie was particularly useful in highlighting areas for further development and were moved one part of the tool that appeared confusing, refined many usability aspects of the tool, and developed workshops in order to introduce and tailor e-Genie to the next deployment site. Our second deployment is currently underway and differs from the first in that it is an organisation with clearer energy issues to work with. It is an organisation with a larger and more stable workforce who have a greater interest in the space that they are working in and therefore we expect to see a bigger impact from the integration of e-Genie.

We are also continuing to work on a toolkit (led by CSE), which aims to translate our findings into reusable processes for further organisations. This currently consists of details of workshop protocols, procedural details for using visualisation tools such as e-Genie, a research digest of Ctech findings for a lay audience, and a practitioners summary of the existing literature on energy interventions in the workplace.

In order to further disseminate our findings and explore further potential deployment sites, we continue to have regular meetings with both existing project partners and potential future partners, and engage with industry and policy events and conferences. This also helps us to continue to transfer and reflect on our latest findings in a timely manner. Project members maintain engagement with policy events and the inclusion of a member from BEIS on our advisory panel, and the close engagement with the TEDDInet network, allows us to keep appraised of opportunities to communicate our findings in relation to the latest policy initiatives and calls for evidence.&amp;nbsp;Our findings have also been disseminated to a wider multidisciplinary academic audience and a public audience through different media including radio interviews, the project blog and occasional guest blogs.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D9CCB495-E176-4F13-8D98-2D04836A2DE5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We identify four key achievements from the continuing Ctech project: the observation of success factors in energy interventions in the workplace and identification of future research possibilities in relation to digital technologies; identification of key motivations to save energy in the workplace and how these change with social interactions; the analysis of the role of the facilities manager in achieving workplace energy reductions; and energy savings as a result of digital technology deployments. 

Our research has reviewed and integrated empirical and theoretical data from a range of academic and grey literature in identifying methods of apportioning energy data to users in the workplace, and in summarising the evidence that is known about energy interventions in the workplace. We highlight enablement (providing autonomy and support to employees), and modelling (various forms of social influence) as key features of previously successful interventions to save energy in workplace buildings. Given technical and social considerations we conclude that apportioning energy to spatially organized groups (as opposed to existing communities or individuals) is likely to be the preferable situation for most workplaces. Workplace energy policies must be coherent and integrated with wider organizational policies to be successful and we particularly recommend setting clear specific goals around energy use with accompanying feedback on those goals. 

Users must be motivated in order to change their energy use behaviour and we have undertaken a series of explorations of motivations to save energy in the workplace, quite a different context from the home where the majority of research in this field has been conducted. Our data indicates that people are mostly motivated to save energy because of environmental reasons, in order to help their company's spending and image, and in order to gain warm-glow feelings. Interestingly, self-image motivations negatively predicted energy saving behaviours indicating that people may think that energy saving does not fit with a positive work image. We also find that people's energy use intentions depend on the behaviour of others. For example, we find that cooperative behaviour is observed where people are willing to decrease their own energy use so that others can use more, where they have a legitimate need to do so.

Converging psychological data, ethnographic research, and user workshops we find that actually the potential for individual behavior change is often limited and a greater scope for achieving energy savings is likely to be achieved by looking beyond individual behavior to collaborative behaviours and organizational policy changes. The role of the Facilities Manager (FM) has a particularly pivotal role in the potential for achieving energy savings in a workplace but requires the support to do so. In particular we observe that the potential of the FM is often constrained by demands to meet workforce expectations of comfort; a lack of support from senior management; and a shortage of resources. We highlight the complexity of negotiations in energy use and management and the need to support communications between building users on this topic. 

Our interdisciplinary team of researchers has integrated expertise and insights in order to provide a multifaceted perspective on saving energy in the workplace. The original overarching aim of the project was to change behaviours in shared workplace buildings by engaging building users with interactive public energy feedback. We have met this objective through small-scale deployments in several different workplace settings. Deployments have successfully resulting in behaviour change at the building user level, organisational policy changes, and increased engagement of building users with organisational policies; importantly reductions in energy used have also been observed. We have also now conducted a larger scale deployment of our broader energy digital engagement tool (e- GENIE: Goal Setting and Energy Information Engagement tool) and are currently in the middle of a second deployment. This has highlighted many practical issues around tool design and integration of this into the workplace environment and has particularly drawn our attention to the importance of developing a clear use-case for the tool in the deployment venue so the building users are clear on the purpose of the tool.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings may be utilised by energy managers within industry, policy makers, and academics from a range of disciplines. Energy managers within industry should be able to make use of our insights in engaging staff within energy saving initiatives, and designing energy saving interventions in order to maximise savings made and likely success in terms of workforce engagement. Our insights into social interactions around energy use in energy sharing situations also provides information about the importance of context and how new technologies and systems can best be introduced in order to avoid unintended consequences (such as increases in energy use). In addition, our conclusions provide insight into organisational energy efficiencies, the utility of increasing communications about energy policy, and particularly the significance of the facilities management role and the benefits of empowering people within this position. 

There are several aspects of our findings that may be of interest to policy makers and our conclusions point to ways in which new legislations may encourage organisations to have an increased focus on energy efficiencies. In particular policies that encourage the consideration of environmental framings of energy saving (including requirements for carbon information) appear useful, those that increase the importance placed upon energy reporting, and those that increase the significance of the facilities management position would be welcomed. 

Multiple academic audiences have and continue to benefit from the work carried out as part of this project. In addition to theoretical insights contributed by the Psychological, Sociological and HCI researchers within this project to the respective disciplines, empirical work and work that integrates the different disciplinary perspectives and existing literature adds to the applied field of energy research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E531C85-BFD6-47D1-8625-118049106508</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://energyforchange.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Academic member of Customer Panel at Western Power Distribution</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21A2F3B8-F89F-47E1-B58E-7EE8A88C1674</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>International advisor to EPFL smart living lab</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F3BFADD-3029-4E70-A6BC-9A59D3CF24DA</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advisory panel member (Spence) on 'Public responses to innovative mapterials use and consumption' research grant (PI - Nick Pidgeon, Cardiff University)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A71A660C-23F5-4FCA-8FD7-146B13395514</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advisory panel member on STESS (A Socio-Technical and Multilevel Perspectives on Energy Services Security).

From the first trial the overall impact of having e-Genie in the office was minimal. The first deployment served primarily as a test of the technology and at the site, the majority of the staff had little or no control over the environment or power aspects of the building. However for those individuals that were involved in the Ctech project in some way, it was reported that it made them more conscious of energy saving and the image that is projected by a company with regards to whether they are energy conscious or not.
The organisation did report that they saw clear benefits from having e-Genie installed in our office in that it provided them with concrete energy data which they could refer to when making operational decisions. It was reported as giving credibility to points being made and allowed the illustration of, for example, exactly where the hottest bit of the building is.
The thermal imaging cameras deployed alongside e-Genie were also interesting to the building users and were taken home by building users. It was reported that people enjoyed using these and there were energy efficiency measures installed (e.g. sealing strips, draught excluders, loft insulation and caps added to chimney stacks) as a direct result of their use.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>e-Genie (Goal-setting and ENergy Information Engagement tool)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://bitbucket.org/mjewell/ctech/src/efedf3402d6fd446d0e1a7617943ae10c568762b/ctech/?at=ctech-updates</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Temperature Calendar is a web-based visualization of temperature variation within a building over the course of the past week.
