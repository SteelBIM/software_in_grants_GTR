Drawing on the census of slave-owners in the British empire created by the Slave Compensation Commission in the 1830s to manage the distribution of the then enormous sum of &amp;pound;20MM paid as compensation to slave-owners on the abolition of colonial slavery.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will comprehensively document the people in nineteenth-century Britain who either owned slaves or otherwise benefited financially from slavery, and examine the different legacies of slave-ownership.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A database Encyclopedia of British Slave-Owners will be created which will capture each of the several thousand slave-owners resident in Britain in the 1830s. It will be publicly accessible and act as a hub for the local and regional efforts to show the linkages of communities in Britain to slavery.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will examine their roles and influence within British society in their lifetimes, and trace their major legacies after their deaths, traceable through commercial and financial continuities; cultural and institutional legacies; historical lineages and memories of slavery; political affiliations and associational networks; imperial legacies in the wider circuits of Empire; and physical legacies in the built environment associated with slave-owners.&lt;/p>

&amp;quot;For Liverpool and Bristol much work has been done in tracing the role of the slave-trade and slavery in shaping the cities' histories, but the scale and complexity of London's growth in the 18th and 19th centuries has obscured the contribution of slavery to the formation of the modern capital. This lecture explores the evidence for the centrality of slavery in understanding how London became what we know it as today. This lecture marks Black History Month.&amp;quot;

Whilst the 2007 bicentenary of the end of the slave trade inaugurated an explosion of popular interest in Britain's role in the slavery business, much is still unknown about the significance of slavery to the formation of modern imperial Britain. Yet in 1833, abolition was heralded as evidence of Britain's claim to be &amp;quot;the&amp;quot; modern global power, its commitment to representative government in Britain, free labour, the rule of law, and a benevolent imperial mission all aspects of a national identity rooted in notions of freedom and liberty. This conference will bring together historians from Britain, the US and the Caribbean to discuss the legacies of slavery and slave-ownership.

We have established the life-trajectories of some 3000 absentee slave-owners in Britain, and analysis of this corpus has allowed us to trace the legacies of slave-ownership in the formation of Victorian Britain. Our drive for a comprehensive approach and our construction of a major new dataset has allowed us to move beyond the case-study approach to provide a systematic account of slave-ownership which strongly supports the view that empire was constitutive of modern Britain, a thesis which has remained highly contested. At the same time as we have been able to specify the areas in which this impact was felt, we have identified others in which it was less formative or even imperceptible. 



We have significantly modified the 'decline' thesis of the decay of the West Indian slave-economy after the abolition of the slave-trade in 1807 by identifying the rise of a new planter class in Britain connected with British Guiana (Draper, 2012). We have traced the continuing importance of slave-owners in the development of new sectors of the City of London, especially in the development of the financial structures of the settler colonies and in a commercial 'swing east' by former slave-owners. We have demonstrated the role of slave-owners and their immediate families in the rewriting of slavery after Emancipation to re-denominate the slave-owners as the victims of Emancipation (Hall, 2012) and we have shown the re-incorporation of the slave-owners into the mainstream of British politics of the 1850s and 1860s, both developments contributing to the 'racial turn' in British thinking in the third quarter of the 19th century. We have mapped the slave-owners at the time of Emancipation to identify their physical, cultural and social legacies in particular areas of concentration in cities and towns throughout Britain. We have quantified the very large extent of Scottish slave-ownership and shown that slave-ownership was comparatively marginal to Ireland and Wales. 



Our proposal for a multi-author volume by the members of the project team summarising the project findings has been accepted by Cambridge University Press for publication in 2013. We plan to deploy the dataset from the Legacies of British Slave-ownership as the foundation of a new ESRC and AHRC-funded project, The structure and significance of British slave-ownership 1763-1833, which will develop a diachronic analysis of estate ownership in the British Caribbean over the last 70 years of slavery in order to deepen the understanding of the connections of slavery and Empire to Britain's economic, commercial and cultural transformation in this period. We will therefore be able to maintain, update and extend the dataset created in the recently completed project within the research context of the new one.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The publication of the project database in February 2013 has stimulated new lines of enquiry and new work among community groups, local and regional historians, family historians and within British schools. The geographical search function provides access to information for local historians on slave-ownership in each street, city, county and region of Britain. This search function is also of use to school teachers who can show children that slave-ownership occurred among people who lived in their locality. The biographical details and relationships function are useful for family historians. Community groups have used the empirical results in discussions about the payment of reparations for slavery. The project has already had significant impact empirically and methodologically. The empirical findings are re-shaping the understanding of the 'decline' thesis of the decay of the West Indian slave-economy after 1807, the significance of slave-ownership for C19th Britain, and the wider reconfiguration of economy, society and politics in the period. These findings are evident, for example, in the papers given by external contributors to the project-organised colloquium, 'Emancipation, Slave Ownership and the Remaking of the British Imperial World' (March 2012), in Nicholas Draper, 'The rise of a new planter class? : some countercurrents from British Guiana and Trinidad, 1807-33', Atlantic studies, 9 (1) (2012), pp. 65-83, and in other outputs. The methodological impact is two-fold: first, broadening the scope of what is thought of as 'British' history by situating Britain as an imperial social and political formation; second, through integrating economic and social, cultural and political histories in to a unified framework. See, for example, Catherine Hall, 'The State of Modern British History', History Workshop Journal, 72 (1), (2011), pp. 204-10.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3D9A5CD2-1C49-4791-AABE-3ECD2C93A987</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services/ and Management Consultancy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A database of all the claims for compensation submitted following the Emancipation Act of 1834 (c. 40,000 claims) and the names of the individuals connected to these claims (c. 47,000 individuals) with more detailed biographical information on those individuals we have identified as living in Britain from the mid-1830s onwards (c. 3,000 individuals).</gtr:description><gtr:id>A365881D-7A50-4545-81A6-AC5A7E05E921</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We undertook a major publicity campaign in February 2013 to alert people to the publication of our online database.

In the past 18 months we have received over 700 emails about our database from members of the public; each email has been answered by us and has often led to a long correspondence and sharing of information. We have updated the biographies of c. 200 individuals in our database as a result of information sent to us by members of the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Legacies of British Slave-ownership database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FF8146F7-7B60-44AD-AF26-0B54F6B045D3"><gtr:id>FF8146F7-7B60-44AD-AF26-0B54F6B045D3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gendering Property, Racing Capital</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>History Workshop Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a34df89e033f66f79c3e7f0ac80ea08c"><gtr:id>a34df89e033f66f79c3e7f0ac80ea08c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hall C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EDDC1E70-FDB5-4E04-A1CF-2A77B48F1073"><gtr:id>EDDC1E70-FDB5-4E04-A1CF-2A77B48F1073</gtr:id><gtr:title>How slavery shaped modern Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BBC history magazine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3afc0becdc7b36169ba5c17003e83b19"><gtr:id>3afc0becdc7b36169ba5c17003e83b19</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nicholas Draper (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1FC872FA-63FF-4A83-BB48-484471C8EF37"><gtr:id>1FC872FA-63FF-4A83-BB48-484471C8EF37</gtr:id><gtr:title>Compensating Scottish slave-owners : 1. legacies of British slave-ownership</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scottish local history</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e6bf978c1719dad72cf69e02fe985ef6"><gtr:id>e6bf978c1719dad72cf69e02fe985ef6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Keith McClelland (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7461A913-107A-42C5-8E01-350130499782"><gtr:id>7461A913-107A-42C5-8E01-350130499782</gtr:id><gtr:title>Making histories : slave owners and their legacies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b7f9345f61f53b655d8d21f5b0aac8fd"><gtr:id>b7f9345f61f53b655d8d21f5b0aac8fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Catherine Hall (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/636CB7E7-72CF-4373-8805-402BE1C273D9"><gtr:id>636CB7E7-72CF-4373-8805-402BE1C273D9</gtr:id><gtr:title>London merchants and Caribbean slavery after the abolition of the slave-trade</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3afc0becdc7b36169ba5c17003e83b19"><gtr:id>3afc0becdc7b36169ba5c17003e83b19</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nicholas Draper (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>1900-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D75CFB09-B730-420D-B024-C72C5AB75E53"><gtr:id>D75CFB09-B730-420D-B024-C72C5AB75E53</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Dependent on precarious subsistences' : Ireland's slave-owners at the time of emancipation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/15ca1033e3c5163e8abcf1c474b13871"><gtr:id>15ca1033e3c5163e8abcf1c474b13871</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Nicholas Draper (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/836D7486-1D6D-4A67-94AB-CFE68FD84523"><gtr:id>836D7486-1D6D-4A67-94AB-CFE68FD84523</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Generous men! : humanity confers dignity upon authority' : constructions of benevolent masculinity in the rhetoric of proslavery (1789-1807)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a2922b4c4d70ce006e8611ea63b04b61"><gtr:id>a2922b4c4d70ce006e8611ea63b04b61</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Katie Donington (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6B67AEFF-9DC6-44D5-8FCE-8B4C62C3A1F6"><gtr:id>6B67AEFF-9DC6-44D5-8FCE-8B4C62C3A1F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>The rise of a new planter class?
