The study we report here seeks to identify empirical evidence for this assumed association between ageing and word retrieval behaviour. Using word association responses from two distinct age cohorts - adolescents and over-65s - we investigate age-related differences in the way that links are made between words in the mental lexicon. We measure these links in terms of how stereotypical they are (how typical their responses are of their peer group), and in terms of the kinds of association they represent (words which mean the same, sound similar, collocate (i.e. are often used together) etc.). The two groups are equally stereotypical in their responses, although there are generational differences in the most popular responses to certain words (e.g. marital and facebook as responses to status). Importantly, there are statistically significant differences in the kinds of association made, with the older cohort producing more synonyms and collocational responses, but fewer sound-based responses, than the younger group. These findings can help us to understand age-related differences in word recall, which in turn will allow us to identify deviations from healthy ageing language behaviour and word retrieval in cases of dementia and cognitive decline. This was an invited talk, delivered as part of the OPAN (Older People and Ageing Network) seminar series. OPAN aims to improve the lives of older people by integrating research with policy and practice. They invite speakers to present seminars highlighting current research, which are open to the public and typically attract social and health care practitioners, researchers from a range of disciplines, and members of the public who identify themselves with the older sector of the population.

The norms lists, used to produce stereotypy scores, were found to be sensitive to age, indicating the importance of evaluating data only against norms lists appropriate to the target population. 

Although the items on the norms lists differed between age groups, there was no difference between the two groups' propensity to produce a stereotypical response (i.e. the response most often produced by participants of the same age). However, the type of cue-response link made did differ with age: the younger group produced more responses that were erratic, involved changing or adding an affix to the cue, or were linked to the cue by sound but not by meaning. The meaning links they made tended to be less specific than the older group's. The older group produced more synonyms and more collocational responses (words commonly found together, such as bread-butter). 



Cognitive performance and lexical retrieval:

The cognitive performance comparisons for the adolescent group revealed that key cognitive measures, in particular verbal IQ and working memory, were closely associated with certain lexical retrieval patterns. Specifically, unweighted stereotypy scores were predicted by relational complexity and verbal IQ scores. 



Gender and lexical retrieval:

There is some indication that males and females performed differently on the word association task, with females producing more collocational, fewer form-based responses and fewer idiosyncratic responses than males. 



Heredity and lexical retrieval:

Initial heredity analyses, designed to tease apart the relative influences of shared environment and shared genes on word association behaviour, were inconclusive, with no solid evidence found for a genetic contribution to the variation between individuals. However, the findings indicated that a larger data set might reveal a genetic contribution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study has potential for future impact beyond academia, particularly in relation to the identification of abnormal linguistic behaviour in cognitive impairment, semantic dementia and dementia of Alzheimers type. The study found differences in the lexical retrieval behaviour of the two age groups, and this can help to identify characteristics of healthy and cognitively impaired language function. 



Future investigations using norms list protocols will be influenced by the finding that norms lists have to be matched to the target population.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8F91DBF9-59F5-4D95-9024-6AFD2D541EA9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/530DB6FD-7D46-4B9A-8EE0-8B1D4357348D"><gtr:id>530DB6FD-7D46-4B9A-8EE0-8B1D4357348D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Age, Cognition and Lexical Retrieval: Symposium Discussant Paper</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d1194ca93bd98b48526b3ea71705131f"><gtr:id>d1194ca93bd98b48526b3ea71705131f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wray A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/072E0B94-C58F-4031-A4D8-8088EF6BF35C"><gtr:id>072E0B94-C58F-4031-A4D8-8088EF6BF35C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Extracting lexical retrieval information from word association data: a users' guide (Age, Cognition and Lexical Retrieval Symposium)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d870f19c7af6d1bc61bf44b756db2478"><gtr:id>d870f19c7af6d1bc61bf44b756db2478</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fitzpatrick T.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FDC29343-C40A-43CA-A17F-41F44ED4F89A"><gtr:id>FDC29343-C40A-43CA-A17F-41F44ED4F89A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lexical retrieval in semantic dementia (Age, Cognition and Lexical Retrieval Symposium)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ec8f66c6f7fa264741eef82630bbe6e5"><gtr:id>ec8f66c6f7fa264741eef82630bbe6e5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tree, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F3F21E18-FBB0-4216-BB92-0B13F4A6CFC8"><gtr:id>F3F21E18-FBB0-4216-BB92-0B13F4A6CFC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>What's in a norm?
