&lt;p>Most recently one of these, low dose simvastatin, has become available over the counter (OTC), for people at 'moderate' risk of heart disease (10-15 per cent&amp;nbsp;over 10 years). This product, marketed as Zocor Heart Pro, is unique among drugs licensed for sale without prescription in the UK in being intended for prevention rather than treatment, as was the first product of its kind in the world. Yet little is known about the characteristics of consumers, or would-be consumers, nor about what 'use' means in this context.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This exploratory project aims to investigate these concerns through five key research questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>What factors shape the decision to purchase or try to purchase OTC statins?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do OTC statins fit in with other attempts to prevent heart troubles or preserve health?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What does 'use' mean in this context? (how often, for how long?)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How far do these accounts support 'self-care' and health consumer agendas? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the implications for policy concerning the regulation of non-prescription drugs in the future? &lt;/li>

We organised this event in collaboration with Nicola Gale in the Centre for Leadership in Applied Health Care at University of Birmingham. The event was designed to ask: What role can sociological research play in improving the quality and effectiveness of such preventative services? The first day of the event was intended to disseminate findings on both patient and professional/organisational issues around preventive health. The second day was a specialist workshop for researchers in the field to discuss methodological issues in sociological research into CVD prevention.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research has generated significant findings about people's responses to the offer of preventive medication, whether that is framed as a consumer product or a prescription drug. We have explored the limits to the salience of both risk and health for ordinary people and their everyday practices, and furthered academic understanding of 'resistance' to medicine-taking. Using our case study, and a diverse set of respondents, we have been able to question the literature on self care, health behaviours and health identities, which often assumes that people will respond as individuals and with a mixture of anxiety and calculative approaches to preventing disease. We have analysed the ways in which responsibility for heart health is distributed in health care and in everyday practices, and sought to disseminate our findings to other researchers and healthcare practitioners through the outputs listed. Furthermore we have used our growing understanding of different forms of and approaches to the 'non-use' of medication to challenge ideas about the contribution of consumer demand to the pharmaceuticalisation of contemporary life. We have drawn attention to the limited appeal of over-the-counter statins and their very particular uses, and made comparisons with other prophylactic medication such as aspirin or the polypill. Finally we have sought to engage with methodological questions about the study of health identities and practices through championing recruitment outside the clinic and experiments with online recruitment, as well as object-centred interviewing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We argued that there was a limited market for over the counter preventative drugs. People accepting statins for risk reduction put great emphasis on being told by their doctor that they need them. They do not have the same set of expectations for pharmacists. There is a large cholesterol reduction and heart health market, so people are prepared to spend money here. But the government should not expect prophylactic medication to be a successful way of reducing CVD risk in the population.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>88964BF6-8F98-4270-888D-47C2FECF567A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/79F7A90C-344C-4688-9904-2053A4CE2DB4"><gtr:id>79F7A90C-344C-4688-9904-2053A4CE2DB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Do-it-yourself heart health?
