&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>a literature review and focus groups will identify items which tap into behavioural characteristics of social worker performance&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>will validate a social work performance measure created from phase 1&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>an emotional intelligence intervention will be designed using elements from existing EI programmes which show effects on outcomes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a randomised control trial will evaluate an emotional intelligence training intervention for social workers and assess its effect on social work performance and stress.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to provide data and training material to benefit a range of public sector stakeholders from practitioners to tutors, and those working in recruitment and performance in the public sector (e.g. social work, nursing, teaching). The Children's Workforce Development Council (2010) recognises the importance of emotional competencies for social workers, and they show interest in the characteristic of resilience for initial recruitment. Data from this project will provide a psychometric instrument designed to assess social work performance. The instrument would be developed further with HR Directors within the social work departments who participated in the project, some of whom would sit on the stakeholder group. In addition HR professionals from different public service occupations would be invited to targeted seminars through the dissemination process. Another seminar would focus on the findings for social work practitioners whilst a third would gather together social work lecturers in higher education to explore the development of EI training within the social work curriculum. 

Data from this project would also provide the foundation for further commercial development of this instrument. Using data on the influence of emotional intelligence on social performance and burnout, those in higher education and firms hiring social workers would have access to new resources to select people who are psychologically suited to the demands of social work. These data could help inform practitioners and professional practice on how to better manage the issue of stress and burnout. The materials produced for delivering the emotional intelligence intervention could be adapted for use across the social work curriculum. In the long term, lessons learned from this study can be adapted and applied across all public service professions where emotional demands are high, for example: the police, nursing and teaching. This research fosters cross-disciplinary research in: Psychology, Social Work and Management. Individual differences scholars and those within emotional intelligence (EI) will benefit from new empirical evidence to establish the predictive validity of emotional intelligence, as existing evidence for EI and outcomes such as job performance shows a mixed picture (Matthews et al., 2002). The majority of emotional intelligence research into EI and performance has focused on EI effects on leadership and team performance and less so on other types of performance such as the interpersonal and intrapersonal skills required to manage a job with high emotional demands such as social work (O'Boyle et al., 2011). 

Including two EI models in this study allows for comparison of the utility of each model for real world outcomes and provides empirical data to help develop EI theory and methodology. Occupational psychologists could apply the findings to recruitment, assessment and training. The concept of EI is used in the commercial sector of psychometrics, but using mixed models of EI which have not been found to predict outcomes consistently. Consolidating psychometric data for two theoretical models will help build consistency of approach to the use of EI in psychometrics. In addition, the development of a way of measuring social work performance can contribute to the development of recruitment and selection of social workers. This research will develop knowledge about emotional intelligence amongst social work academics researching interpersonal aspects of social work practice. Interest amongst social work academics in emotional intelligence and social work practice has recently been shown from the networking event about emotional intelligence at the University of Bedford in May 2011. Empirical findings from this proposed study would contribute to the curriculum for training new and established social workers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168302</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short animation on effective coping strategies was created by Community Care Inform in 2017 from our coping strategies findings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4CA15142-82B2-4692-824E-A7B1EAAE3A60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This animation is part of a series of animations as part of e-learning resources made available to social workers by Community Care Inform (the UK's largest providers of online resources for social workers and social care professionals.)</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Coping strategies animation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwfLk-G9B-g&amp;feature=youtu.be</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Laura Biggart created a postcard using images and words which provide an easy and convenient reference guide to the research findings of coping strategies and developing the team as a secure base.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9497E465-9439-4183-8112-91F52CB8DE7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2625 postcards have been distributed by request to social workers across 23 different local authorities.

There is robust evidence showing those with higher Emotional Intelligence suffer less stress and burnout (Martins et al 2010). Emotional Intelligence is defined as: 
? Intrapersonal: able to recognise emotions in ourselves; able to manage our emotions 
? Interpersonal: able to recognise emotions in others; able to influence others' emotions 

This project investigated: the emotional demands of social work and how these are managed through interviews/focus groups (n63, n180); mapped characteristics of good social work practice from perspectives of social workers, supervisors, service users, educators and the professional capabilities framework through interviews/focus groups (n34); created a social work practice self assessment tool and validated it in two studies (n400, n210), developed and evaluated an Emotional Intelligence Training programme for social workers using a Randomised Control Trial (n210).

Emotional demands of child and family social work included: managing needs and expectations of parents, carers and children; experiencing and apprehension about experiencing verbal and physical aggression; meeting deadlines and targets, high caseloads, paperwork requirements; complex IT systems for recording; managing expectations of professionals and service users; managing boundaries between professional and personal identities; lack of organisation, supervisor and peer support and working in inappropriate workplace environments with inadequate resources.

Following the 2014 knowledge and skills guidance for child and family social workers (DfE 2014), a self-assessment of social work practice tool was developed, and validated in two studies, to aid reflective professional development which includes eight domains: Consultation and empathy, Analysis, Approach to learning, Adaptability, Cooperation, Coping, Organisational skills and Approach to exercising authority. 

The PI developed and evaluated a two day Emotional Intelligence Training course for child and family social workers in a 12 month randomised control trial examining whether Emotional Intelligence Training would reduce stress and burnout. Whilst training was positively rated for content, format and trainer, no significant differences in stress and burnout were found following EI Training. A descriptive trend for differences in coping strategies was found following training which warrants further investigation. 

Stressors significantly associated with increased stress and burnout for child and family social work were: high work demands, low job control, low Trait Emotional Intelligence, pressure to work with inadequate resources, pressure to meet deadlines, role clarity, little colleague, supervisor support.

Effective coping strategies used by social workers included: intrapersonal strategies (select situation, modify situation, change behaviour, physical exercise, changing thinking styles, modifying mood and distraction) and interpersonal strategies (Seek advice, seek others for emotion regulation, seek self-validation, seek help to reappraise, hold supportive team/colleagues in mind, feeling of belonging (team and/or organisation) believing that needs are recognised and met , believing that others care about my welfare and are available if needed). 

The study confirmed the feasibility of implementing a randomised control trial design in the social work profession. Participants and agencies were motivated to find out more about reducing burnout and promoting emotional resilience and welcomed the opportunity to trial new training resources.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>EI Training was well received by social workers considering the importance of emotions at work and on practice. Although this EI training format did not significantly reduce stress and burnout, it is suggested to offer follow up and embed training into workplace systems which provide one-to-one regular and ongoing support, e.g. through supervisors/practice educators. Given the strong association of work demands and working with inadequate resources on stress and burnout, it is recommended that employers also focus on addressing work demands and workplace environment. Online CPD tools will be developed in 2017. Further EI Training development by the PI and colleagues has started in health and teaching settings.

Introducing the self-assessment practice tool in CPD and supervision could provide a framework for focusing individual staff development.

Findings were presented to: 2015 Conference of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences; 2016 Conference of the European Social Work Research Association; the participating Local Authorities. A practitioner conference on 28 June 2016 includes a practitioner, academic and social work education plenary panel. A research briefing will be disseminated to the Learn to Care Network and Making Research Count, Principal Social Worker Network and the Association of Directors of Children's Services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AEDDB517-ECB1-4276-9F7A-D6AA4D7E724F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.uea.ac.uk/emotionsatwork</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CPD Training Social Work Practitioners - CAFCASS</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3B049BD-C533-405D-8858-15812D2F0E4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Delivered a half day session on Emotional Resilience based on materials developed from ESRC research on Emotional Intelligence in Social Work to CAFCASS (Norfolk and Suffolk) social workers, 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CPD Training Social Work Practitioners - Practice Educators</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB0BF91C-3349-4489-B1E8-4E5738184315</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since 2014, training for Practice Educators at Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire Children's Services now includes a half day session on Emotional Resilience based on materials developed from ESRC research on Emotional Intelligence in Social Work.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Reflective Supervision Resources - Research in Practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E24ACDEA-FB88-449E-9DC4-45BE12629ECF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This learning resource created by Research in Practice, a learning consultancy for social work contains the coping strategies tool developed from the ESRC Emotional Intelligence in Social Work research project.
