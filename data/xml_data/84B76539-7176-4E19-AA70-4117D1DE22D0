community dwelling people with mild to moderately severe dementia and their family carers, called the
Meeting Centres Support Programme (MCSP), in three EU countries: Italy, Poland and United Kingdom.
This evidence-based, person-centred, approach has been positively evaluated, and implemented
in 90 meeting centers in the Netherlands, and is now well-placed to be trialled and implemented in
other EU countries. Demonstrated benefits include high levels of user satisfaction, reduced behavioural
and mood problems, delayed admission to residential care, lower levels of caregiving-related
stress, higher carer competence, and improved collaboration between care and welfare organizations.
Project partners in the three countries will utilise strategies and tools developed in the Netherlands
and adapt them to country-specific requirements, establish a group of appropriate organizational
collaborators in each country, develop an implementation plan and toolkit, implement MCSP, and evaluate
the programme in a controlled trial in terms of its impact on the behaviour, mood and quality of
life of people with dementia and carers, its cost effectiveness as a result of changes in use of other
(more expensive) services, such as hospitals and residential care, and psychotropic medications. An
overall evaluation will draw together findings from the three implementation countries to develop
recommendations for successful implementation of the MCSP across the EU and beyond.
The project will be carried out over a 36 month period. In Phase One (M1-18) activities will focus on
establishing an initiative group of relevant organizations and user representatives in each country,
exploring pathways to care and potential facilitators and barriers to implementing the programme, and
developing country and context-specific implementation plans and materials. In Phase Two (M19-36)
training will be provided to organizations and staff, after which the meeting centres will be established
and evaluated for impact, cost-effectiveness, user satisfaction and implementation process</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>MEETINGDEM will provide a sustainable impact on both policy and practice: MCSP is a promising
innovative example of good practice regarding how care and welfare organizations and volunteers can
collaborate to provide comprehensive, integrated, high quality, cost-effective, accessible support to
people with dementia and carers, enabling them to live longer independently with a higher quality of
life. By adaptively implementing MCSP in other European countries, according to user needs, culture,
health and social care systems, substantial numbers of people with dementia and carers in these
countries can benefit from this system of support as well, while care providers and policy makers will
be provided with effective tools to face the challenges of dementia care in coming decades.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>314116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Royal Society of Medicine Symposium Medicine and Me: Living well with dementia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E492618A-E066-48B6-9B46-1C4731BF6954</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Medicine and Me' conferences are designed for patients, bringing them and their families together

1) New Meeting centres opened in Italy, Poland and UK (WP5)
In 2015 eight meeting centres were established: in Italy two in Milan, one in Sesto Giovanni, and three in Emilia Romagna (Bologna, Rimini, Riccione); in Poland one in Wroclaw; and in the UK one in Droitwich Spa. In 2016 six new Meeting Centers were opened: a third centre in Milan (Italy), one centre in Lecco (Lombardia region), one centre in Vignola (Emilia Romagna region) serving three small villages, a second and third centre in Wroclaw (Poland) and one centre in Leominster (UK). This means that in total during the MEETINGDEM project 14 Meeting Centres were set up. Furthermore, in all countries there are concrete plans for new meeting centres in other regions in the near future.

2) Report on process evaluation per country (D6.3)
The first two publications on the implementation process evaluation (one on the preparation phase in Milan (Italy) and one on the preparation phase in the three countries (I, PL, UK)) have been accepted by peer-reviewed scientific journals (the Journal of Gerontology and Geriatrics, Aging &amp;amp; Mental Health). A third paper on the process evaluation of the next phases of implementation (execution and continuation phase) was submitted to an international peer-reviewed journal in December 2016.

3) Data collection for (cost) effectiveness and user evaluation successful (WP6)
In December 2016 the data collection for the effect evaluation and cost effectiveness analy-sis was completed. All data were transferred to the WP6 leader (University of Worcester), who will perform the Effectiveness analysis and to London School of Economics who will do the economic evaluation. The numbers of data needed for a sufficiently powered effect anal-ysis were achieved: in the Meeting Centres pre- and post-test data were collected from 87 people with dementia and 94 family carers; in the usual care group pre- and post-test data were collected from 74 people with dementia and 75 family carers.
Also, the data collection for the user evaluation in the three countries was completed suc-cessfully.

4) MEETINGDEM congress presentations and journal publications (D7.3 and D7.6)
The MeetingDem project was presented and well received at several (inter)national con-gresses, such as at ADI in Budapest (Hungary) and the Alzheimer Europe conference in Co-penhagen (Denmark), at the Interdem meeting organised as pre-conference meeting of the Alzheimer Europe conference in Copenhagen, and the XLVII National Conference of SIN in Venice (Italy) and at XI National Conference of SINDEM in Firenze (Italy).
National dissemination event in each country (D7.6): Data were planned for the final dissem-ination events (D7.6) in the three countries where MCSP was implemented: Milan (Italy) 19 January 2017; Wroclaw (Poland) 27-28 February 2017, Worcester (United Kingdom) 21 March 2017.

A paper on the study design was prepared and submitted to a scientific journal as well as three papers on the process evaluation of the different phases of the implementation process in the three countries (I, PL, UK). Two of the process evaluation papers were accepted, and one has recently been published (in Aging &amp;amp; Mental Health in January 2017). 

5) A growing database with stakeholders in and outside Europe, interested in MCSP
A database was set up with names and addresses of stakeholders interested in MCSP. Dur-ing 2016 this database significantly increased from 14 interested stakeholders to 39 interested stakeholders from a growing number of European countries (Poland, Italy, UK, Spain, Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Belgium, Switzerland) and countries outside Europe (Chile, Mexico, China, Australia, Japan, South Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>46485F34-3A69-4953-9B7D-BB96ED5B41B9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have successfully implemented MCSP in UK, Italy and Poland adapting the model originally developed in the Netherlands.
This has consisted of the following actions and findings. 

T.5.1. 'Train the trainer' course: developed and ongoing
The 'train the trainers' course (also known as pioneer workshop) which had been developed in 2015, was provided to interested stakeholders in Italy, Poland and the UK in 2016. In Italy 1 workshops was organised; in Poland 1 whole day workshop (in Wroclaw) and 2 short version workshops (in L&amp;oacute;dz and Poznan) were organised; and in the UK 7 whole-day workshops were organised (in Worcester, London, Sheffield, Hereford, Brecon, Northampton and Burry Port). In total 7 stakeholders in Italy participated in the pioneer workshops, 70 stakeholders in Poland and 154 stakeholders in the UK.
The aim of the 'train the trainers' course&amp;quot; (pioneer workshop) is to disseminate and involve other organizations or people interested in setting-up a Meeting Centre Support Programme. A programme with the content of the workshop is available, as well as a basic set of slides presentation and a model of a letter of invitation. Other materials available for the pioneers are : country specific implementation plans, papers on the scientific results on MCSP and other documents needed for the dissemination (leaflets, brochures, etc). All countries also have made country specific films about the Meeting Centres which are publically available 

T.5.3: Implementation of the MCSP. 
In 2015 eight meeting centres were established: in Italy two in Milan, one in Sesto Giovanni, and three in Emilia Romagna (Bologna, Rimini, Riccione); in Poland one in Wroclaw; and in the UK one in Droitwich Spa. In 2016 six new Meeting Centres were opened: a third centre in Milan (Italy), one centre in Lecco (Lombardia region), one centre in the Vignola region (Emilia Romagna region) serving three small villages, a second and third centre in Wroclaw (Poland) and one centre in Leominster (UK). This means that in total during the MEETINGDEM project 14 Meeting Centres were set up. Furthermore, in all countries there are concrete plans for new meeting centres in other regions in the near future. 
In 2016 the planned activities of the MCSP (person-centred activities for people with dementia and carers) as well as the meetings with the staff and the organizations (advisory groups) have been undertaken consistently . Actions were undertaken in the different countries to organize structural financing for the continuation of the Meeting Centres after the ending of the MEETINGDEM project.

In Italy the following actions were undertaken and results achieved: in Milan a new association has been set up with the aim to promote and collect funding to support the meeting centres initiative and a non-profit foundation is involved and willing to support the initiative.
In the Emilia-Romagna region, the MCSP has been included in the regional plan for dementia and considered as an innovative action at the community level. In this way the Meeting centre can access dedicated funding for innovative actions as well as funding dedicated to welfare, in particular those dedicated to support care for older people. 

In Poland the following actions were undertaken and results achieved: An agreement between Wroclaw Medical University (WMU) with a welfare organisation (MOPS) was signed which ensures the continuation of MCSP, and The City Hall becomes responsible for structural financing from 2017. The long-term contracts for Meeting Center therapists were signed. Moreover, the agreement between WMU and MOPS provides advisory collaboration between these institutions. Joint plans for the further development of Meeting Centres are taken into account in 2017. In addition, the application for a national grant (POWER, a Ministry of Development grant) for the development of the idea of MCSP in cooperation with the WMU and MCUS (another welfare organisation) was submitted. 

In the UK the following actions were undertaken and results achieved: The national Alzheimer's Society agreed to fund the Droitwich Spa Meeting Centre from its general fund-raising. Funding has been secured for the purpose of establishing a national demonstration site through till 2018. Herefordshire County Council commissioned and funded the second Meeting Centre in Leominster (in the county of Herefordshire). This funding continues until March 2017. Within the UK, the Meeting Centre model fits well within the Dementia Friendly Community initiative which was promoted through Prime-Minister David Cameron's 2020 Vision for Dementia. Two locally organised Dementia Friendly Communities in Lutterworth and Brecon are now initiating Meeting Centres in their local towns funded through a mixture of local fund-raising and charitable grants. Plans are underway to form a national Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) with the aim of improving and supporting the lives of people affected by dementia by a) over-seeing the developing network of Meeting Centres in the UK and b) providing strategic oversight of the demonstrator site in keeping with the MCSP model as developed in the Netherlands. Part of the function of the CIO is to develop a sustainable funding model for Meeting Centres in the UK.

D 5.4: An adapted MCSP and toolkit for MCSP implementation.
Partners from each country have translated the Dutch Practical Guide for implementation of MCSP in 2014/2015, however the process of adapting the guide to country specific requirements was continued until summer 2016, taking into account the experience of preparing/ developing, starting and continuing the MCSP in each country. 
All adaptations made in the different countries were registered and will be reported in a deliverable (D5.4), based on which a paper for a journal will be prepared.

WP6:Evaluation of implementation
This work package has commenced in 2015 and is in progress with milestones being met. Final data collection has been completed in December 2016 and Data cleaning and analysis of baseline data and the user evaluation has been performed as well. Final data cleaning and analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness will take place in January-February. Final reporting in the form of scientific papers will take place in March-May 2017. 

T.6.1. Evaluation of efficacy and cost-effectiveness 
The efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the implemented MCSP is being evaluated (per country and overall international analysis) regarding the behaviour, mood and quality of life of people with dementia and sense of competence of their carers, delay of institutionalisation and changes in use of other services by means of a controlled trial (pre-test post-test control group design with matched patient-carer dyads) in which the MCSP will be compared with usual care (home care or another type of day care not supporting the carer) in each country. Data were collected, with the battery of methods and tools composed and agreed upon in 2015, in 9 Meeting Centres: 5 in Italy, 2 in Poland and 2 in the UK. Overall before-after anal-yses and comparative analysis between countries will be carried out to identify whether there are significant differences in outcomes between Meeting Centres and usual care, overall and between countries. 
The original data collection period was extended with two months (November/December 2016). The main reason for this was that one of the Meeting Centres had started at a later stage and therefore extra time was needed to collect the post test data in this centre. As a consequence data collection was completed late December, leaving two (instead of 4) months for the final data cleaning, analyses and reporting until the end of the project.. Neve-theless, it is expected that the reporting in the form of submitted and planned journal papers can be largely finalized before the final reporting deadline (31 May 2017) 3 months after the end date of the project (1 March 2017).

T.6.2 User evaluation 
In order to assess the opinions of the participants in the Meeting Centres on the support they receive, and on the various elements of the support programme, interviews/surveys were held by means of questionnaires for the person with dementia and the carer after three and six months of participation. The questionnaires were translated versions (Italian, Polish and English) of the ones which were used for the user evaluation among people with dementia and their carers visiting Meeting Centres in the Netherlands (Dr&amp;ouml;es et al, 2011). The people with dementia were interviewed orally (with this questionnaire) by an independent interviewer. In principle, the carers received the written questionnaire and were asked to fill it in them-selves and to send it directly to the researchers (and not to the staff of the Meeting Centre). This procedure was decided on, to prevent carers from giving socially preferable answers). In some cases, when carers needed support with filling in the questionnaire, they were also interviewed. This was the case with most carers in the UK. 
Besides this quantitative approach of data collection for the user evaluation, a qualitative evaluation approach was applied in at least one of the meeting centres per country/region (in total 5 Meeting Centres) by means of separate focus groups for people with dementia and carers to explore their experiences with the MCSP in the different countries. 

T.6.3. Evaluation of implementation process 
This task which commenced in 2015 with the development of the questionnaire on facilitators and barriers of implementation (based on the already existing questionnaire from the Dutch studies on the MCSP), and first interviews with key figures involved in the implementation of MCSP in the three countries Milan (Italy), Wroclaw (Poland) and Droitwich Spa (UK), was continued in 2016. The key figures were interviewed about preconditions and the preparation-, execution- and continuation phase of the implementation process. In Italy, a Masters student from the Netherlands (Marcelle van der Sanden; VU University Amsterdam) did her master thesis on the evaluation of the first phase of the implementation process in Italy in 2015. Based on her thesis in 2016 she submitted a paper to the (Italian) Journal of Gerontology and Geriatrics which was accepted for publication in January 2017. A Masters student from the University of Bologna (Floriana Mangiaracina), who did her internship within the MEETINGDEM Project at the VU University medical center in Amsterdam, studied and compared the preconditions and preparation phase in the three countries (I, PL, UK). She wrote her Master thesis on this as well as a journal paper that was accepted for publication in the special issue on Social Health in Dementia of Aging &amp;amp; Mental Health and published in January 2017. A final article on the evaluation of the implementation process (the execution and continuation phase) was recently submitted to a scientific journal.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In all of the countries involved the materials and know-how for setting up MCSP's have been established.

In the UK there is a database of 200 people who attended the pioneer workshops. A national conference is planned on 21 March in Worcester with the aim of presenting the key findings for the first time in the UK and to reflect on how this innovation for supporting people with dementia and their families could become part of the dementia care pathway in the UK.We will discuss how this innovation could impact on the dementia care post-diagnostic pathway; co-ordination of health and social care providers; Dementia Friendly Communities; Universities; Housing and workforce skills and competencies.
