It has been developed in close consultation with Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK and designed to feed into the Scottish Government's Marine Planning Interactive management tool, itself a valuable resource for the offshore industry. North Sea Interactive translates NERC environmental science from the British Geological Survey (BGS, surficial geology) and National Oceanography Centre (NOC, modelled hydrography) into a new Geographic Information System tool that incorporates the 40-year industry archive of benthic biology in the North Sea Benthos database (Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK/Heriot-Watt University, HWU). North Sea Interactive transfers people from NERC's research base through a series of consultations and secondments with Oil &amp;amp; Gas UK and the Scottish Government. These secondments allow us to develop North Sea Interactive as a practical tool, becoming a valuable Case Study for future development and extension to new exploration and production areas. North Sea Interactive will catalyse new ideas and Joint Industry Projects (JIPs). These include extensions to this project, such as incorporating additional biogeochemical parameters (e.g. pH, highly relevant to cuttings pile stability), through to using the North Sea Interactive approach in new areas such as the Atlantic Margins west of the UK.

North Sea Interactive relies on the long history and close working relationships between its partners and the oil industry. HWU has worked with the offshore industry since the early 1970s. The HWU team has over 60 years combined experience of oil industry projects representing a unique collective experience of compiling and assessing benthic biological data for the oil and gas industry. The University has a strong working relationship with industry evident not only from its Institute of Petroleum Engineering (JIPs income &amp;pound;4.5m pa; JIPs lasting up to 12yrs), but also from the success of its oil industry-related spin-out companis (e.g. Epistemy, Hydrafact, Hydrason, Petroc Technologies, SeeByte). The BGS has an unrivalled position as a valued source of geoscience and regional geological information for the oil industry. Relationships vary from one-off contracts with individual operators to large, long-terms JIPs such as the 1995-2006 Western Frontiers Association (15 companies, &amp;pound;2.7m industry funding) and the 1992-2010 Rockall Consortium (14 companies, &amp;pound;7.34M industry funding). BGS success in such JIPs has catalysed partnerships with international academic consortia, such as the EC STRATAGEM and COSTA programmes.

By providing a single tool that integrates NERC and oil industry environmental data, North Sea Interactive will assist operators in achieving best practicable environmental options (BPEO) for future oil field development, decommissioning options and post-decommissioning monitoring. It is designed to ensure ready access to high-quality NERC environmental data alongside industry datasets so helping companies meet their obligations (e.g. under the OSPAR Commission's national obligations to the 2010-14 Joint Assessment Monitoring Programme and the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive). It provides a model for future JIPs to integrate academic and industry data notably along the Atlantic Margins where there are knowledge gaps in understanding of deep-water ecosystems and vulnerabilities to oil and gas activities. 

By creating what we believe will become one of the densest shelf seas datasets integrating biological, geological and hydrodynamic information from industry and academia, North Sea Interactive will become a catalyst for many new ideas and initiatives. As well as future enhancements (e.g. biogeochemical data layers) and expansions (e.g. Atlantic Margin), these include interfacing with regional habitat mapping (e.g. MAREMAP), providing base layers to the renewables industry and raft of potential JIPs around environmental monitoring and decommissioning issues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64766</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oil and Gas UK Environment Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4DCF24BE-ED72-4839-B0C9-6FD6F8E03D3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alan Fox presented a talk:

The data was compiled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) - which enabled the creation of files, which can be visually mapped. The compiled data will be directly released to the Oil and Gas industry in November. The data will help to info industry environmental impact assessment studies and help towards future monitoring strategies and planning.
In addition, the project worked collaboratively with Oil and Gas Uk, ensuring that the data was presented in a manner suitable for the industry and with Marine Scotland to make layers compatible with the Scottish Governments National Marine Plan Interactive (NMPi). The data will be presented to the NMPi at the end of November, with possible inclusion following that meeting.
The work undertaken during this project have gone on to inform 2 additional NERC grants (KE Fellowship and the Innovation call).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AB11289F-E8A6-4A97-9EA6-135E16C27589</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The UK oil and gas industry have been collected environmental survey data for the seabed for the last 40 years. The data had been previously collated in the early 2000's into an Access database that was updated every year, or every other year. Although all the data was in one place, it was difficult to interpret or visualise. This project was tasked to convert the database into a format that could be mapped (Geographic Information Software); whilst also combing it with datasets from BGS (seabed sediment) and NOC (Bed stress, temperature, salinity). Although no formal data analysis was conducted during this project, the aims of the project were to map the expanse of industry data, which had not been done before. The resulting maps and data are available online (see below) and will be released to the industry in November.
It is hoped that the data will also be incorporated within the Scottish Government's National Marine Plan Interactive (NMPi) - this tool enables viewers to access different types of information and data to assist in the development of national and regional marine planning.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research grant was the catalyst for the NERC Knowledge Exchange Fellowship (Oil and Gas) application - the fellowship will extend upon the work already undertaken. Additional data will be collated from both industry and research and compiled into an interactive online forum. It will work alongside the researchers, regulators and operators and would hopefully aim to influence how operators collect and record their monitoring findings, while also making industry data more freely available to a wider audience.
The project also lead to the development and successful winning of the NERC Oil and Gas Innovation grant, which will look to expand and build upon this project, by combinging lpong-term measurements of ocean temperature, salinity, bed-stress, with data on benthos from the Atlantic Margin, therefore permitting us to map and measure baseline levels of variability.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FCE47089-1447-41FC-9403-2EC01CB6681F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.northseainteractive.hw.ac.uk/research/research2.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Decision support tool for the Offshore Oil and Gas industry by creating a geographic resource from existing environmental data.
