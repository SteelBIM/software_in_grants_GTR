It offers true multiplex imaging of protein distribution and allows access to tissue chemistry without the need of conventional staining. Unfortunately, this technique has long been plagued by the notoriously low intensity of the Raman signal and the inherent background noise found in biological samples. Recent advances in non-linear Raman techniques, such as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering and stimulated Raman scattering have allowed these problems to be partially resolved by increasing the signal strength. These new techniques, however, suffer from the very high cost of conventional laser systems, making them inaccessible to a large number of research laboratories. The current research proposal puts forwards the development of a new type of stimulated Raman scattering microscope powered by three modern technologies: inexpensive supercontinuum laser source, surface-enhanced Raman substrates and automated analysis based on spectral clustering. This radical new approach will allow this technique to be available at a fraction of the current price, making it affordable to a wide range of biomedical imaging applications. Combined with surface-enhanced Raman substrates made from gold nanoparticles, we will demonstrate that background-free chemical maps can be obtained in a fraction of the time currently possible. We will test the potential use of this instrument for cell and tissue imaging with future applications in cancer diagnosis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Optical imaging is an essential core technology in biomedical research and will play a key role in unravelling the complex networks of biomolecular interactions that underpin normal cell functions. The next generation of non-linear optical imaging tools will enable the development of novel molecular biomarkers that report aberrant function and design therapeutic interventions to correct them. The proposed research concerns the development of surface-enhanced stimulated Raman microscopy analysed by modern clustering algorithms as part of a radical new technology which will address many of the major outstanding limitations in the application and exploitation of proteomics. The exploitation of this inexpensive and versatile non-linear optical technique based on Raman spectroscopy will enable the development of new minimally-invasive approaches to the diagnosis of disease with a focus on early cancer prognosis. This proposal aims to speed the translation of basic discovery science to the development of new drugs and diagnostics in the commercial and clinical settings, with major implications for the economy and health of the UK. Health / Societal benefits: The use of our technology for the understanding of protein functions is directly relevant for all areas of Biological sciences with vast potential benefits in medicine, from cancer and immune diseases, to hospital infections. The technologies we are proposing to develop will also allow the full potential of Raman-based optical diagnosis to be realised. Unsupervised tissue screening will help pathologists grade reliably tumour progression while direct clinical use will assist surgeon in tumour extraction via the ability of Raman spectroscopy to differentiate between healthy/cancerous tissue. This proposal aims to be directly relevant in the long-term aim of addressing healthcare in society, reducing the financial burden of the NHS via early cancer diagnosis and targeted therapy. The investigator's close collaborators within the Research Oncology Department will be directly involved in the adoption and dissemination of this novel technique within the pathologist community. Commercial Impact: We are ultimately aiming to develop and design the tools for end users such as the biophotonics research community, the pharmaceutical industry for drug discovery and high-throughput tissue screening for disease diagnosis. There is the potential to directly benefit UK industry, either through the creation of dedicated start-up companies or by licensing for the creation of new products. Our group is very commercially aware and has had numerous successful collaborations with major companies. The principal investigator has strong support from the university technology transfer office and his research group (B3) has previous experience in the successful creation of a start-up company. We will approach our relevant commercial partners and organise demonstrations of the proposed instrument to assess the potential use of our new technology towards their research interests. Exploitation and Dissemination: King's College London technology transfer office will assist in the identification of commercially exploitable outputs from the proposed research, which will then be managed by KCL Business which is well-versed in these issues. Educational and Training Impact: It is not just sufficient to develop new biophotonics tools and place them in the biology laboratory. The key to successful research is the skill of the personnel to operate and understand them, and to have an appropriate background for the interpretation of the data. We will address this need by training appropriate biologists in this novel imaging technique to advance their ability to model the biophysical environment and develop novel biological and clinical assays.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>192510</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>European Metrology Research programme (EMRP) in Raman scattering - Researcher Excellence Grant (REG) in coherent Raman</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission (EC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Researcher Excellence Grant (REG) in coherent Raman</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1641868D-023F-4CC4-8BF4-B4A0C47B9076</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>93656</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>European Metrology Research programme (EMRP) in Raman scattering - Multiphoton Spectral Imaging of Drug Intake in Cells</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission (EC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>NEW02-REG3</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>ADFDCD48-7FAD-4045-973C-2E5F8A1CA7D3</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The principal aim of this project was to build a Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) microscope based on a relatively affordable, commercially available, supercontinuum laser source. We have found that this recent technology is currently not well suited for this type of microscopic application. The main reasons for this low suitability are:



1) Although the overall output power of such laser systems is very high (2 - 4 W), it is spread over a very large spectral range (500 nm to 1700 nm) while only a relatively small portion of it can be used for SRS, typically 750 nm to 900 nm in our case.

2) The relatively long duration (around 10 ps) of the laser pulse coming out of the long photonic crystal fibre does not provide sufficient peak power to produce reliable SRS loss/gain signals.

3) The general noise and stability of this type of supercontinuum laser source is too poor for accurate measurements of long Raman spectra and large single peak Raman maps.

4) A narrow region of the supercontinuum is selected using a monochromator to generate the pump beam. The shape of this beam is elongated due to the shape of the monochromator slit, leading to very poor spatial overlap between the pump beam and the Raman Stoke beam.



The original design proposed in the grant application has been modified to the following: A state-of-the-art automated Titanium/Sapphire femtosecond laser pumps a tailor-made photonic crystal fibre to produce a continuum concentrated in the region suitable for SRS. The femtosecond pulses combined with the high power from the Ti/Sapph laser, provides a combined peak power suitable for SRS. The monochromator has been replaced by a fixed-wavelength high-quality narrow-bandpass interference filter, resulting in a clean Gaussian beam shape for proper spatial beam overlap. The tunnability of the SRS system is provided by the automated tuning of the Ti/Sapph laser. The downside of this modified design is the need of an expensive Ti/Sapph laser source.



The secondary aim of this project was to modify an existing spectral clustering algorithm to be able to analyse large dataset (&amp;gt;1 M) from a variety of Raman instruments: conventional spontaneous Raman, SRS and Coherent Antistoke Raman (CARS). We have successfully demonstrated that up to 5 different fluorescent beads can be demultiplexed from a broadband CARS microscope, paving the way to true multiplexed protein distribution imaging using conventional fluorescence tagging technologies. We have also shown that this analytical tool can separate the 3 different types of dentine (sound/infected/affected) from unstained histological sections of caries lesions imaged using spontaneous Raman spectroscopy. Such stain-free optical characterisation will provide a unique tool to accurately assess the remineralisation effects of novel tooth restoration materials and can potentially have a huge impact on the treatment of caries, improving of the population's oral health.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Others should not rely on this particular type of laser excitation source to do
