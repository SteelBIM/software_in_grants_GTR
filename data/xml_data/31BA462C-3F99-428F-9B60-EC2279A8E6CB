Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I003622/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project aims to unlock the potential, for scholarly and public benefit, of the outstanding collections of Fijian art, material culture and associated archives and photographs held in UK and other museums. Originating from Britain's voyaging, missionary and colonial ties with Fiji, these extensive collections, hitherto neglected, will be systematically researched, analysed and made the focus of major publications, exhibitions and outreach activities. \n\nFijian artworks are visually impressive and beautifully made; they include sculptures in wood and ivory, shell and ivory regalia, ritual equipment, weapons, pottery and large decorated textiles. Central to pre-Christian and post-conversion religious practices, and often heavily Tongan-influenced, many of these objects played an active role in relations with the British, resulting in significant collections in UK museums. Foremost are the Fijian collections at the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (MAA), probably the most important in the world. With over 2,500 objects, 2000+ photographs, diaries, field notes and drawings, they include items from all periods of Fijian history since the late 18th century as well as extensive material from the early colonial period (1870s-90s). Other outstanding collections are in the British Museum, Pitt Rivers Museum Oxford, World Museum Liverpool, National Museum of Scotland and Maidstone Museum, while major overseas collections are in Paris, Salem, the Smithsonian Institution and the Fiji Museum. All 9 museums are collaborating with the project as official Project Partners. Many regional UK museums (in Aberdeen, Exeter, Ipswich, Birmingham and elsewhere) will also participate; the National Archives will also be a valuable resource. \n\nBuilding on the specialist expertise of project staff, working in partnership with UK and overseas museums (including the Fiji Museum), the project will:\n\n- Provide the first comprehensive history of Fijian art.\n- Contribute greater understanding of the enduring potency of Fijian artworks and exchange valuables.\n- Extend theoretical perspectives on the nature of exchange, and of object/person relations more widely, including analyses of gender, embodiment, equivalence, shrines and relics.\n- Provide a nuanced history of collecting which will illuminate complex and shifting Fijian/British relations, especially during the early colonial period (1870s-90s).\n- Elucidate trends in British intellectual and academic history through analysis of field collecting in Fiji and its implications for the development in Britain of major museums and the discipline of anthropology.\n- Enhance existing museum documentation with expert identification and analysis of collections, while linking key museums internationally.\n- Improve the ability of museums to display and interpret their collections for multiple audiences.\n- Disseminate research results to diverse specialist and public audiences, including UK-based Fijians, through publications, symposia and several exhibitions with associated educational outreach activities. \n- Contribute to museum/academic training programmes by holding workshops/curators' forum, and by involving 40+ graduate students in project-related course assignments.\n- Contribute insights for policy makers into the importance for understanding contemporary Fijian politics of historically-rooted relationships between chiefdoms. \n\nThe project team, led by UEA's Professor Steven Hooper, a Fiji specialist and Fijian-speaker with over 30 years research experience, includes Dr Anita Herle, Senior Curator at MAA, who will oversee research on MAA's Fiji collections. Other participants include former and current Fiji Museum Directors Fergus Clunie and Sagale Buadromo, and MAA Director Professor Nicholas Thomas (a renowned Pacific specialist; chair of the project Advisory Committee); all will contribute to numerous publications, exhibitions and other outputs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Enhance museum resources: \nMuseums will be the main institutional beneficiaries. Research conducted by project specialists on Fijian collections held in many UK museums will be fed directly back to holding institutions. In addition to project partner museums, at least 20 other UK museums have significant Fijian material. The development and transfer of specialist knowledge will enable museums to identify objects and greatly improve display, documentation, interpretation, management and care of Fijian and other non-western collections.\n\nEnhance visitor experience, increase visitor numbers, transfer knowledge:\nProject outputs include the development of several distinct exhibitions aimed at diverse audiences (numbering 100,000+). A major exhibition at Cambridge will be accompanied by numerous outreach activities, aimed at schools, artists, families and community groups, including those at risk of social exclusion. A planned second major exhibition, drawing on the collections of partner institutions, will bring together for the first time an extraordinary range of Fijian art for national and international audiences. A new Fijian display in the Wellcome Gallery at the British Museum will join those showing how diverse cultural groups maintain social, physical and spiritual well-being. The provision of special Exhibition Packages with National Curriculum-based teacher's packs and other outreach materials will enable regional museums to optimise their Fijian and Pacific collections for public display. Several museums have expressed enthusiasm for such Packages. Increased visitor numbers, with increased catalogue and other sales, will bring direct economic benefit to many museums. \n\nFacilitate development of sustainable professional networks:\nThe development of productive and sustainable links between museum partners will greatly facilitate communication between specialist project researchers, curators, museum educators and host institutions. In addition to the invaluable benefit for the proposed project, the network will encourage skill sharing and collaboration on future projects. \n\nStimulate creative output:\nThe display of outstanding works of Fijian art to broad museum audiences throughout the UK will stimulate appreciation and creative output, particularly in the visual arts. The production of the exhibition at MAA will include an artist-in-residency with the results incorporated into the display.\n\nEncourage communities to engage with their past:\nThe project's goals have particular relevance to British Fijians and Pacific Islanders more broadly in providing a publicly accessible visual and documentary history of Fijian art and culture in multiple media. Community representatives will be encouraged to participate actively in the project, enriching the presentation of Fijian art and culture and encouraging widening participation.\n The project and its various outputs will explore complex colonial histories and legacies. Fiji is an unusual case. For reasons anchored in local politics, influential Fijian chiefs petitioned for Fiji to become a British colony. Sir Arthur Gordon, the first Governor (1874-80), developed a controversial policy of indirect rule and encouraged many traditional cultural activities. The exhibitions will foster broader historical understandings of the nature of the British Empire and tolerance in contemporary multicultural societies such as Fiji and the UK. \n\nPolicy making and international relations: \nOverall, the project aims to encourage positive international relations with Fiji and the Pacific Islands through better understandings of the historical processes underlying relations between chiefdoms in Fiji and between Fijians and outsiders, including the British and indentured Indian settlers.

Advised by members of the Fijian Art Research Project, Far Side of the World: Torquay's Fijian Connection, was one of the project's exhibition packages, curated locally by Barry Chandler. The aim of the exhibition packages was to enable regional museums to optimise their Fijian collections for public display. Some museums chose to have larger exhibitions, which led the project team to consider these exhibitions as double packages (allowing the project to give double the amount of the allocated budget for an exhibition package, enabling a larger exhibition).

All participants shared skills and knowledge.

The creations produced during the 4-day workshop were put on display in the Oceania Centre at the University of South Pacific.

These materials are held in numerous museums whose collections have been visited and studied, in the UK (notably at Cambridge and the British Museum), and in the USA, New Zealand and Fiji. We have developed an extensive network of relations and this is regularly activated by our project website and a busy Facebook page which is heavily used by Fijians in Fiji as well as UK-based Fijians. We have developed exhibitions, including a series of exhibition packages developed in collaboration with a number of UK museums, and numerous outreach activities. We especially value our collaboration with the Fiji Museum (where we co-curated an exhibition for local audiences), and the support of the Fiji Government (both the President and Prime Minister of Fiji visited the collections and exhibition in Cambridge, as well as the Fiji High Commissioner and the UK High Commissioner to Fiji). 

Through our major exhibition Fiji: Art &amp;amp; Life in the Pacific at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts (2016-2017), we have discovered strong interest in heritage among UK-based Fijians. The exhibition garnered widespread attention and a version of it is under discussion to be shown in 2019 at the Los Angeles Count Museum of Art. Los Angeles is not only a major Pacific rim city, it has a large Pacific Islander population for whom the exhibition would be attractive and instructive.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Based on our research, and as a direct result of the project's activities, the largest and most comprehensive exhibition never mounted about Fiji and Fijian art was shown at the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts (14 Oct 2016 - 12 Feb 2017). This was opened by the President of Fiji and visited by Her Majesty The Queen. This has been very well received, so is likely to lead to a one-, two- or three-venue version of the exhibition being shown in the USA in 2019-2020. Research results and information about Fijian canoes is proving valuable to Fijian canoe builders. An 8m long double-hulled sailing canoe has been funded by the Bundeskunsthalle in Bonn, Germany, and discussions are underway for the building of a second high quality canoe, contributing to the reassessment of the importance of canoes as carbon-free means of transport in the Fiji islands. The existing canoe may be shown during the November 2017 COP23 UN Climate Change Conference in Bonn, Germany, which will be attended by many thousands of delegates. In addition to these specific outcomes, we anticipate that Pacific art specialists, and especially Fijians, will benefit from the results of our research, by developing greater understandings of, and respect for, the achievements of Fijian artists and craftspeople past and present.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>79702329-618C-473C-B77E-A424F0A7938B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.fijianart.sru.uea.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professor Hooper: Adviser and Consultant on Strategic Plan for Fiji National Museum and Botanical Gardens</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Australia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>664DC59F-4938-4D0C-87C7-28C498ADD964</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Project staff studied Fiji collections in various museums in the UK and abroad and always shared their findings with the museums so that staff could integrate these into their existing databases.
