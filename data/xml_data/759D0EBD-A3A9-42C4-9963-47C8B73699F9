These elegant animals are one of natural history's puzzles because, despite their name, they are not of European origin: they are native to Turkey from where people have gradually transported them around the globe. The distribution of fallow deer is thus a direct record of human population movements, trade and ideology with the potential to provide cultural evidence of the highest quality and relevance for a range of disciplines and audiences.\n\nThere are many publications devoted to fallow deer but these largely recycle 'received wisdom'. In fact, astonishingly little is known about fallow deer; their history is obfuscated by ambiguous linguistic, textual, iconographic and archaeological evidence. To rectify this situation we carried out a pilot study, The Fallow Deer Project, whose results have challenged established theories about the species' history and provided new insights into Roman, Anglo-Saxon and Norman society. It also highlighted the scarcity of scientific work on fallow deer and demonstrated how a new dataset will enable us to explore some of the highest-profile issues in European archaeology: e.g. the nature and spread of the Neolithic in the eastern Mediterranean and the structure and worldview of societies in the Bronze Age Aegean, Iron Age Greece and Gaul, and the Roman, Byzantine, Islamic and Norman Empires.\n\nTo realise this potential, our transdisciplinary team will employ methods proven by our pilot study - e.g. the integration of archaeology, history, geography and anthropology with genetics, stable isotope analysis and osteological research - to answer the following questions:\n\n1) Were fallow deer domesticated? \nDomestication is a high-profile topic but it has been overlooked in relation to D. d. dama. Interestingly, unlike cattle, sheep or horses, fallow deer provide no milk, wool or traction to warrant their maintenance, yet most archaeological Dama lived into old age - what prompted different human groups to form close, long-term relationships with this species?\n\n2) Under what circumstances were fallow deer established across Europe? \nFallow deer translocation seemingly began in the Neolithic and by the Bronze Age they were established throughout the Aegean. They appear to have held a magico-religious status that endured into the Iron Age and Roman period, when their bones were traded as holy relics. This trade has confused understanding of Dama biogeography but our research indicates that the Romans established the species across Europe. We now need to clarify how, from where and why these animals/body parts were transported.\n \n3) Did the collapse of the Roman Empire cause extirpation of fallow deer? \nEvidence for fallow deer is scarce in early medieval Europe; however, they may have been present but simply not exploited by people. The results of this question will be considered further in questions 4 and 5. \n\n4) Did the Normans reintroduce fallow deer via Islamic influence?\nThe idea that fallow deer, the Arabic concept of parks and new hunting rituals were exported from the Norman Kingdom of Sicily is based on circumstantial evidence. We will examine all available data from the Islamic and Christian medieval world either to confirm existing beliefs and provide insights into the culture-contact of this period, or to indicate that Roman Dama populations endured in pre-Norman Europe, necessitating a re-assessment of the Norman Conquest's impact. \n\n5) How do human-Dama relationships reveal worldview?\nIt has been shown repeatedly that the relationship between humans and wild animals reflects a society's structure and beliefs. Certainly wherever fallow deer were translocated, they were incorporated into expressions of socio-cultural identity and ideology. We will explore how different human groups negotiated status, gender, religious and cultural beliefs through interactions with fallow deer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our pilot project highlighted three main non-academic groups with whom we wish to engage: 1) general public, 2) primary school children, 3) those involved with deer management, conservation and legislation\n\n1. General public. Fallow deer are as much a part of Europe's cultural heritage as the more visible monuments of Stonehenge or Fountains Abbey but, because they are abundant and widespread, their cultural significance is overlooked. Yet it is their very familiarity that makes fallow deer engaging cultural and educational resources- they can be accessed by anyone. Our pilot study demonstrated that fallow deer have considerable public appeal: our contributions to the British Deer Society's magazine were very well received by the BDS's 5,300 membership (we were contacted by a large number of members) with one article requested for re-publication in another general interest magazine 'Saxon'. Growing interest in introduced species is reflected by the BBC, who are planning a new series on the history of Britain, told through the stories of animal extinctions and invasions (linked to O'Connor and Sykes 2010 - see Sykes CV). We plan to collaborate with the BBC on this series but are proposing a range of other activities to disseminate our research to the public (see Pathways to Impact)\n\n2. Primary school children. Our project fits well with the English history curriculum, particularly Key Stage 2 (Roman Impact) and Key Stage 3 (Norman Conquest and the Crusades). We will work with education officers from at least three UK museums, providing them with teaching packs/educational resources to complement their existing activities (Pathways to Impact).\n \n3. Deer management, conservation and legislation\nToday deer are a serious economic, environmental and political issue with debate surrounding their impact, management and conservation - contentious issues that can all be addressed through studies of the past. This is exemplified by modern British deer legislation: existing laws have their origins in Roman/medieval codes that were established to address issues of the time (e.g. poaching) but bear little relevance to current concerns, e.g. damage to natural heritage sites and deer collisions on our roads. Phillip et al. (2009) have shown how historical analyses of deer numbers, environmental change and the changing legal framework are vital for informing contemporary debate over sustainable deer management. To this end Dama International will work with national organisations (the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, RELU and the Forestry Commission are all involved in our Deer and People conference) to offer a long-term perspective on deer management and new ways forward for modern deer legislation. \n\nWe will actively collaborate with deer managers, briefing them on the significance of fallow deer and providing information on the origin and diversity of their regional populations - issues key to the development of effective management strategy. They will also be trained in the collection of DNA samples so that they might engage directly in our research. \n\nImportantly, we will address deer conservation; for although domestic Dama have a worldwide distribution, they are almost extinct in the wild. There is just one surviving 'native' population, living free at Termessos National Park in Turkey: the IUCN Red List of threatened species classifies this herd as 'under serious threat' and requiring 'strong anti-poaching measures, recovery management and re-introductions'. Our project will publicise Termessos's conservation efforts and, through the collection of genetic material, help preserve this vulnerable herd, especially by assessing levels of inbreeding and gauging its effective size - both by-products of the broader DNA study (Pathways to Impact).\n\nPhillip et al. 2009.

The Sussex Archaeological Society were the first group to invest in this project's PI (Sykes), providing the initial funding (&amp;pound;700) to radiocarbon date the fallow deer remains from Fishbourne Roman Palace.

Following the unmaking that our team oversaw on the Saturday, the Attingham Park were able to run their own unmaking on the second day.

We taught them about the history and archaeology of fallow deer, how their introduction is a legacy of an aristocratic hunting culture (also responsible for the introduction of unusual hunting rituals but also the extermination of top predators), how deer management is a problem in the UK and that there is no market for wild venison.

Following medieval hunting manuals, we worked to 'unmake' (skin and butcher) the deer. The pupils then worked with chefs (one from NUSA and one 'celebrity chef' - Valentine Warner) to cook the venison into a tasty meal for their parents.

One of the days was filmed for the BBCs Great British Food Revival, aired in October 2012. The second day was attended by a reporter from The Independent, who wrote up the project for an article published on 2nd November 2012.

This generated interest and we were asked to write a feature about our work for the University of East Anglia's ThoughtOut project

As before, all of the children took part in the butchery, cooking, eating of the venison but they also created medieval-inspired artworks.

The artworks were digitised by students from the University of Nottingham and turned into a handbook explaining the medieval unmaking procedure. This handbook was created in collaboration with the National Trust for use at NT unmaking events. 

As before, the pupils learnt about the need for deer management and the benefits of wild venison consumption.

Over the last few years we have become aware that the most effective impact occurs when all three are merged, which has led to the establishment of 4) the 'Fair Game Initiative'.

1. General public. Fallow deer are as much a part of Europe's cultural heritage as the more visible monuments of Stonehenge or Fountains Abbey but, because they are abundant and widespread, their cultural significance is overlooked. Yet it is their very familiarity that makes fallow deer engaging cultural and educational resources - they can be accessed by anyone. Our contributions to the British Deer Society's (BDS) magazine have been very well received by the BDS's membership, with one article requested for re-publication in another general interest magazine 'Saxon'. We have made all these articles available for download on our project's website. The BDS has altered the education pages of their website to reflect our research findings, including links to our 30 minute documentary about the bio-cultural history of the fallow deer.

We have made a number (n=4) of shorter property-specific films for the National Trust (NT) about their fallow deer herds, and we carried out public engagement activities for another NT property. We have installed two major exhibitions at the independent museums of Fishbourne Roman Palace and Dudley Castle Museum. 

2. Primary school children. Our project fits with Key Stage 2 (Roman Impact) and Key Stage 3 (Norman Conquest and the Crusades) of the English history curriculum and we are working with the education officers from the historic properties mentioned above to provide teaching packs/educational resources to complement their existing activities. The work we did in collaboration with these museums was also utilized by 'School Science', who created an on-line module about our research, including clips from our documentary film. In addition, we have run activities at the Nottingham University Samworth Academy, which was filmed for the BBC program detailed below. 

3. Deer management, conservation and legislation. Deer managers are playing an important role in our research, many of them engaging directly in data collection by providing us with DNA samples from modern populations. In return, we have been briefing them on the significance of fallow deer: we have given talks to deer management groups across the country, providing them with information about the origin and diversity of their regional populations - issues key to the development of effective management strategies. Today deer are a serious economic, environmental and political issue with debate surrounding their impact, management and conservation - contentious issues that can all be addressed through studies of the past. We have working with the British Deer Society, the Deer Initiative, the Ministry of Defence, the Small Woods Association and the National Trust's deer managers to show how the long term perspective provided by our research, and our arts and humanities approach, can be used to make the issue of deer management understandable to the public - recent government papers highlights lack of public understanding to be the main hurdle to sustainable deer management. 

Importantly, we are addressing deer conservation; for although domestic Dama have a worldwide distribution, they are almost extinct in the wild. There is just one surviving 'native' population, living free at Termessos National Park in Turkey: the IUCN Red List of threatened species classifies this herd as 'under serious threat' and requiring 'strong anti-poaching measures, recovery management and re-introductions'. We are currently involved in authoring the IUCN Red List entry for the European Fallow Deer (forthcoming). As a result of our project it is now clear that the history of Dama dama dama cannot be considered in isolation from that of the Persian fallow deer (Dama dama mesopotamica) and our team members (Drs Baker and Daujat) have recently co-authored the IUCN Red List entry for this endangered species also http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6232/0 

4) Fair Game Initiative. This educational outreach project brings together all the above strands. We use our arts and humanities research to engage the public in the history of fallow deer, their environmental impact and the need for sustainable management. Our approach is hands-on: we take complete fallow deer carcasses to schools, pubs and heritage institutions and, after an introductory lecture, follow medieval texts to butcher and cook the venison. We are working with the National Trust to establish this as part of both their deer management and educational programme. This part of our project is attracting considerable media interest being showcased by Channel 4's Time Team (April 2012), BBC's Great British Food Revival (October 2012) and featured in The Independent (Nov 2012), with many more write-ups in smaller interest journals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C86EE182-E589-4FD7-B9BC-926A27F38DB3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>At the start of this project, our hypothesis - based on existing literature and research - was that all modern European fallow deer (Dama dama dama) around the world descended from an Anatolian glacial refuge population. By bringing together evidence from the Arts, Humanities and Sciences, our project can now reject this hypothesis with confidence. 

The story of the fallow deer's diffusion is far more complex. It involves deer populations that are now extinct due to over-hunting, and it involves culture-contact that was hitherto unknown on the basis of material culture studies.

We have been able to demonstrate that, across time and space, fallow deer have held important, but varied, social and cultural positions. In the Near East and the Balkans they were initially quarry, hunted alongside other wild mammals by the hunter-gatherers of the Mesolithic period. In the Neolithic, it would appear that attempts were made to domesticate fallow deer, with closer relationships being evident between deer and people. As part of this, populations were moved to off-shore Mediterranean islands, which later became the settings for Bronze Age hunting.

It was during the Bronze Age that fallow deer appear to have become religious symbols, being closely aligned with the goddess Artemis, evidenced by the iconography, material culture and the contexts in which fallow deer remains are recovered. 

We now believe that it was the association between fallow deer and Artemis (as well as her later incarnation as Roman Diana) that was responsible for the spread of fallow deer across Roman Europe. 

This Roman diffusion of fallow deer took the species to Italy, across to western Europe and up through northern Europe to Britain. Whilst the Roman-introduced populations endured in southern and western Europe, we now know that the populations established in Roman Britain went completely extinct when the Empire withdrew. 

Our evidence points to a reintroduction in the 11th century AD, most probably from south-east Europe. Previously it was believed that the reintroduction was linked to the Norman Conquest; however, our results would suggest that this may not be the case. The introduction appears to be pre-Conquest, with implications for our understanding of early medieval culture contact, ideology and landscape.

These pre-Conquest deer were taken to Ireland in the Anglo-Norman period (12th/13th century) and were later transported back across the English Channel, becoming established across northern Europe. During the height of the British Empire, fallow deer were taken from England as far afield as the Caribbean, notably to the island of Barbuda where fallow deer are, today, the island's national symbol.

Aside from understanding the cultural heritage of the species, this project has made significant scientific findings concerning the biology, genetic make-up and conservation requirements of global fallow deer populations. We have generated extensive new ancient and modern genetic, isotopic and metric data-sets for the European and Mesopotamian fallow deer. These data are all publicly available and will underpin research for years to come. 

This project has highlighted the importance of animal studies (so often over-looked in archaeological research) to understanding the migration patterns, practices and ideologies of past cultures, for rendering these findings relevant to the present and utilizing them to predict future issues of cultural and biological conservation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are significant not only for understanding the ideology and environmental impact of past cultures but also for the present and future. The results of our study are of direct relevance for modern deer management and conservation (neither of these can be considered in isolation from human culture - see Sykes and Putman 2014) but also for issues of food security. 

Our results are already being showcased in two museum exhibitions (Fishbourne Roman Palace and Dudley Castle Museum) and have been converted into four short films for National Trust properties, with more to follow. The National Trust's deer managers have been trained in our research and approach to outreach. Several properties are now using the resources we have provided them with to deliver their own educational programmes, concerning the cultural heritage represented by their deer herds but also the benefits of eating their venison.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>122CB820-FAE5-4F79-80D2-7C81B4D96F7B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.fallow-deer-project.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Authorship of IUCN Red List entry for Dama mesopotamica</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BE047C68-8083-4354-BAEC-9479212624CA</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/6232/0</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training National Trust Deer Managers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>585F7CF2-8866-4A1B-A1D4-486AC577A6A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We spent two days training the National Trust (NT) deer managers in the rationale and methods of our research, highlighting the cultural and economic value of the fallow deer on their properties.
