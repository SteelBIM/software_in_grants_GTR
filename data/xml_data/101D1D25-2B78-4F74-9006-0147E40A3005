Proposal</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J019135/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The LLAKES Research Centre is now in its second phase of funding, and continues to investigate the role of lifelong learning in promoting economic competitiveness and social cohesion. The research programme has been reorganised into three Themes (replacing the Strands of Phase 1) in order to enhance the use of mixed methods in our research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Each of the three Themes involves multiple levels of analysis, drawing on the methods of different disciplines to focus on separate levels (eg Psychology on the individual level, and Comparative Political Economy on the macro level).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Theme 1 - ?Youth, Intergenerational Mobility and Civic Values? - is led by Karen Evans, and focuses on the opportunities, social mobility and civic values of young people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Theme 2, on ?Learning, Work and the Economy?, is led by Francis Green, and deals with relationships between the organisation of work, patterns of learning and skill, and economic performance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Theme 3 is entitled: ?Education, Inequality and Social Cohesion?; it is led by Germ Janmaat, and concentrates on the different models of lifelong learning in various countries, and the mechanisms by which these varying approaches impact on skills distribution, social inheritance, civic values and social cohesion, at national and regional scales&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The LLAKES Centre's research focuses on the contribution of lifelong learning to the economic competitiveness and social cohesion at local, regional and national levels. This means we work closely with a wide range of people and organisations across the public and private sectors and from national government through to voluntary organisations, local authorities and employers. At the international level, our research is used by organisations such as the European Commission, CEDEFOP and the OECD. 

We include the academic community in our list of users, but here we focus on other types of users. Our research will have particular relevance for:

a) Policy-makers and research analysts in UK government departments (DfE, BIS, DWP, Treasury, Cabinet Office, Home Office, DCLG) and in government agencies, including, for example, the National Health Service

b) Professionals in local authorities, education and training institutions, youth services, Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs), Chambers of Commerce; and in other organizations with responsibility for economic and social development at the local and regional levels

c) Private sector employers, industry and sector-based bodies, and the trade unions

d) Charities, voluntary organizations, and social enterprises

How will they benefit from this research?

Our research will be of benefit to 'users' who want to increase their understanding of the role of lifelong learning in enhancing individual opportunities and well-being and in promoting economic competitiveness and social cohesion at local, regional and national levels. Research on economic and social phenomena is often carried out in separate spheres with the result that the relationship between the two is overlooked. As a consequence, policies that aim to improve the nation's economic and social well-being are also developed in isolation. Yet people on the ground know that a more 'joined-up' approach is needed.The benefit of the LLAKES approach is that we have a team of researchers from across the social sciences who work together, and with stakeholders, to develop the in-depth explanations required to help solve complex problems. One of the ways in which we will foster this collaboration will be by providing opportunities (e.g. workshops and seminars) for the different stakeholders and users to come together to discuss and debate common interests in the light of research evidence. 

The following examples show how we aim to provide practical benefit from our research:

- Providing a robust evidence base for policy-making at a local, regional, national and international level

- Working with practitioners and professionals to translate research evidence into strategies for improving the effectiveness of initiatives, and to inform evaluations

- Contributing to the effectiveness of public services, particularly related to lifelong learning, economic competitiveness and social cohesion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4304425</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What does democracy need from its citizens?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>391216C2-5381-4131-9266-EF86E6502A60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at IEA and European Commission Conference, &amp;quot;Lesson Learned for understanding civic and citizenship education&amp;quot; 2-4 December 2013

The paper outlines a mixed methods study investigating newly qualified nurses' ability to re-contextualise or re-use knowledge learnt in university to allow them to organise, delegate and supervise care on hospital wards in England. The idea of re-contextualisation has been developed by Evans et al (Evans, Guile et al. 2010) using an approach that concentrates on different forms of knowledge and the ways in which these are contextualised and're-contextualised' in movements between different sites of learning.

Integrative approaches to competence, which emphasise the development of capacities are contrasted with those that focus primarily on the performance of work tasks (see Brockmann et al, 2009). In the latter approach many learning outcomes can be achieved through workplace and informal learning and can be validated for accreditation purposes. The European Qualifications Framework describes competence in terms of responsibility and autonomy (EC 2008: 11), emphasising proven knowledge and abilities in work or study situations. EQF is a translation device, allowing equivalences between qualifications to be explored, yet this exploration is critically dependent upon different interpretations of the dominant concepts of competence and qualification in different countries. This paper considers how conceptions of competence and qualification are shaping higher vocational learning in the UK in an occupational field in which transnational recognition has particular importance. Competence development approaches in nursing will be compared with approaches in Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden and UK, with particular reference to the European framework and the part that validation of informal learning plays in this field .

Is public investment in apprenticeships delivering value for money, and what steps might be taken to improve return on investment? Under current funding models, for what types of employers are apprenticeships a worthwhile investment of resources and how might their appeal be widened? What steps could be introduced to address the issues related to subcontracting amongst apprenticeship providers, as highlighted in the recent Ofsted report? Should apprenticeship funding be targeted at particular growth sectors identified by Government, such as renewable energy and the creative industries? Is the current model of shared public and employer investment striking the best balance for financing the apprenticeships system? What is the impact on funding of the new one_year minimum course length for 16_ to 18_year_olds?

The research questions outlined above were discussed in some detail, and the conclusions reached were shared with useful networks.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Organising innovation in Healthcare: the creative practices of everyday bricoleurs&quot;, LLAKES reseach seminar presented by Rebecca Taylor and Susan Halford, 15 December 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>52416503-EFF3-4CEC-BF41-123E9C3CDA78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The seminar was attended by some writers on change in the healthcare sector, who contributed to an extensive discussion following the presentation.

The workshop, which was held at the Paris headquarters of OECD, was aimed at debating different indicators for skills mismatch using data from the OECD'sSurvey of Adult Skills. The OECD's published method had received some notable criticisms, and the Organisation was seeking clarification and wishing to discuss the way forward for future surveys.

Professor Green's presenation reviewed the different biases that can and do arise when measuring skills mismatch from subjective questions in surveys, and suggested that the degree of skills hetrogeneity was so large within major occupational groups that these should not form the basis for the published measure. The Working Group will now review their position in the light of this feedback.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Graduate labour market trends in Germany ', seminar presented by Dr Golo Henseke, Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (BIBB),  Bonn, 17 November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C509263-AD76-46DF-9B7D-D60AD219D846</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Drawing on work at LLAKES and CGHE by Francis Green and Golo Henseke on graduate jobs in Britain and internationally, Golo presented first findings using German job market data.

Our recent study exploring the role and meaning of intermediate level work within the United Kingdom's (UK) healthcare sector sought to make visible the complex and evolving range of responsibilities and levels of expertise of people working in what we came to call the 'intermediate space'. Technological advances have facilitated the standardisation of a range of medical and other health-related tasks, allowing them to be

classified as routine and to be devolved downwards. Thus, healthcare provides a rich terrain for investigating changes and continuities in the education and training, and recognition of intermediate level staff. The research included a mapping of education and career pathways in a range of healthcare occupations and key informant interviews

(professional bodies, employers, employees, trade unions, and education and training providers) in four areas: Maternity Support; Radiography Support; Healthcare Sciences; and Dental Technicians. We argue that contextual factors and traditional binaries based on assumed and longstanding notions of a workforce divided into 'registered' and

'unregistered', 'professional' ('qualified') and 'non' professional grades ('unqualified') and are undermining the development of intermediate posts articulated with clearly defined and well-understood education and training pathways. We suggest that lessons for policy reform can be learned from the example of dental technicians which, as a statutory

registered occupation requiring approved and accredited training, provides a sharp contrast to the other occupational areas.

The JVET conference is an important event in the field of Vocational Education, and was a useful opportunity at which to present LLAKES research in this subject.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Early school leaving: causes, impact, remedies and policy responses</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA2D566B-DCA8-403F-AF3F-39AD2425F905</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The LLAKES Centre joined with the Centre for the Development of Education Policy of the Greek General Confederation of Labour to organise a two-day conference on Early School Leaving; the event was held at the Institute of Education on 27 and 28 June 2014, and was attended by 58 Greek teachers.

This paper discusses early findings from research in three industry sectors in Singapore: creative industries, the Continuing Education and Training (CET) sector and the low wage sector of cleaning services. We are conducting interviews with 30 free-lance or contract-based workers in each sector (90 interview respondents), capturing data about entry into and motivation for contingent work, how work-related networks and relationships are developed and maintained, how roles and movements across roles are negotiated. We are investigating how these workers think and feel their ways into occupational and social identities as they move between different sites of practice. These negotiations and processes do not stand alone; rather they are embedded in wider, 'bigger' sets of relationships that mediate day-to-day work practices. We find that dominant modes of industry engagement; professional, industry and workplace discourses; policy around funding and industrial relations, the degree of industry susceptibility to global financial fluctuations and the organisation and flow of production, along with these workers' own sense of agency, mediate identity formation and learning opportunities

The thirteen LLAKES projects are all developing outputs which will be of use to policy makers and policy-based organisations concerned with economic and societal themes. As specified in the LLAKES 'Pathways to Impact' statement LLAKES project leaders are asked to engage potential end-users, beneficiaries and stakeholders generally early on in the development of their projects and each project is expected to develop a pathways to impact strategy, which is reviewed each year, and which is expected to deliver, in addition to academic impact, significant societal impacts at local, regional, sectoral, national or international levels. LLAKES has maintained close links with BIS/BEIS and DFE and other relevant government departments with which we regularly share research findings and discuss their policy implications. LLAKES also frequently responds to policy consultations launched by these and other departments. We have undertaken collaborative activities with the former UKCES, as well as working with national bodies, such as the TUC, the former NIACE, DELNI and Skills Development Scotland, and international bodies such as OECD and the European Commission. We also engage, where appropriate, with policy think tanks such as Demos and the Intergenerational Foundation. We will continue to work towards generating significant impact from LLAKES research during the remaining period of our ESRC centre grant and afterwards as a Centre without core centre funding. We will be evidencing the impact of LLAKES research in the five impact case studies we have been asked to contribute towards the UCL Institute of Education 2020 REF submission. We give examples impact generation within a number of our projects below. 

LLAKES Research on Free Schools and Private Schools

The LLAKES research on Free Schools has had some impact on the general climate of opinion through extensive media coverage of the research findings. The LLAKES Centre report on &amp;quot;The Social Composition of Free Schools after Three Years&amp;quot; prompted a considerable media response when it was published in August 2014. It was discussed in articles written in The Independent, The Times, The Guardian, and the Times Education Supplement; the story was also covered extensively in specialist publications and in regional and local newspapers; and the lead author, Francis Green, gave interviews to BBC News at Ten, Voice of Russia, Sky News, LBC, Radio 5 Live, Radio London Drivetime, London Live, and BBC London News. The report's findings prompted extensive debate on what is a flagship government policy. A LLAKES research paper entitled: &amp;quot;Can 'dreaming big' help state-educated pupils match private school peers' wages in early middle age?&amp;quot; was press-released in November 2015, and also attracted media interest. 
LLAKES research on private schools is beginning to have an impact. In 2014 Francis Green wrote a piece in The Conversation entitled &amp;quot;Private schools are booming -- but what do you really get for your money?&amp;quot; which received good publicity and readership. This was followed up in November 2015 with a blog from Peter Taylor-Gooby entitled &amp;quot;Who gains from the &amp;quot;public benefit&amp;quot; activities of private schools&amp;quot;? Francis Green addressed a panel at Westminster Education Forum on the topic &amp;quot;The contribution of independent schools to the economy and society&amp;quot;. The audience were almost all practitioners from within education - mainly though not exclusively the private sector. Currently, work is progressing to publicise two further areas of our research on private schools. One concerns their effects on leadership skills, access to the business and financial services sectors, and long-term rewards in the form of high job quality. A LLAKES blog, and simultaneously a blog for the British Educational Research Journal will appear very soon. The other concerns the relationship of private school attendance with marriage to a high-earning partner, and its possible links with low social mobility. A press release has been prepared to coincide with the presentation of this work to the British Sociological Association conference in Manchester in April 2017. The work has attracted the attention of private sector education consultants Hylle Royce. Work is under way to prepare a new book on private schools in Britain, based mainly on this research, written for the general public. This book is scheduled for 2018 publication, and will receive copious publicity. Francis Green also contributed substantially to the collective UCL Institute of Education response to the Green Paper on schools, in December 2016, relating to evidence on private schools. 

LLAKES Research on Adult Skills

The LLAKES Centre's analysis of the data in the OECD Survey of Adult Skills, focusing on adult skills inequality, has had a considerable impact. The initial findings were published in a LLAKES Research Paper in January 2014 ('Why are Literacy and Numeracy Skills in England So Unequal? Evidence from the OECD's Survey of Adult Skills and other International Survey', LLAKES Research Paper 47) with an accompanying Press Release and two blogs by Andy Green ('Class Drives Equality Gap in England's Adult Skills,' The Conversation, 6th February, 2014; 'How Class Continues to Drive the Equality Gap in England's Adult Skills,' IOE Blog, 10th February 2014.) The paper had considerable media impact. There were articles on the research in: the Daily Telegraph ('England among the Worst Nations in the World for its Class Skills Gap', 29.1.2014); Education Journal ('Poor Skills of Millions of Adults Still Held Back by their Parents' Social Class,' 7.2.2014); Wigan Today ('Parents have a Big Influence on Ability,' 7.2.2014, http://www.wigantoday.net/news/education/parents-have-a-big-influence-on-ability-1-6423293). Mentions of the research also occurred in: Mail Online ('Underprivileged Pupils Fall further behind despite Nick Clegg's Flagship Education Policy to Narrow Gap between Rich and Poor Youngsters, 29.1.2014); The Independent ('Children of brainy parents test better'), and The News Matrix (29.1.2014). Francis Green gave an interview on the report for LBC Radio, and Andy Green and Francis Green presented the paper to a special seminar at BIS on 25th February, 2014. 

The research was promoted in two events in 2014. The first of these, held in Dublin, was a conference entitled: 'How to Tackle Intergenerational Equity Gaps in Knowledge and Skills? Ireland in International Context&amp;quot;, and focused on the question of why English-speaking countries - including England, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - perform relatively poorly on international comparisons of adult skills. The symposium allowed senior academics and practitioners from across the UK and Ireland to exchange views and ideas, on subjects including the quality of educational experience; the links between Further and Higher Education; and the role of workplace learning in reducing levels of skills deterioration. The second event was a workshop on the OECD data, which was held at the Institute of Education in June, and was attended by representatives from the National Institute of Adult and Continuing Education, Education and Employers, the University and Colleges Union, and other relevant organisations. Again, this session provided an opportunity for LLAKES members to interpret the OECD findings to a wider audience in ways that allow for the dissemination of information to workplaces and other communities. Andy Green and Nic Pensiero have also been discussing the results with group convened by George Washington University, including Spencer Foundation representatives. 
Follow up journal articles were published in Comparative Education Review in 2015 (featured article: Andy Green, Francis Green and Nicola Pensiero) and British Education Research Journal in 2016 (Andy Green and Nicola Pensiero). These led to invitations for Andy Green and Nicola Pensiero to deliver presentations and keynotes at 17 events internationally, including at the Moscow Higher School of Economics, The Royal Irish Academy, The German Institute for Adult Education (DIE), ASEM Lifelong Learning Hub conferences in Copenhagen, Glasgow and Bali, and at a CNESCO conference in Paris. Andy Green also made an invited presentation at an ATL/PESGB meeting in 2015. 
Aside from the media coverage, specific social impact have been achieved in a number of areas. Andy Green presented oral evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Social Mobility in 2015 with further written submissions based on LLAKES research contributed by Alison Fuller and Lorna Unwin. Their evidence is widely cited in the final report from the Committee, and can claim to have been influential on the findings of the Committee. The other main area of impact has been with the OECD. Andy Green and Francis Green had substantial involvement with the OECD team in the development of the PIAAC, jointly contributing to the initial OECD Skills Strategy document and, in Francis Green's case, contributing to the development of the survey questions. We have shared our results from this Project with them at the second and third of the OECD's International PIAAC Conferences. Francis Green continues to be involved with the development of the PIAAC survey. It would be fair to say that our research has encouraged a stronger focus at OECD on skills gain and its distribution in further and higher education. Francis Green has also published &amp;quot;Skills Demand, Training and Skills Mismatch: A Review of Key Concepts, Theory and Evidence&amp;quot; (2016) as part of the Evidence Review for Go Science and Foresight project: &amp;quot;Future of Skills and Lifelong Learning.&amp;quot; This is one of several pieces of evidence informing this Foresight project which will be presented in due course to ministers and other policy makers in the Department for Education and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Andy Green has coordinated the LLAKES response to the Government consultation on the Building our Industrial Strategy Green paper which focuses on the policies for skills and innovation. 

Research on Young People and transitions

Project 1.1 research on the role of intergenerational factors in learning and well being of young people is also making a substantial academic impact. An international expert seminar on Youth in the Recession took place in June 2014, in which we collaborated with the ESRC project Youth in the Great Recession to bring LLAKES Project 1.1 findings into the wider interdisciplinary exploration of youth experiences in times of economic crisis. Conference papers arising from Project 1.1 were also presented internationally at ASA, AERA, ECER and the Pathways project conference at Marbach Castle, 14-17 November 2014 on Pathways to Adulthood funded by the Jacobs Foundation in 2014. These high profile communication and impact opportunities are contributing to the search for policy solutions. The project has also contributed significantly to a book: Schoon, I. and Eccles, J.S. (eds.) (2014) Gender Differences in Aspirations and Attainment: A Longitudinal Perspective, Cambridge University Press. Ingrid Schoon, one of the project leaders, met Department of Work and Pensions in January 2017 to advise on a forthcoming Green Paper on Social Justice, which will be based in part on research from this project. The project also received widespread press coverage for its findings that &amp;quot;Millennials who chose an apprenticeship over university are just as happy with their lives&amp;quot; which were released in January 2017.
The project 1.4 lead by Claire Callender and Geoff Mason had completed it initial analysis of the survey data collected and its results are beginning to be disseminated in relevant academic and policy communities which are showing considerable interest. A paper based on the findings was presented at an international conference entitled Understanding Student Debt: Who Borrows, The Consequences of Borrowing, and The Implications for Federal Policy Student Debt held at the University of Pennsylvania, August 2016. The conference was sponsored by the Alliance for Higher Education and Democracy, the American Academy of Political and Social Science, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Spencer Foundation and the Wisconsin Center for Advancement of Postsecondary Education (WISCAPE). The presentation aroused considerable interest at the conference and has been accepted for publication published in The Annals. A Paper was also presented to a DFE seminar which formed part of the DFE's 'analysis and evidence learning fortnight'. The audience of 45 were entirely policy makers and internal researchers at DFE. The slides from our presentation and the pre-publication version of our paper have been uploaded onto the DfE intranet which will ensure they have a wider circulation. The Guardian has agreed to publish an article based on the findings of the research. 

LLAKES has also been involved in a number of more generic impact generation exercises. These bring research findings from across the range of LLAKES research to taregetted audiences as part of LLAKES capacity-building endeavours. Two major initiatives have been undertaken in the past year. 

Andy Green led the professional development seminar on &amp;quot;Early School Leaving: Causes, Impact, Remedies and Policy Responses&amp;quot; which was organised in conjunction with the Centre for the Development of Educational Policy of the Greek General Confederation of Labour. Fifty Greek teachers attended the two-day session in June 2014, which included research-based presentations from LLAKES members on the multiple dimensions of early school leaving, including the life trajectories of early leavers, volunteering as a potential route to employment, and responses to the problems in the form of curriculum developments. The teachers were also able to present their own 'front line' experiences of what has been happening in Greek schools during the course of the economic crisis, and to feed their opinions and views into the policy debate.

Francis Green has led a collaboration between the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) and the LLAKES Centre which provides a series of 'Masterclass' sessions for policy-makers. These are based on LLAKES research findings, and are directed specifically at policy and decision makers within government. The Masterclass programme is being delivered at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). Seven presentations have been given so far. These include: 'Employers' Skills Demands' by Francis Green; 'The Historical and Comparative Perspective on the Development of Vocational Education and Training in England', by Andy Green; 'Global Challenges for Higher Education 'by David Finegold; 'Training Trends' by Alan Felstead; 'Apprenticeship and Occupation: Strengthening the Link through the Reform Agenda' by Alison Fuller; 'Competing through Skills' by David Ashton; and 'Youth Transitions' by Karen Evans and Ingrid Schoon. The sequence of presentations has been well attended, and this approach appears to be an effective way of relaying LLAKES research findings directly to influential individuals. It is hoped to continue this series of events despite the recent closure of UKCES.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8590287C-361D-4FC4-B5ED-CF7968DB0479</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Theme One on Youth, Intergenerational Mobility and Civic Values includes four projects. We reported on projects 1.1 and 1.2 last year. Here we provide recent findings from project 1.3, which is lead by Claire Callender and entitled 'Student Debt, Higher Education and Intermediate Skills Development.' Research among prospective UK undergraduates in 2002 found that some students, especially from low social classes, were deterred from applying to university because of fear of debt. This project explores whether this is still the case today in England despite the changing higher education landscape since 2002. Findings from a 2015 survey of prospective undergraduates are compared with those from the 2002 study. We find that students' attitudes to taking on student loan debt are more favourable in 2015 than in 2002. Yet, debt averse attitudes remain much stronger among lower-class students than among upper-class students, and more so than in 2002. However, lower-class students in 2015 did not have stronger debt averse attitudes than did middle-class students. Finally, debt averse attitudes seem more likely to deter planning for higher education among lower-class students compared with students from other social classes, and more so in 2015 than in 2002.
Theme Two on Learning, Work and the Economy includes five projects. We reported on projects 2.4 and 2.5 last year and focus here on the findings from two other projects. Project 2.1 on 'Skills, Innovation and Economic Growth' (lead by Geoff Mason) investigates which kinds of education and skills contribute most to a firm's capacity to absorb knowledge, ideas and technologies generated elsewhere, thus contributing to innovation and productivity growth. Using an industry-level dataset for different branches of manufacturing in the UK, six other European countries and the United States, Project 2.1 has found important roles for both high-level skills and upper intermediate (technician-level) skills in converting opportunities for external knowledge sourcing into innovative outputs (such as new ideas for products and processes). When it comes to combining innovations with other inputs into the production of final goods and services, productivity growth is enhanced not just by high-level skills and upper intermediate skills but also by the skills of other sections of the workforce, including those with uncertified skills (for example, skills acquired through informal on-the-job training and work experience). Project 2.2 on Inter-Professional Learning in the Creative and Cultural Sector (lead by David Guile) has created a new practice-based theoretical perspective by establishing a link between working, learning and innovating in interprofessional project teams. This perspective opens-up the well-known black box of 'absorptive capacity' by identifying the un-codified project-team-generated practices which facilitate project teams and their clients to work together to innovate. This perspective also offers another angle on what is often referred to in the Economics of Innovation literature as 'intangible' outcomes. The project identifies some of the co-working and learning practice which are responsible for generating intangible outcomes.
Theme Three on Education, Inequality and Social Cohesion includes four projects. Projects 1 and 4 were completed last year and we focus here on the new findings from two other projects. Project 3.2 (lead by Lucinda Platt) analyses longitudinal data from several English-speaking countries to ascertain the determinants of early childhood cognitive outcomes. Using an initial case study of patterns of breast-feeding, a behaviour that is critical for a range of child outcomes, it shows that the large country-level differences in these outcomes cannot be explained through composition, which points to the role of both policy and 'culture.' Consequently, it continues by investigating differences in early years childcare / early education and how far these early experiences are linked to persistent differences in outcomes. Motivated by the policy of the UK Government calling on schools to promote fundamental British values (FBVs), Project 3.3 on 'Lifelong Learning Systems, Equality and Civic Values' analyses support for FBVs among a cohort of 23 year olds in England. Using data from the Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS), including from Wave 6 conducted by LLAKES, it finds that levels of support for FBVs are already very high, questioning the necessity of the policy. Among the educational predictors, educational attainment and track attended (academic or vocational) appear to have a much greater influence on FBVs than specific programmes or pedagogies experienced during lower secondary school, such as citizenship education, an open climate of classroom discussion or school-based political activities. This difference could be due to the possibility that the effect of education on FBVs is mainly positional.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from Project 1.2 will be of interest and value to policymakers and NGOs that are interested in youth civic engagement and youth opportunities in education, employment and housing. NGOs such as the Citizenship Foundation are already using some of the original data we have collected to highlight the opportunities and challenges young people experience when trying to engage in civic and political activities. With the Young Advisors charity, we have been getting young people involved in the research process. To this end, YA youth workers conducted interviews in their communities, giving us a 'youth' perspective on our topic guide, and contributing to our analyses. We hope that this process will also help the Young Advisors charity to build capacity in working with academic institutions. A launch of the full results from the CELS survey was organised in the Houses of Parliament in 2015 and we have produced a policy briefing on the findings. LLAKES has organised two international conferences on research on young people and the crisis in 2015 and 2016 and intergenerational equity will be a major theme of LLAKES' major international conference in May 2018. We have also shared our work with the Intergenerational Foundation and the Resolution Foundation who we hope will also be represented at this conference. The findings from the research have also been disseminated through LLAKES blogs on housing (Andy Green) and young people and voting (Germ Janmaat) and through Germ Janmaat's piece in The Conversation on young people, education and tolerance. Andy Green's book on The Crisis for Young People: Generational Inequalities in Education, Work, Housing and Welfare will be published in the Spring of 2017, and he will be presenting the book's proposed policies for intergenerational equity in a keynote at a conference organized by the Institute of Social Sciences &amp;amp; Humanities (IAKE) in Heraklion in May. As the full results from our research appear we would expect to have important findings with relevance to DFE and the Home Office and will seek engagement policy-makers in relevant sections of these departments. 

The results from research from Project 3.1 have been widely disseminated in the academic community globally. Andy Green and Nic Pensiero have given 17 invited presentations and keynotes on the research, including at the Moscow Higher School of Economics, The Royal Irish Academy, The German Institute for Adult Education (DIE), ASEM Lifelong Learning Hub conferences in Copenhagen, Glasgow and Bali, and at a CNESCO conference in Paris. The results have been discussed with policy makers in several countries. An invited presentation to BIS was made (with Francis Green) in 2014 and Andy Green presented the evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Social Mobility in 2015. We had substantial involvement with the OECD team with the development of the PIAAC and have shared our results from this Project with them at the second and third of the OECD's International PIAAC Conferences. Francis Green continues to be involved with the development of the PIAAC survey. An invited presentation was also made to an ATL/PESGB meeting in 2015. The main policy implications for England arising from our results is the importance of the upper secondary phase of education and training for reducing skills inequality and the need to achieve higher rates of completion in long-cycle programmes at this level which include sustained development of Maths and English language skills. We will want to discuss our findings with DFE policy-makers and develop further research to assess the effectiveness of new measures for raising leaving ages and making English and Maths a required part of further education courses.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E6F9DBC5-9175-4F6A-BCAC-58229E12924C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.llakes.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Does apprenticeship work for adults?</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1DE15565-FF48-4185-8575-52F52014564F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Alison Fuller and Professor Lorna Unwin combined work drawn from LLAKES Centre research with a project funded by the Nuffield Foundation to compile a report and present a seminar on the status of Adult Apprenticeships in the UK.

As the government aims to meet its target for 3 million apprentices, the research finds that current funding is being used to support the training of existing employees who are badged as apprentices. The study, 'Does apprenticeship work for adults?' examined the experiences of adult apprentices aged 25 and over in five different sectors and the motivations of their employers for participating in the government-funded programme. It identified considerable demand for upskilling and retraining from employees aged over 25 and over. It also found that employers are keen to adopt 'grown your own' training strategies to develop the specific skills they need and to help with staff retention. But, many of the apprentices had not received the level of training associated with an apprenticeship. The research team found that older learners voiced concerns about the lack of new learning and whether the qualifications they gained will help them progress in their careers. Adult apprentices were more positive about having to pass English and Maths tests, which many found challenging and rewarding, and many welcomed the chance to improve their IT skills. 

The study called for a radical rethink of the way government uses the term 'apprenticeship' to avoid it becoming devalued. In the light of a rapidly ageing population and the removal of mandatory retirement, it also called for specific strategies to support the upskilling and retraining of older workers. The danger of current cuts to the skills budget is that many adults who could benefit from training will miss out.

Lorna Unwin and Alison Fuller are disseminating their findings widely, and have links to senior members of the government, so it is anticipated that these findings, in an area of critical importance, will have policy implications.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in European Commission, country report for UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>796C80F7-F507-4A03-979F-C5D64EDFF697</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 2016 EC country report for the United Kingdom which carried a citation for paper written by Professor Lorna Unwin and Professor Alison Fuller, apprenticeship and occupation, which was based in part on LLAKES research and was published by the Gatsby Foundation.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/cr2016_uk_en.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Making Apprenticeships Work for Young Women</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC0EA6F3-A1E7-49CA-908D-6AAFAB0B210C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016, Young Women's Trust launched an important report on the issue of young women and apprenticeships.

He notes that this relationship varies across countries and classrooms. In environments with many first generation migrant children (those born abroad), diversity is not having much of an effect. By contrast, in classrooms with many second-generation migrant students (children whose parents were born abroad) diversity enhances inclusive attitudes. 

Better contact between 'native' and 'second generation' students is likely to explain this difference. Second generation students are more familiar with the receiving country's culture and customs and have a better command of its language. They also have more friendships with native students. These conditions make meaningful cross-cultural contact possible, which, in turn, should raise native students' feelings of sympathy with immigrants.

At a time when political parties across Europe are responding to widespread public concern about immigration, this research suggests there could be a more harmonious future. It was suggested that once immigrant communities have become more settled and integrated in the destination countries, positive effects of ethnic mixing could well emerge everywhere. Diverse classrooms could play a key role in fostering this change.

Janmaat further found that classroom ethnic mix works best at medium and higher levels of diversity. He concluded that policy makers should consider ethnic mixing as a strategy to promote more inclusive out-group attitudes among the native majority. They should not expect immediate results, however, in schools with many first-generation students. Neither should they expect a minimal presence of immigrant students in class to do the job.

The study analysed survey data from the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS) which were collected in 2009 among more than 100,000 13 and 14-year-olds in 38 countries worldwide. The analyses included controls for many student and classroom characteristics. The study has recently been published online in the leading sociology journal European Sociological Review.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Andy Green - evidence for House of Lords Committee on Social Inequality, 22 July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DBDCB3A9-22AB-4EF4-8F74-9BC7FA0FD8C1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Andy Green's evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Social Inequality drew on data derived from LLAKES research, and published as a briefing paper entitled: &amp;quot;The Effects of Upper Secondary Education and Training Systems on Skills Inequality&amp;quot;.

Responses included the following:

Tristram Hunt MP, Labour's Shadow Education Secretary: David Cameron is damaging our education system with his free school programme, taking standards backwards. By allowing unqualified teachers into the classroom and presiding over a widening of the attainment gap between the poorest children and the rest, we are seeing school standards suffer under this Tory-led Government. Labour will put an end to this damaging policy by introducing new local Directors of School Standards to raise standards for all children in all schools.
 
Chris Keates, General Secretary of the NASUWT: The findings of this Report come as no surprise. The Institute of Education is not the first organisation to draw attention to these concerns. For example, this report echoes many of the findings of the Academies Commission. It highlights issues that the NASUWT predicted would occur when the current academies and free schools programme was conceived by the Coalition. There has never been any evidence that structural change raises standards, but there is a wealth of evidence to show that it can lead to social segregation. The NASUWT warned that the ability of free schools and academies to police their own admissions would create opportunities for selection to flourish, and it is clear from this report that this is exactly what is happening. Millions of pounds of taxpayers' money is being poured into a handful of free schools. Most of these qualified for the funding on the basis they were being established in deprived areas. Yet they appear to have no real desire to serve those communities and are instead using their freedoms to exclude those local children who need the most help. Our children and young people deserve better.
 
Kevin Courtney, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers: The findings of the Institute of Education report echo what the NUT has warned for many years. Even if free schools do open in disadvantaged areas, there is growing evidence that intake will be discriminatory. Today's findings by the IoE are similar to those of the National Audit Office, who recently found that just 16% of pupils at 81 free schools were eligible for free school meals, compared to 25% in neighbouring schools. Free schools are not serving their communities to anything like the same extent. Like-for-like comparisons of school achievement become less reliable as a result. 
Free schools are not raising standards, however, despite Government claims. Around half of pupils in free schools (46%) inspected by Ofsted are in schools which 'require improvement' or are judged 'inadequate'. You will also struggle to find a state maintained school judged 'dysfunctional' by Ofsted, yet this was the word used to describe a free school last year. Nor are they targeting areas of greatest need. The school places crisis continues to grow, with local authorities powerless to open new schools. This right must be restored to local authorities, who are far better placed to organise provision. Tackling the school places crisis should be one of Nicky Morgan's highest priorities. The increasing number of free schools that are being set up by large academy chains and existing trusts also gives the lie to the idea that the free school programme is driven by parental demand. What is being offered to parents is an untested experiment with children's futures.&amp;quot;
 
Martin Freedman, director of economic strategy and negotiations at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL): Free schools have brought in selection by the back door and become the elite institutions we feared they would be, dominated by children with the pushiest parents. This report shows that even where free schools have opened in deprived areas they are still not taking the most disadvantaged children. This blows out one of the government's main rationales for free schools - that they would help poorer children. And even worse, the government is depriving other schools and their pupils of large amounts of money to fund the opening of free schools. How much longer can the government try to justify pouring money into an educational experiment that is clearly not working?</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/aug/07/free-schools-popular-non-white-families-report</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submission to Teaching Excellence Framework: Technical Consultation for Year Two</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5EDA06BF-94E9-449E-82CD-4735C6916242</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Self-Evaluations, Aspirations, High-Valued Social Networks, and the Private School Earnings Premium</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32AA5749-2385-4248-B8E6-CB30341BA5B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Francis Green led the derivation of a press-released research paper on the impact on incomes of private education in the UK. The research showed that raising state school children's aspirations, self-confidence, and improving their access to social networks would do little to counter the huge pay advantages enjoyed by their privately-educated peers.

Better education, superior academic performance and entry to higher-ranking universities are the main reasons why private school males go on to earn, at age 42, 34 per cent more than their state school peers. Women who attended fee-paying schools earn 21 per cent more, on average, than their state school counterparts by this age. These educational advantages account for the entire private school pay premium for women, and around half of that for men.

Strategies to raise self-esteem, self-confidence and aspirations in the state school sector are unlikely to be very effective in narrowing the pay gap between the private and state sectors in later life. Such policies might seem attractive because they do not have to address the large differences in resources between the sectors.

The results suggested that social equality strategies should continue to focus on the considerable educational disadvantages of state school pupils relative to their privately-educated peers. The source of private schools' advantage remains primarily their ability to deliver better academic performance. Policies should therefore remain focused on narrowing the gaps in educational achievement between private and state schools.

The project investigated the fact that a number of 'Youth Labour Markets' now exist in the UK, each providing very different opportunities for an expanding age group of 18-30 year olds. In addition, there are an increasing number of different ways of 'getting in' to work for young people, such as apprenticeships, voluntary work placements, enterprise schemes and so on, across the public, private and voluntary sectors. Different
regions within the UK have institute d various strategies for local economic growth and regeneration which often include schemes to help young people access new skills and get into work. However, little is known about the success of these schemes and how young people's experiences of getting into work and getting on within their careers varies across the different regions of the UK. 

The project findings show a significant demand from young people for the training and qualifications provided by centres such as Volunteer Glasgow to support their work and career aspirations. Many of the respondents believe they have the ability to make a productive contribution to the economic life of the city, given the opportunity and the right environment. Although perhaps lacking in those skills deemed to be essential for economic remuneration, they are motivated to gain the relevant training and experience in order that these may be obtained. However it also clear that a 'one size fits all' approach to developing young people's employability skills is not appropriate, given the diversity of their educational, social and health backgrounds. This is where the real strengths of the programmes offered by centres such as Volunteer Glasgow most clearly reveal themselves. The findings show that these are perceived to offer substantial benefits across the full range of course members. Most highly valued are the individualistic and caring approach of the staff, the sensitively designed curriculum of both classroom tasks and the opportunity for real workplace experience. However, for the programme to be fully successful, it is also important that organizations offering volunteering experience fully recognize their responsibility towards the training and employment of young people.
