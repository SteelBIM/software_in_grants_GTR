This representation is not fixed, but is continuously updated in response to the available sensory information. While previous studies have highlighted the role of vision, touch and proprioception in constructing the body-representation in the brain, the role of auditory information remains largely unknown. Interestingly, the sounds that accompany almost every bodily movement are highly rich in information about the body and the space immediately surrounding it. For instance, the sounds produced when tapping on a surface inform us about the length and strength of our arm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will investigate how auditory information generated by our bodies updates our body-representation. A series of psychological experiments will explore how altering self-produced sounds in real-time changes different body-representations, including the representation of the space surrounding the body, the potential actions that we can perform and the emotional states linked to our body capabilities. This multidisciplinary and innovative research project will provide novel insights into the nature of body-representations and, ultimately, guide the design of audio-based applications that can improve body-image, self-esteem, movement patterns and social interactions to support wellbeing and rehabilitation for people with movement impairments. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research has potential to contribute to the nation's wealth and health because it will propose how we can use sound-based technologies, for inducing changes in body-representation (BR), that increase awareness of action possibilities and trigger specific emotional states:

(i) At the business/industrial level the project will impact health and wellbeing information and communications technology applications, by establishing links with designers of sensory-augmentation systems for entertainment, rehabilitation, behavioural change and fitness, as well as Virtual Reality (VR). The project will benefit the commercial private sector by setting the basis for designing sound-based applications that promote healthier life style by improving people's self-image, self-esteem, self-efficacy, action patterns and social interaction. This may attract the interest of companies such as Microsoft, Apple, Fujitsu, Orange or Boots. The extensive use of headphones and wearable devices (e.g. Apple iPod) and the increasing market for motion-sensing input devices (e.g. Microsoft Kinect) in society today, provide an excellent potential for consumer applications. The links with these sectors will be initiated during the project and the impact may be quickly realised in full, contributing to the nation's economic performance.

(ii) A number of general public user groups could benefit from the potential sound-based applications, that may enhance the quality of life, health and wellbeing:
 a) populations with clinical disorders linked to distortion of BR. Certain types of chronic pain, affecting nearly one in seven UK citizens, are accompanied by an alteration of BR, perceived motor capabilities and emotional distress [33] (e.g. complex regional pain syndrome-CRPS, phantom limb pain, fibromyalgia, focal dystonia). These conditions adversely affect psychological wellbeing and social and working life. Similar clinical disorders linked to distortions of BR are anosognosia for hemiplegia8 and anorexia nervosa [9].
 b) the general population. Every year near 40,000 UK citizens undergo plastic surgery procedures that change their bodily appearance [38]. The fitness industry is also growing exponentially, which reflects general appearance/body-related concerns. Young people's body and self-esteem may be closely linked to their emotional and physical wellbeing. Older people are often concerned about what their body can do, to the detriment of their motor performance and emotional states [39]. Induced changes in BR may lead to improved self-esteem as a result of feeling good about one's body and may promote healthy behaviour and social interaction, which are central for enhancing the wellbeing of the general population.

I will undertake a series of activities during the project lifetime to engage with these populations, the organizations supporting the clinical cohorts (e.g. the NHS) and the industries developing interactive technology for therapy. The aim will be to examine the potential benefits of the research and to inform and shape the design of new technology for wellbeing, rehabilitation and entertainment. This can contribute to fostering the nation's health and wellbeing in the short-term. The project will open discussion on the potential benefits for the clinical groups by focusing on CRPS patients, who have a particularly altered BR (e.g. an affected limb may be perceived as larger than it actually is [36]). Part of the discussion will aim to identify other potential beneficiaries.

The project will impact on my research and professional skills and will consolidate my career and development into a future research leader, by providing me with a solid research base, project management and teaching/supervision skills, as well as strong links with other researchers, technology designers and users. Similar skill development opportunities will be given to any junior staff directly associated with this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>169625</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Humboldt University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Fellow of the Einstein Research Group: &amp;quot;Consciousness, Emotions, Values&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D26AD76-2120-47D3-84A1-95E508657AAC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary collaboration involving Philosophy, Art and Experimental Psychology disciplines

This research has lead to a number of academic findings that we have disseminated through research publications and presentations at public events.

At the business/industrial level the project has attracted the interest of companies working on information and communication technology applications, as detailed below:
? We have discussed our research approach and findings with companies such as Microsoft, BBC, the Human Factors and Devices Research Team of Hyundai Motor Company or FADA-CATEC (Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies). 
? We have conducted research in collaboration with the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT) in Japan, to investigate the use of sound technologies to alter BR. This collaboration has already materialized in terms of academic outputs (i.e., journal articles), and has also the potential to impact on communications technology applications. 
? We have established links with designers of sensory augmentation systems for entertainment and health. During the life-time of the project we built connections with virtual reality (VR) researchers through attending the UCL VR club and London VR Seminars and through presenting findings from the project at the 1st London Virtual Social Interaction Workshop, as well as through collaborations with Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics and University of Barcelona. With the latter, we used VR technology to induce in older people the feelings of having a younger body. This research has led to an academic publication (in preparation), and has also the potential to impact on the well-being of older people, who are often concerned about their body appearance and what their body can do, to the detriment of their motor performance and emotional states.
? One of the project outcomes is that sound-based technologies altering BR can be used to enhance motor behaviour, such as gait, and enhance emotional state. This work, which may feed into the fitness industry, set the bases for a new grant we have received (running through 2016-2019) and which will investigate how to change sedentary lifestyles by altering BR using sensory feedback. We are currently securing collaboration with a company to integrate sensing technology in shoes and use those to alter people's BR. 

The above-mentioned work has the potential to make a socio-economical impact on medical and social practices. It is expected that the impact on healthy groups and others with specific BR disruptions will be fully realized when new therapies and self-management technologies relying on alterations of BR, that incorporate the outputs of the project, become available to these groups. During the life-time of the project we have built connections with NHS and the team at Stanmore Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital (RNOH) and started a collaboration with them to investigate the potential use of the technologies designed in the project in therapies and self-management of people with chronic pain for treatment of body-perception distortions linked to pain. This collaboration has materialized in a journal article (under review) and has set the bases for further collaborative work within the medical sector. 

The wider impact on general audiences outside scientific sectors came through participation in public and educational events, knowledge of transfer events and events with potential users in medical contexts. Public events have included showcasing our paradigms and results at the 2013 BNA Festival of Neuroscience, at the 2015 &amp;quot;Being Human&amp;quot; Festival, at the Wellcome collection (&amp;quot;Wrong&amp;quot; event in 2013 and &amp;quot;In Pursuit of Pain&amp;quot; event in 2016) and at the London Science Museum (&amp;quot;You have been upgraded&amp;quot; festival on Human Enhancement and the &amp;quot;Wearable 'superpowers'&amp;quot; event, both in 2015). Educational events have included a public display of demos on the theme &amp;quot;Our Bodies and Technology&amp;quot; for the Royal Institution &amp;amp; UCL Masterclass HCI for 9th grade school students. Knowledge transfer activitites with art and cultural community have included providing scientific advice to creative teams working on the multisensory representation of pain at the Barbican Centre or working on an immersive theatrical art exhibition on neuroscience and perception (project led by David Byrne), and participation in one of the discussion panels of &amp;quot;The Lab Project&amp;quot; organized by Camden Arts Centre and supported by the Centre and Kingsgate Workshops Trust. Events with potential users in medical contexts have included organization of the event &amp;quot;Putting people at the centre of digital health&amp;quot; at the 2014 UCL Festival for Digital Health, and active participation at the 2015 event on Designing apps organized by the UCL Institute of Health Informatics. The research on this project has been featured in a series of journals and magazines such as New Scientist, Daily Mail or The Telegraph, as well as National and International Radio Programmes (BBC Radio 4, US Radio Caracol, German WPK, Danish Broadcasting Corporation) and TV Programmes (Spanish Television TVE2).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F549DDB5-FB1F-4ADF-8A50-E4DBDCA01A46</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>? Mental body-representations can be altered via sound: New knowledge/methodology
Using innovative virtual 3D-audio and gesture-sound interactive systems in our experiments we showed that real-time alterations of the sound generated by bodily actions can change how people mentally represent their own body. We found that (i) increasing the distance from which one hears the sounds produced by his/her hand tapping on a surface leads to perceive one's arm as being longer (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015a); (ii) altering one's footstep sounds as if produced by either a lighter body leads to changes in one's represented body size (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015b). We also demonstrated that for updates to happen: (i) the sound-feedback needs to be felt as being generated by one's body and (ii) spatiotemporal sound alterations need to be kept under certain limits (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015a; 2015c). Our studies showed for the first time that the alteration of body-representation is possible through sound-feedback, and not just through other sensory inputs, and that it follows the principles observed for visually-driven alterations. This has important theoretical implications as it suggests that body-representation is supramodal. It also has implications for real-word applications as sound-driven alterations in body-representation are more easily applied in ubiquitous settings than visual-driven ones. 

? Development of a Body-Emotion-Action model to study body-representation and object interactions
Through our findings we showed an interaction between body-representation, emotional state and motor behaviour. We found that (i) altering the spatial cues of the sounds produced when tapping a surface with one's hand changes the subsequent arm movements to reach an object, as well as the perceived tactile distances on the tapping arm (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015a; submitted); (ii) altering cues related to the strength applied when tapping a surface changes one's tapping behavior and emotional state (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015c); (iii) altering walking sound cues related to body weight changes one's gait and emotional state (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2015b). Our studies are first to propose a framework to jointly study body-representation, emotion and action by using multiple stimuli and measures. Of significance, we found similar principles apply to object perception during body-objects interactions: real-time manipulation of the sounds generated when touching a surface changes the perceived material properties, such as texture or hardness, and this in turn changes the touch behavior and the emotional feelings elicited by this interaction (Tajadura-Jim&amp;eacute;nez/2014; 2015c).

? New Collaborations
This award led to initiate academic collaborations across countries (France, Spain, Japan) and disciplines (with the Centre for the Study of the Senses (Philosophy); IRCAM (Acoustics/Music research); Universidad de Barcelona (Psychology/Computer Science/Virtual Reality)). Further, projects linked to this award are currently ongoing in clinical sites (Stanmore Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital) and industrial sites (NTT-Japan). Our work was chosen by artist David Byrne for a public immersive theatrical 'science exhibition'.

? Training delivered in specialist skills
This award contributed to two PhD theses by directing to complement HCI approaches with an embodied understanding of sound for health technology solutions (Newbold/2016; Singh/2014; 2016). Various undergraduate/MSc students received training; one got the best MSc thesis award (2014) and her work led to publish in the best conference in HCI (20% acceptance rate).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The innovative methodological approach combining interactive multimodal-tracking and sound-feedback technologies, and the new understanding of sound manipulations affecting body-representations, have led to novel ways of investigating further the above questions by including a modality usually left out (e.g. in VR, in collaboration with Barcelona University; also in contact with industry wishing to add realism to VR). Further, HCI, computer scientists and clinical psychologists are now investigating how sound-based wearable devices could be used to develop technology-based interventions for health. For example, Bianchi-Berthouze and Cohen are investigating their use in therapies and self-management of people with chronic pain. Based on the award outcomes, we have taken a first step towards clinical interventions through a collaborative project with Stanmore Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. We are testing our 'sonic shoes', which alter people's body-representation, gait and emotion, for treatment of body-perception distortions linked to pain. We expect that technologies and therapies integrating the award outcomes may be used to aid normalisation of distorted body-representations, for instance due to pain, limb amputation or anorexia nervosa, and also address increasing concerns on bodily appearance in the general population. Ultimately, these technologies may aid movement and enhance emotional states and well-being, thus making a socio-economic impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0A465C55-6328-434C-875C-70E5452FCFE7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic/research/project-pages/hearing-body</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/31290375-60BB-4238-8714-27243503EEF0"><gtr:id>31290375-60BB-4238-8714-27243503EEF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Action Sounds Modulate Arm Reaching Movements.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/135729b98dbb2f28a2ae39aed5db5d39"><gtr:id>135729b98dbb2f28a2ae39aed5db5d39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tajadura-Jim?nez A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-1078</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4E831149-8F2F-4E3A-AEF9-9D07F14135B1"><gtr:id>4E831149-8F2F-4E3A-AEF9-9D07F14135B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>It's not just what we touch but also how we touch it</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/15b1c8945a972b6a65c5b0b8e7edd259"><gtr:id>15b1c8945a972b6a65c5b0b8e7edd259</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bianchi-Berthouze, N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B8700C37-8B51-4ACF-A67B-88E75D60E392"><gtr:id>B8700C37-8B51-4ACF-A67B-88E75D60E392</gtr:id><gtr:title>Go-with-the-Flow: Tracking, Analysis and Sonification of Movement and Breathing to Build Confidence in Activity Despite Chronic Pain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Human-Computer Interaction</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/62669b53e98481724294af0f7a2ae396"><gtr:id>62669b53e98481724294af0f7a2ae396</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Singh A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC680933-3289-4AB8-B0F0-BB437FE384C8"><gtr:id>CC680933-3289-4AB8-B0F0-BB437FE384C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sonification for Chronic Pain Rehabilitation: Facilitating Progress &amp;amp;
