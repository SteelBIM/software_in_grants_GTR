It aims to study the Sun and its effects on the heliosphere. This region of space, in which all the planets reside, is occupied by the solar wind, an ionised gas, or plasma, streaming away from the Sun at speeds of many 100s km/s. Although the solar wind is not very dense (a few particles per cubic centimeter), these high speeds mean that the energy density is high enough to be significant when coupling occurs between this out-flowing plasma and the magnetic fields of planets. This is particularly true, for example, when the Sun releases a coronal mass ejection (CME), which, if they intercept the Earth, are known to cause Magnetic Storms. Although we have been able to measure the solar wind and its effects in near-Earth space for some time, there remain many questions as to the origin of the solar wind, the variability within it and in particular how these relate to features and dynamic activity on the solar surface. This link remains unclear due to difficulty in unambiguously connecting solar wind streams, or events such as CMEs, to particular features in the solar corona. Even when this can be done, evolution occurs in the solar wind during the few days it takes to propagate from the Sun, so the underlying signatures of the coronal source regions have been 'washed out' of the solar wind observed at Earth orbit. The only way to make the link is to make measurements close to the Sun, in solar wind which has yet to suffer the effects of propagation. In addition, the Sun and the solar wind plasma is highly variable. In order to study this variability, we must ensure that we do not confuse it with effects of changing location, so we need to make measurements as best we can, for as long as we can, over the same point on the solar surface. SO aims to achieve both these goals, in that it will travel into as close as 0.22 AU from the Sun (1 AU is the distance from Sun to the Earth), and will also enter an orbit in which at times it closely co-rotates with the Sun. It will carry an instrument package that makes both 'remote sensing' of the solar surface and 'in situ' measurements of the solar wind at the spacecraft itself. UCL/MSSL is the Principal Investigator institution on the proposal for the Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) package submitted to ESA, and is leading an international consortium to provide the required elements of this instrument package, which are: - The Electron Analyser System (EAS) will make key high time resolution measurements of the electron populations in the solar wind, which provide a key diagnostic of the magnetic connectivity between the spacecraft and the Sun. The EAS will be built at UCL/MSSL, with technical contributions from CESR in Toulouse. - The Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS) will measure the major ion species in the solar wind. This will be built by Southwest Research Institute and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the USA. - The Heavy Ion Sensor (HIS) will measure the fluxes of some prominent minor species in the solar wind. The HIS will be built by the University of Michigan, University of New Hampshire and CESR Toulouse. - A suite data processing unit (DPU) will be provided by IFSI, Rome. These instruments are optimized for the Solar Orbiter science objectives. In particular, SWA is critical to underpinning the unique ability of Solar Orbiter to make the direct link between the remotely-sensed observations on the Sun with the phenomena observed in the inner heliosphere. The SWA data, together with the other in situ and remote sensing instruments, will provide the best and most direct constraints for the physical processes that control the properties of the corona, and its connections into space. The work here allows MSSL to complete the Cosmic Vision definition phase and supports related instrument studies</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>61249</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Southwest Research Institute (SWRI) San Antonio</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Space Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>SWA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6FEF6DB-D60D-40E7-A343-E296378868A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are now in the build phase of the project.

Many hundreds of consortium documents have been generated over this time.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We are directly collaborating with LPP on the provision of an electron analyser system (EAS) for Solar Orbiter. We will contribute an FPGA to the Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS), the design and build of which is the responsibility of the French IRAP team. the czech group will also contribute to PAS. IRAP will collaborate with the US groups on the design and build of the Heavy ion sensor (HIS).</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We (UCL/MSSL) are the Principle Investigator Institution for the Solar Orbiter SWA (Solar Wind Analyser) suite of instruments, with responsibility for leading and managing the whole of the international consortium.
