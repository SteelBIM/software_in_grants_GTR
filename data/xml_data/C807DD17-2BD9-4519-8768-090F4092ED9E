It will augment existing building systems with additional low-cost sensors, and use information processing approaches to make sense of this data, and to detect novel and unusual patterns within this data. It will communicate interventions to the users of the building through intuitive and engaging display techniques and actuators (eg a mobile phone sends a 'shiver' to an employee passing an open window that should be closed). These interventions will initially be informed by a systematic data gathering process including a review of published evidence and use of current models. From this we will identify key energy saving opportunities and challenges within the trial building, and capture the perspectives, values and drivers of users' energy saving choices.The project will seek to develop fundamental and generalisable approaches to monitoring and sensing building use and energy consumption. It will demonstrate them within the context of the industrial setting provided by Federal-Mogul. It will make use of the innovative user-centred interventions developed by Vitamins and the Universities of Dundee and Southampton, which are in turn informed by a systematic data gathering process including a review of published evidence and use of current models performed by Arup and University College London. It will interface with the sensing and interaction hardware developed by Moixa Energy and More Assoicates. The research to be carried out by the University of Leeds is summarised below:Research into effective modes of engagement for behaviour change / utilising expertise to inform the design process:The research process will, in the first instance, include site visits to observe the flow of human movement and the movement styles /patterns of the site occupants. Information will be gathered regarding the site-users' relationship to the existing site in relation to their expectations, hopes and aspirations for the future predicted site as a means for developing person-centred information and subjective responses which will inform the development of the new site's interactive 'conversational' content. This research information and data will then feed into the development of site-user focus group sessions, the results of which will then feed into the development of the design process. As the project develops, the research process will incorporate a process of observing and exploring the site-users' exploration and usage of the emerging 'conversational tools' informed by observation and analysis of the site-users' engagement with the solutions and prototypes informed by theories and expert knowledge of of spatial awareness and kinaesthetic empathy. The intention is to develop very quickly a large number of ideas from lots of angles, and that these would be concurrently 'tested out' with the people in the building through description, conversation, and hacking very quick mock ups of the proposals (undertaken by Moixa / Vitamins - / Leeds / Arup), resulting in a shortlist of tested communications that will be effective in prompting behaviour change, and that represent an innovative and fresh approach. Towards the end of the project,the research will focus on the evaluation of the process and the preparation of an academic paper / conference presentation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>12663</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Architects of the Invisible' was a performance project that investigated a series of visual, conceptual and organisational provocations centred around collective creativity, process-oriented methodologies and social interaction. The main focus of the company production was to explore ways that 17 individuals could construct and deconstruct their social environments through the use of non-linear strategies to generate and articulate ideas. It developed as a spin-off idea from engagement with literatures addressing ways that people behave in social, hierarchic groups with identified roles and responsibilities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3F3E3AB-B76C-4265-B757-483172C003D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.'Architects of the Invisible' was performed for public audiences over four days in the stage@leeds complex at the University of Leeds. The work was seen by over 200 people with positive responses in terms of he complexity and challenges that the performers explored.
