From their rapid radiation over 550 million years ago, they evolved to fill almost every habitat and exploit most imaginable lifestyles. Today, arthropods underpin virtually all ecological communities and food webs. They are of immense economic and medical importance to humans: as sources of food, crop pests and vectors of disease. 

In order to understand the biodiversity of arthropods, to investigate the mechanisms by which they evolved, and to plan for their conservation, it is vitally important that we have a clear picture of their evolutionary relationships. There are many thousands of published evolutionary trees for particular arthropod groups at a shallow level (e.g., species within families) as well as many that attempt to resolve the more ancient branching events. These published trees represent an enormously rich resource, but one that largely remains locked within the pages of journals. This project will digitise 5,000 or more trees from across the arthropods, and make them available to all researchers electronically online. 

Unfortunately, there are serious difficulties when researchers try to compare published trees: partly because they are derived from many different types of data (anatomy, molecules, genomes and fossils) and partly because they are analysed in an even greater variety of ways. More problematically, they often imply contradictory patterns of evolution. How, then, can we bring all of this information together to yield the giant, all-inclusive trees that evolutionary biologists and conservationists need, and do so without cherry-picking the data? Supertree methods are presently the most tractable approach, resolving conflict and finding overlap between the source trees using objective and repeatable rules. Such approaches have yielded the largest trees ever published. 

Unfortunately, again, the construction of supertrees is presently very time-consuming and labour-intensive. Moreover, once constructed, it is extremely difficult or impossible to add new trees, to sub-sample the data (e.g., molecules or morphology), or to generate supertrees using different methods. Another core objective of this project is therefore to develop a set of software tools that will largely automate the process, providing inexperienced users with the ability to construct a supertree for any arthropod group at any taxonomic level (e.g., species, genera, families, etc.), and using multiple filtering criteria (e.g., only the most robust or recent source trees). We will then embed these tools in the website containing our data. 

Existing, fast supertree methods are not without their problems, and another key objective of the project will therefore be to realise and program novel approaches (new Quartet Joining, Maximum Likelihood, Conservative and Bayesian methods are all under development by members of the team and our collaborators). The properties of these new methods need characterisation, and our arthropod dataset will offer the perfect test case against which to benchmark their performance. 

We will then use our supertrees to ask a range of important questions in the study of arthropod biodiversity. Which evolutionary relationships are well-understood, and which are most uncertain and in need of further research? Which arthropod groups have an evolutionary branching sequence that matches the order in which they appear as fossils (such groups are useful for calibrating 'molecular clocks')? Is there a relationship between the age of arthropod groups and their present day diversity? We will also explore the utility of supertrees for addressing conservation priorities. Species that are alone on isolated branches of the supertree have greater than average 'evolutionary distinctiveness'. Where these are also imminently endangered, a powerful case can be mounted to prioritise their preservation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>1. We will construct the largest ever supertrees of arthropods by synthesising 5,000+ peer-reviewed cladograms from the literature. The Researcher Co-I and Data Clerk will archive these in Newick format along with rich metadata in XML (character type, analysis type, branch support measures and complete bibliographic information) that will add significant value. A SynTax-funded prototype and proof of principle for crabs is already online.

2. We will develop and implement new supertree algorithms, including quartet joining, conservative, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. These will be incorporated into new versions of the open-source Supertree Toolkit (STK) alongside MRP variants, making it the most versatile supertree software available. We will also include tools to test for adequate overlap; a necessary prerequisite for efficient analyses. We will additionally incorporate 'taxonomic awareness' enabling trees to be produced at various hierarchical levels with no recoding of the source trees. We will also explore and program measures of supertree support, of congruence/conflict between data partitions, and of congruence between our trees and stratigraphic data. The arthropod case-study will be used for benchmarking.

3. All data and tools will be embedded online, and linked to analytical software written in Python and released under GNU GPL. A user-friendly GUI will enable anyone to produce supertrees easily but rigorously from any sub-sample of the data, and by multiple methods. Users will also be able to upload their own trees and metadata, enabling our resource to grow organically. 

4. We will conduct several pilot studies for several focal clades (crabs, crayfish, bumblebees, dung beetles and butterflies). Specifically, we will collaborate with conservationists (Ben Collen and Richard Grenyer) to identify EDGE species, and to investigate the relationship between measures of phylogenetic spread and biogeographical distribution.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic Impact

This project stands as a proof of principle for managing, curating and maximising the impact of a much larger database of published trees than assembled hitherto, along with its associated metadata. The project entails the development and implementation of important new methods for supertree construction, with applications for evolutionary biology, ecology, behavioural science and conservation. It will create a lasting legacy for the wider academic community in the form of the revised Supertree Toolkit (STK) and its associated website. The latter will comprise data, software and in-built data processing capabilities, all of which will benefit the wider biological community in future projects. 
All of the new quartet joining, conservative, Bayesian and likelihood algorithms within the updated Supertree Toolkit will be released under an open source license, enabling other theoreticians and programmers to build upon its functionality. The front-end of the Toolkit will be easy for any researcher to use, and we envisage a lasting legacy from its redeployment on other groups of organisms. 

This project is keenly supported by researchers on all major arthropod clades, for whom our resources will offer a comprehensive synthesis of the state of published knowledge. It will also highlight where disparate sources of data concur, and where there is significant conflict necessitating further research. Collaborative links have already been established with: Jonathan Coddington, Smithsonian (Arachnida); Jason Dunlop, Museum f&amp;uuml;r Naturkunde (Chelicerata); Bill Shear, Hampden-Sydney College VA (Chilopoda); Adam Slipinski, CSIRO (Coleoptera); Geoff Boxshall, NHM (Copepoda and all Crustacea); Keith Crandall, Brigham Young (Decapoda); Greg Edgecombe, NHM (Diplopoda); Rudolf Meier, University of Singapore (Diptera); Richard Brusca (Isopoda); Stefan Richter, University of Rostock (Malacostraca); John Trueman (Odonata); Darren Mann, Oxford (Scarabaeida). 
This project wil generate robust supertrees for use in secondary analyses by conservationists, ecologists, ethologists and evolutionary biologists. More importantly, these workers will be able to produce their own trees using any desired data filtering and processing criteria, as well as using powerful new supertree methods. We have established links with Richard Grenyer (Geography, Oxford) and Ben Collen (Head of Indicators and Assessment Unit, ZSL) in order to design our resources with this objective in view. 

Economic and Societal Impact

Conservative estimates of the economic costs of biodiversity loss are around &amp;pound;40 billion per annum, although these figures are not currently included in estimates of GDP. An equivalent loss of 7% of GDP is predicted by 2050 if current rates continue. Approaches to conservation that simply count species are crude; the additional information imparted by large phylogenies allows evolutionary distinctiveness to be factored into policy-making decisions. This project will hugely simplify the synthesis of existing phylogenetic information for all groups by providing new methods and tools. It will specifically and immediately enhance our understanding of arthropod biodiversity; a clade containing 80% of all animal species. If our resource helps to slow the decline by just one thousandth of one percent over the next ten years (a modest claim), it's value might conservatively be placed at &amp;pound;4 million.
Public interest in biodiversity loss is enormous. The scale of this project, and the sheer size and inclusiveness of the trees that we will generate will make our work of great public interest. By adding an accessible 'public front end' to our website (linked to 'ARKive' images and species notes), we will improve public understanding of phylogeny and evolution, and raise awareness of the importance of, and applications for, systematics in general. This is of vital importance at a time when teaching of the discipline is declining.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398509</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>China Agricultural University (CAU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Chufei Tang and Professor Ding Yang from China Agricultural University</gtr:description><gtr:id>650E2191-082E-4496-8A26-EEB9B6D74F69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have two papers in preparation.

We quantify the levels of homoplasy in over 1,200 morphological character matrices
of animals using parsimony, and investigate its distribution across taxa and
throughout research time. No index of homoplasy is entirely satisfactory, and we explore
the empirical relationship between the ensemble consistency index (CI), the ensemble
retention index (strictly an index of retained synapomorphy), and the
homoplasy excess ratio (HER). We propose a refinement to the latter; specifically controlling
for the distribution of missing entries. We also investigate whether levels of homoplasy
predict levels of tree support; specifically mean non-parametric bootstrap
support, total support index (TSI) and proportional support index (PSI). Surprisingly, the
relationship is not especially strong. Lastly, we model the extent to which all homoplasy
and support indices are biased by data matrix dimensions, complementing the theoretical
work of Hoyal-Cuthill and colleagues. We find the expected inverse relationship
between the number of taxa and the CI, but also between the number of characters
and CI. The CI is therefore a poor measure of homoplasy between data sets. The RI
and modified HER are much less biased by dataset parameters, and yield similar results,
although we prefer the scaling of the latter. We demonstrate a significant decline
in the CI inferred for data sets over the last 30 years of research time, but this is
largely attributable to an increase in data set dimensions over the same period. Residual
CI and modified HER show no such trends. There are also significant differences
in homoplasy and branch support between higher taxa, which remain after modeling
out data set dimensions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.systass.org/biennial2015/SystematicsAssociationBiennialConferenceProgramme2015v2.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster: Davis KE, Hill J, Tovar J &amp; Wills MA. 2012.

Tools and methods for constructing the Tree of Life
University of York, 19th and 20th December, 2016

Evolutionary history, or phylogeny, is the backbone of systematics and knowledge of phylogeny is essential in a variety of fields within evolutionary biology; such as macroevolution, palaeontology, evolutionary ecology, and conservation. Non-specialists are increasingly in need of large, inclusive phylogenies for which there are two main methods of construction: the supermatrix and the supertree. For both methods, the main issues are collecting, curating and processing the source data. The individual sources will have individual tips and character data that do not match other sources due to misspellings, synonyms, or use of higher-level taxa. How do you correct this for hundreds or thousands of data sources? How do you efficiently collate hundreds of data sources? Supertrees combine a number of these overlapping source trees (source data) to then create the &amp;quot;supertree&amp;quot;. In contrast supermatrices take primary information from characters (including genes or morphological characters) and combine them into a single, large matrix. Both methods can be cumbersome and time-consuming when creating large phylogenies.

Tools and methods for constructing the Tree of Life
University of York, 19th and 20th December, 2016

Evolutionary history, or phylogeny, is the backbone of systematics and knowledge of phylogeny is essential in a variety of fields within evolutionary biology; such as macroevolution, palaeontology, evolutionary ecology, and conservation. Non-specialists are increasingly in need of large, inclusive phylogenies for which there are two main methods of construction: the supermatrix and the supertree. For both methods, the main issues are collecting, curating and processing the source data. The individual sources will have individual tips and character data that do not match other sources due to misspellings, synonyms, or use of higher-level taxa. How do you correct this for hundreds or thousands of data sources? How do you efficiently collate hundreds of data sources? Supertrees combine a number of these overlapping source trees (source data) to then create the &amp;quot;supertree&amp;quot;. In contrast supermatrices take primary information from characters (including genes or morphological characters) and combine them into a single, large matrix. Both methods can be cumbersome and time-consuming when creating large phylogenies. And, less obviously but no less vital, how do you even begin to visualise your output of 1000s tips in any meaningful way?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://jonxhill.wordpress.com/2016/11/15/tools-and-methods-for-constructing-the-tree-of-life/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Extinction in a Macroevolutionary Context - Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A421C91-C1C0-406C-8356-0BD9863784E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Culture, Memory &amp;amp; Extinction

Recent months have seen an explosion of public, media and academic interest in the idea, threat and reality of extinction. This acknowledgement has contributed to debates over climate change and other, related, ways that humanity has altered environments and ecosystems in this epoch we have begun to call the Anthropocene. This one-day conference asks what role can culture play in widening the understanding, representation and, indeed, remembrance of this unfolding and catastrophic species loss. With this in mind, the event aims to foster dialogue between academics, journalists, museum curators, charities, writers, environmental groups, and the media to explore how societies engage with the complexities of the processes of extinction and remember the extinct. More specifically, the event examines how increased dialogue between these communities and constituencies contributes to the public re-evaluation and remembrance of life on our planet.

Patterns of morphological and taxonomic diversity are often at odds. Specifically,
there is a tendency for groups to reach maximum levels of morphological disparity
relatively early in their evolutionary histories, even while species richness or
diversity is comparatively low. Early high disparity is evident not only in a diverse range
of animal clades but also major groups of vascular plants, suggesting it may represent
a universal evolutionary phenomenon. The shapes of disparity profiles through time
can be quantified in terms of their centre of gravity, with bottom heaviness (CG &amp;lt; 0.50)
being typical of extinct clades that do not terminate at a mass extinction. It is widely
supposed that increasing developmental constraints or ecological restrictions limit the
range of morphologies that can evolve within a clade; consistent with an observed
decrease in the rate of origination of novel bodyplans and higher taxa through time.
It has also been demonstrated that the rate of evolution of new character states decreases
through time, although the relationship between this 'character exhaustion'
and overall disparity has hitherto been untested. Here, we quantify the rate of character
exhaustion in 93 published phylogenies of extinct animal clades, and test for a
relationship with disparity profile centre of gravity. We find no significant correlation,
and conclude that patterns of early high disparity are not shaped by exhaustion of
the state space in any straightforward manner.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.systass.org/biennial2015/SystematicsAssociationBiennialConferenceProgramme2015v2.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We are still analysing our data and working these up into publications. We anticipate many more key findings down the line. Thus far, we have developed our software, the Supertree Toolkit, and made this available from the project website (http://supertreetoolkit.org/). We have used this to produce a supertree of Achelata as proof of concept (10.1371/journal.pone.0140110) and have extended our protocol (10.3897/BDJ.2.e1053) to other major clades. We now have supertrees of Anomura, Brachyura, Caridea, Euphausiacea, Odonata and Blattodea, with datasets of Culicidae, Formicidae, Nymphalidae, Scarabaeidae, Ephemeroptera, Scolytinae, Phthiraptera, Euphausiacee, Araneae and Myriapoda still being analysed. We relate our supertree of Anomura to changes in climate through deep time, and have demonstrated that, unusually, falls in temperature were associated with increased rates of diversification (the reverse is usually observed). A paper has been published in Nature Communications. We are also relating our tree of Caridea to major habitat shifts. We are additionally synthesising the first supertree of all decapods. We have also devised algorithms for producing the first complete supertrees, filling in the species coverage afforded in the literature and rigorously interpolating all known species into this structure. We have also developed new supertree methods, and we are currently working to integrate these with our software. We have also appraised our existing indices of stratigraphic congruence using a large corpus (600+) trees of arthropods and other taxa, and demonstrate how best to quantify the fit of cladograms to the fossil record. A paper has been published in Systematic Biology, and new/better indices are in development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our software is widely used by systematists, and our website and resources offer a benchmark for curating and archiving phyloinformatic data (trees and associated metadata). Large, inclusive supertrees are needed for comparative evolutionary analyses, and for informing conservation priorities. Species can be given an EDGE score (Evolutionarily Distinct and Globally Endangered) score, but complete phylogenies are necessary to do this. We have work in progress for the true crabs (Brachyura). Our arthropod supertrees are among the first such phylogenies, and we anticipate numerous collaborations and applications of our work in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E5F4B84A-F08B-4C90-8FC9-975827EC535F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://supertreetoolkit.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data from: Davis, K., Hill, J., Astrop, T. and Wills, M., 2016.

Such large phylogenies are useful for macroevolutionary studies, comparative biology and in conservation and biodiversity. No easy to use and fully integrated software package currently exists to carry out this task. Here, we present a new Python-based software package that uses well defined XML schema to manage both data and metadata. It builds on previous versions by 1) including new processing steps, such as Safe Taxonomic Reduction, 2) using a user-friendly GUI that guides the user to complete at least the minimum information required and includes context-sensitive documentation, and 3) a revised storage format that integrates both tree- and meta-data into a single file. These data can then be manipulated according to a well-defined, but flexible, processing pipeline using either the GUI or a command-line based tool. Processingsteps include standardising names, deleting or replacing taxa, ensuring adequate taxonomic overlap, ensuring data independence, and safe taxonomic reduction. This software has been successfully used to store and process data consisting of over 1000 trees ready for analyses using standard supertree methods. This software makes large supertree creation a much easier task and provides far greater flexibility for further work.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C18DDB98-5921-41BF-8C50-F4EFFFB08FA4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The software is new, but has already been used by 10 final year undergraduates in their
