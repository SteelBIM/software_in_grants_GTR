The partnership includes academics and practitioners in art history, Maori cultural inquiry, post-colonial studies, social anthropology, cultural studies of children and childhood, public health, art and design, aesthetics and the humanities. The main objective of ICACC is to bring the study and practices of the arts and cultural inquiry into productive encounter with childhood studies, and thereby to open up new questions and possibilities for thinking, research and practice. The impetus for establishing the Centre came from the arts-based research of Rachel Holmes during the present project. ICACC organised an exhibition at the Summer Institute in Qualitative Research, MMU, 18-22 July 2011.

The film was successful in stimulating questions about children and behaviour, and helping viewers to examine their existing preconceptions. Many respondents described an affective engagement, in words such as 'haunting', 'sad', 'sombre', 'sinister', 'disturbing'. This did not necessarily mean that the film was felt to be unsuccessful - some respondents found it, for those very reasons, 'powerful', 'emotional', 'unsettling in a good way'. The film also had cognitive impact, in helping interviewees think about particular issues, or relate the film to their own experiences: eg 'It made me think about how children's creativity can be interpreted as naughty'; 'it makes you think differently - outside the box'. There was diversity of views on certain issues such as: the need for greater 'structure' or explication; whether the film was too directive, or by contrast unclear in its message; whether the artistic qualities of the video were a strength, or might diminish the seriousness of its message. Rather than attempting to arbitrate, diverse views were incorporated where possible into the accompanying multi-user resource, as a way of further opening up questions. The film was generally felt by respondents to hold strong potential for use in pre-and inservice training for professionals and policy makers involved with young children and behaviour, and also as a stimulus to cross-professional engagement.



Production of final version of the film

The prototype film was re-edited and developed using Final Cut Pro editing software. User group responses informed all aspects of its development. Amendments were made in order to address: accessibility/comprehensibility; style, balance and range of views and voices represented; ethical practices in representations of children; copyright, where permission could not be obtained or was too costly. Amendments included: changes to duration, placement and style of text and images; minor changes to soundtrack; removal/substitution of images and clips; blurring or cropping of images.



Multi-user support materials

The accompanying materials are intended to be scalable, for use in small groups through to larger, multi-professional training sessions. It was important to build in flexibility, as respondents varied in the extent to which they felt the need for framing or structure. Users may therefore access the materials according to their interests and individual contexts, in the form of downloadable files when the film is accessed via the Internet, and as additional 'chapters' in the DVD version. The materials are organised thematically around five key themes: 'What counts as problem behaviour? 'What is a normal child?', 'Difficult bodies', 'Parents' and 'Observing and Monitoring'. Each theme comprises of relevant clips and images from the main film, accompanied by orienting questions, and additional visual and textual content. 



Additional downloadable materials include: worksheets for each theme; a short outline of the project and the aims of the film; a summary of user responses to the film; a summary of this report; a summary of the original 'Becoming a Problem' project; a list of publications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The film and materials have been commended by a Local Authority Director of Children's Services as a cross-professional resource, and we would anticipate their use in the provision of in-service training sessions. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services teams could use the film in a multi-professional training initiative with

teachers, particularly with a focus on children's social and emotional development. The film and resources could be incorporated into initial training and in-service programmes in HE and FE institutions, and could be included in Continued Professional Development Partnership offers. The film could also be used to raise awareness of issues concerning behavior and views of children amongst older school students. For instance as discussion material for teaching sessions. We anticipate that the film and resources can be adopted for use by an expanding range of professionals and groups who work with young children and/or behaviour and emotional development, and to be of particular value in cross- and multi-professional development. We expect to see it in use in training sessions by individual schools and consortia, Children's Services, Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, and initial and in-service training modules on behaviour and classroom management.



The project and film can contribute to public information and education about children and childhood, and to be of documented interest to parent groups, policy makers and the wider public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2CEF8891-C2D5-4A7D-AAA2-188D71EC6C0C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esri.mmu.ac.uk/resprojects/project_outline.php?project_id=127</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9A711B53-728E-4288-A103-273384FE4273"><gtr:id>9A711B53-728E-4288-A103-273384FE4273</gtr:id><gtr:title>Flesh, Wax, Horse Skin, and Hair</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cultural Studies ?
