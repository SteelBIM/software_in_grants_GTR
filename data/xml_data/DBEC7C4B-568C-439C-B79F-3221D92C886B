This describes the elaborate, and seemingly automatic, changes that take place in the way that a cell behaves under different circumstances. For example, cells grow when provided with the right nutrients, die if irrevocably damage, or differentiate into distinctly different types of cells when in the appropriate niche environment. Cells are sensitive to the signals that dictate changes to their programmes and thus to their behaviour at a particular time in their growth cycles. Often, to execute one programme means that others are disabled. These time-sensitive switches allow coordinated and absolute decisiveness to cells' fate. These switches are comprised of a family of proteins called SCF ligases, which directly control the cell's growth machinery. Understanding the how cells make their decisions and regulate cell fate is a matter of fundamental interest, and this proposal outlines experiments designed to understand the activity of SCF proteins, and how they achieve this. In particular we will focus on a component of this SCF called Fbxo7. It differentially regulates at least three different proteins that affect cellular proliferation, death, and differentiation. In other words, it is a master regulator. We want to understand how Fbxo7 is capable of varying its activity towards the proteins it binds, and ultimately how it controls cell fate. We will use a variety of methods to understand the protein's function, to solve its structure, and find other proteins that it regulates. By doing experiments to broaden our understanding of the proteins at the intersection of different cell programmes we hope to be able to affect and ultimately direct these programmes in clinically relevant settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligases control cell cycle progression by promoting the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of key regulators. These holoenzymes contain F box proteins (FBPs) which direct their interaction with substrates. The experiments outlined in this proposal will investigate how an unconventional F box protein, Fbxo7, has disparate activities towards its interacting proteins, stabilising some but enabling the degradation of others. This dual capacity distinguishes Fbxo7 from other F box proteins, and emphasizes the fact that F box proteins have novel activities that have not been investigated. The global objectives for this project are to understand the basis for the different capacities of Fbxo7, to shed light on how the family of FBPs target their substrates, and ultimately how SCF ligases direct and coordinate cellular processes, like proliferation and apoptosis. This will involve pursuing the following experimental objectives: - Determination of the important residues within Fbxo7 which affect its activity. This investigation will be based on structure/function and bioinformatics analyses, and analyse aspects such as dimerization, phosphorylation, and interactions with other proteins, which may regulate Fbxo7 activity; - Molecular analysis of essential residues in Fbxo7 for its major functions: as part of an SCF, in degradation or as a stabilizer of its substrates, or in determination of cellular responses in proliferation, apoptosis, and transformation; - Analysis of sub-cellular localization and kinetics of Fbxo7 expression and correlate these findings with substrate binding and its function; - Determination of the crystal structure of Fbxo7in complex with cyclin D/cdk6; - Identification of additional Fbxo7 interacting proteins, - Analysis of the mechanisms of Fbxo7-mediated apoptosis induction, including the pathways that regulate its activities and the downstream effectors that transduce its activity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>303064</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Science Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF6EBBFE-D41B-4233-81A4-BFB1C3F4069D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participation in the annual Cambridge Science Festival to tell the general public about the work ongoing in our laboratory. This year's attendance was in excess of 500 people. We also provide interactive games for young children to learn the principles of the genetic code and for older children and adults to diagnose different types of blood cancers. We produced an interactive exhibition using lasers to demonstrate fluorescence and luminescence and how we use this technology to further our work.

This is always a popular event in Cambridge, with a festival atmosphere and lots of families with children coming. Hopefully we are engaging with future scientists.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013,2015,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Summer Schools</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9396338C-5CA9-4A94-9F8E-103E11724877</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk that sparked people's interest in pursuing a career in science at Cambridge.

This was an especially rewarding year, as I met amongst my students a young woman of Jamaican/Nigeria heritage who remembered my talk from the BAME summer programme, and she said that she particularly was inspired to apply to Cambridge because I am a scientist born in Jamaica and am now working at Cambridge. Although she is only an example of one, I am very pleased to have personally affected a young scientist in this way.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>70000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD Studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Cambridge</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D1775362-867E-4818-87DC-4663F8F8183A</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>The finding that Fbxo7 is highly expressed in lung and colorectal cancers and is a pro-proliferative gene and is an anti-cancer target.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9AC8F368-5903-42C1-99F6-5D390F66E686</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>WO2004093919</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Use of an inhibitor of Fbx7 in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a cancer.</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A rabbit polyclonal antibody to Fbxo7</gtr:description><gtr:id>261D47B5-02D0-4E0C-AE4F-6DFE5A9C8154</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Yes</gtr:licensed><gtr:protection>Protection not required</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Fbxo7 antibody</gtr:title></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered a subclass of about 12% of F box proteins are regulated by a competitive interaction between the protein that enables it to be part of an enzyme and a second protein that shuttles it out of the nucleus. Thus the localisation of these subunits in the nucleus is linked to its capacity to be part of an enzyme. This mode of regulation was previously unappreciated, and we dissected the molecular aspects of this regulation. We characterised the typical and atypical functions of Fbxo7, and established that F-box proteins have numerous additional capacity, above and beyond that of engaging the UPS. This is an important consideration, especially in the light of the current interest in the therapeutic intervention with the ubiquitin ligases and the pathways they regulate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Therapeutic intervention with the ubiquitin pathway is currently being investigated by many small and large pharmaceutical companies.
