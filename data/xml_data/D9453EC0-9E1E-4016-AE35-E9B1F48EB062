While some evidence does suggest greater levels of oxytocin - and certain variants of the oxytocin receptor gene - are associated with greater kindness and well-being, new research suggests that the effects of oxytocin are not universally positive.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the present research, the researchers propose to develop a new model that integrate social factors related to interpersonal sensitivity (eg, how sensitive people are to others) with the oxytocin system in predicting well-being. The model is predicated on the principle of balance - specifically, that greater interpersonal sensitivity is beneficial to a certain a point, after which its effects can become maladaptive. To test predictions stemming from this model, the present research will incorporate both correlational and experimental designs to investigate how two social factors related to interpersonal sensitivity (attachment and self-construal) moderate the oxytocin system in two areas: At the gene level (oxytocin receptor gene) and at the hormone level (through experimental manipulation of blood oxytocin levels).&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Interesting in oxytocin application has centered on usage in clinical populations to treat various mental illnesses and as a general public pharmaceutical for increasing well-being. The present research is likely to make an impact in both arenas.

Amongst clinicians, oxytocin has been proposed to treat various mental illnesses, including autism, phobias, and borderline personality disorder. However, since the underlying effects of oxytocin are still poorly understood, the applicability of oxytocin to treat these illnesses is questionable. The present work will provide new evidence for oxytocin's functionality to center on boosting interpersonal sensitivity. Understanding this global function of oxytocin will allow clinicians to apply oxytocin to illnesses specifically characterized by deficits in interpersonal sensitivity. 

The present work also has potential to make a large impact on regulators and private enterprises engaged in the selling of oxytocin nasal sprays to the general public. Companies, such as Liquid Trust, promise users greater levels of intimacy, lower levels of anxiety, and higher levels of trust. However, recent work suggests that the benefits of oxytocin are selective, and in fact, many individuals may experience no benefits and some potentials detriments from oxytocin usage. My proposal offers a framework for understanding who may benefit from oxytocin usage and a mechanism for why. Furthermore, by working with regulators and private enterprises, I hope to help develop tools for screening individuals who may benefit from those who may experience detriments when using oxytocin.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>245714</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Oxytocin and Well-being</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FFC07DA-EB08-481F-9006-1036E44AC7C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still ongoing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners are contributing their expertise in selection study measures and materials.

First, the rs53576 genotype has three possible genotypes (GG, GA, AA). However, the AA genotype is less common (occurs in only 10% in the Caucasian population), and thus most previous work has had few participants with this genotype. This led to most previous analyses treating the GA and AA groups as the same. This assumes that the impact of rs53576 is binary: a person has the A allele or they do not. However, we are finding that AA and GA are different. In particular, the groups appear to line up linearly in impact, with the AA and GA representing extremes, and GA being in the middle.

Second, we have found that people who are low in attachment avoidance (tendency to be distrusting of others and thus keeping people at arms length) tend to show greater positive coping behaviour if they have more G alleles (GG &amp;gt; GA &amp;gt; AA). However, for individuals high in attachment avoidance, there is little impact of rs53576 on positive coping.

Third, individuals with lower subjective social class also show a benefit to having more G alleles for their positive coping behaviour; individuals high in social class show little association between rs53576 and positive coping.

The last two findings collectively are underscoring the interplay between social and biological factors in influencing how we have, in particular in relation to processes that contribute to well-being.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once we complete our research, our findings will be of interest to researchers who are working in the areas of sociability, well-being, and oxytocin.

In particular, we administer intranasally either oxytocin or placebo to each participant, and ask them to partake in a number of social behavioural tasks (focusing on well-being, prosociality, morality, and emotional processes). Before they come to the lab, they also complete a number of individual difference questionnaires. Our goal is to understand how individual differences moderate the impact oxytocin make on social processes. The study is unique in the literature in particular for its sample size; most previous work has been extremely underpowered to detect moderations because of their small sample sizes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>912159B7-16AC-4ABB-B9B0-A286AB092274</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data collection is presently completing.

Each individual completed a number of behavioural and survey tasks online using our custom written software suite. What is unique about this data collection is that rather than collecting a random sample of participants--as has been the case in every previous rs53576 study we are aware of--we recruited in equal numbers across the 3 possible genotypes. This is especially helpful given that one of the genotypes (AA) is relatively rare in the population (less than 10%) and so most previous studies have had very small sample sizes of this genotype. We are currently writing several manuscripts based on this dataset exploring how social class and attachment moderate the impact of rs53576 on various social outcomes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0CAB901A-1470-4D32-AEB5-277B77155767</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications are currently being prepared.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Genetics Study A</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E78C544C-B65B-4787-A05C-3013BBFBD1CC"><gtr:id>E78C544C-B65B-4787-A05C-3013BBFBD1CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>On wealth and the diversity of friendships: High social class people around the world have fewer international friends</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Personality and Individual Differences</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2be8a006a3b6f4523905dd741f034a93"><gtr:id>2be8a006a3b6f4523905dd741f034a93</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yearwood M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K008331/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EE9084A7-FE6C-4C9D-A9CD-9DE995623422</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EFFEC6B1-6BC8-4C9D-9D77-02CEF5E4E301</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomedical neuroscience</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>56C9394E-9F52-4433-9619-6A14493473A8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
