A dramatic example of this is the expansion of tundra shrubs. Shrubs are an important part of the Arctic carbon cycle and major contributors to feedbacks facilitating high-latitude climate warming. The April 2014 IPCC Impacts report assigned a high confidence in the detection of an increase in shrubs in Arctic ecosystems and attributes shrub expansion to climate warming. However currently, the relative importance of climate versus other biological or environmental factors as drivers of tundra shrub growth and expansion remains poorly understood. 

Over the next century tundra ecosystems are predicted to warm by 2 - 10C. A significant unknown is whether shrubs will rapidly respond to warming conditions, or whether environmental factors such as water availability, nutrient limitation, herbivory, pathogen outbreaks, or fire will begin to limit the rate of future vegetation change. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to: 1) quantify the importance of climate as a driver of tundra shrub growth and expansion at sites across the tundra biome, 2) test the correspondence between plot-scale field observations with remotely-sensed data of tundra greening, 3) analyse the correlations between time series of shrub growth, tundra greening and climate and 4) assess the agreement between patterns of tundra greening and vegetation change at the landscape-scale.

Our key objectives are:
1) To scale tundra vegetation change-climate interactions from plot to biome: We will integrate locally-collected data from sites around the Arctic and remotely-sensed data to test a) whether growing season temperatures are the primary driver of tundra vegetation change and b) whether remotely-sensed greening data capture a signal that correlates with spatial and temporal variation in local-scale shrub expansion. 
2) To link patterns of tundra greening and vegetation change at the landscape scale: To scale from plot to biome at our focal research site Herschel Island, we will collect high spatial resolution (&amp;lt; 10 cm pixel) tundra greening data using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) to compare with vegetation monitoring data, plant trait measurements, disturbance rates and terrain characteristics. 
3) To improve predictions of tundra vegetation change: We will integrate our research findings to make data-driven predictions of shrub increase across the tundra biome. We will conduct a data synthesis workshop in 2017 to integrate our research objectives, evaluate the future research priorities and synthesize our findings.

This proposed research is both timely and urgent, as the required biome-scale datasets have only recently become available in long-enough duration, and the technologies, methodological approaches and statistical techniques are only now refined sufficiently to test mechanisms of shrub expansion across spatial and temporal scales. Our findings will provide fundamental insights into the drivers of shrub growth and tundra greening and will enable improved predictions of future tundra vegetation change.

The proposed research will result in the generation of a publically available dataset that will provide key estimates of tundra vegetation change to the broad scientific community. We will disseminate results through timely publications in internationally recognized journals and presentations at major conferences, knowledge exchange, ecological assessments, public engagement, and media. Lastly, the project will provide comprehensive training, mentorship and networking opportunities for early career researchers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this research on vegetation change in tundra ecosystems will be relevant and of interest to policy makers, northern human communities, the media and the general public. In order to disseminate this research programme, we will build upon our previous extensive outreach and engagement experience, to provide summarized results to all stakeholders. Our activities will be targeted to UK, northern and global audiences. We will focus engagement in two primary areas: 1) global change impacts in tundra ecosystems and in particular vegetation change and 2) open science, collaboration and coordinating international scientific collaborations. 

Policy Makers
Policy makers at a variety of levels make decisions about climate change mitigation, conservation of biodiversity, resource extraction and preservation of natural heritage. Understanding the vegetation changes currently underway and the projected extent of future changes in Arctic ecosystems will allow policy makers at the international, national, territorial and local levels to evaluate options that will best protect natural capital such as ecosystem functions ecosystem carbon stores, and wildlife species e.g.,caribou, muskox, and artic fox. We will communicate the scientific findings through knowledge exchange including ecological impact assessments. Our findings will provide key data to ecological and climate modellers who are estimating feedbacks to climate warming.

Northern Communities
Northern communities have a vested interest in understanding how their local lands are being altered by global change including warming temperatures, reduced sea ice and extended growing seasons. In order to conduct globally relevant research, scientists must bring results back to the local communities where the research is being conducted. During this research project, we will strive to effectively communicate research findings to those living in communities in close proximity to the research sites including Inuvik, Aklavik and Whitehorse. The research group will conduct school visits, give community presentations and interact with park managers to share our findings.

General Public
Changes to Arctic ecosystems are some of the most dramatic examples of climate change impacts. The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the world due to amplification of energy feedbacks. The observed rapid loss of sea ice, permafrost thaw, tundra fires and the dramatic responses of tundra vegetation are impacts that can be easily communicated to a global audience. An improved understanding of climate change impacts to northern ecosystems will influence behaviours and shape attitudes towards climate mitigation policies as well as informing the public about important ecological interactions and earth system processes. Our research group will engage with traditional media outlets and social media to communicate our findings and contribute to the growing body of evidence outlining climate impacts in Arctic ecosystems.

Early Career Researchers
We are only beginning to be able to estimate future impacts of climate change in tundra ecosystems. This is an emerging field that will grow over time. We need to train highly skilled scientists who have an interdisciplinary understanding of ecology, evolution and earth system science and who additionally have advanced skills in statistical and spatial analysis, field and laboratory techniques, taxonomy and communication. This project will provide training, mentorship and expertise in a variety of research skills to the ~7 participating early career researchers (6 undergraduate students and one postdoc) and will also present opportunities for these young scientists to build an extensive research network and establish their own future careers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>533956</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>sTundra</gtr:description><gtr:id>EA30FD26-6E0B-4A5B-A474-B2737330F99B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has thus far resulted in the following publication and three in prep. manuscripts that are to be submitted in 2016:

Students in their final year got to meet scientists from various STEM backgrounds and ask questions about their career paths. PhD student Sandra Angers-Blondin attended to discuss graduate studies and Arctic research with the pupils. 

The aim of the activity was to expose students to the breadth of career options available to them in science. Students circulated around the room in pairs, spending 5 minutes with each visiting scientist to ask questions about their line of work. Students reported that &amp;quot;the event opened [their] eyes to the vast number of job opportunities there are from studying a science at university. Talking to [scientists] about how they got to where they are was really useful.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Our Changing World Lecture Series - The Greening of the Arctic</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA26DE4D-2B59-43F9-B415-3D5BD14B940A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Isla Myers-Smith gave the Our Changing World Lecture entitled 'The Greening of the Arctic' on 8 November, 2016 in Edinburgh, Scotland.

1. Weak correspondence among satellite-observed tundra greening and on-the-ground observations of tundra vegetation change across the tundra biome.

2. Evidence of dramatic vegetation change over a 15-year period on Qiqiktaruk - Herschel Island in the Canadian Arctic.

3. Different greening patterns across different vegetation types in relation to disturbance regime, bare ground cover, soil moisture and topography.

4. Synchrony in greenness trends across the growing season from drone-sensed imagery and on-the-ground plant phenology records (leaf emergence, flowering, senescence). 

Remaining questions to address include:
1. How are community-level plant traits changing overtime in tundra ecosystems?

2. How does plant composition change influence greening patterns and tundra ecosystem functions over space and time with warming?

3. How do tundra greening patterns and trends over time correspond across spatial scales from different satellite records, drone imagery and on-the-ground observations?</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are contributing to international collaborations as a part of the sTundra working group:
https://www.idiv.de/?id=172

As a direct result of the project, new collaborations are being forged including the SynergyDrone workshops (lead by Aarhus University, Denmark) and the high-latitude drone ecology network (lead by the Tundra Ecology Research Group at the University of Edinburgh):

As the project progresses, the findings will be further integrated into collaborative research efforts, scientific publications, government reports, climate/environmental impact assessments and outreach initiatives.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F9E6B5F7-A55E-40B1-A17C-6CE40D1CCD04</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
