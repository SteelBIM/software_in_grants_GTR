&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to examine the importance of education, relative to that of other factors, in determining individuals? chances of social mobility in Britain over recent decades&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to investigate the social processes through which education actually impacts on mobility chances.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>Research questions include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Is education more important in promoting the upward mobility of individuals from disadvantaged social backgrounds than in helping individuals with greater family resources to maintain their parents? positions?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How far do individuals? mobility chances reflect their basic cognitive abilities and various non-cognitive attributes and how far do formal qualifications affect these chances independently of such psychological characteristics?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Are qualifications obtained during the period of full-time education becoming increasingly crucial for mobility chances or do individuals who leave school with only modest qualifications still have appreciable opportunities of ?working their way up??&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How important in this regard are economic conditions at the time when individuals first enter the labour market?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project will be primarily based on three British birth cohort studies covering individuals born in 1946, 1958 and 1970. The research will use advanced techniques of statistical analysis, such as path analysis with categorical variables and simultaneous hazard modelling.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>520435</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Has social mobility in Britain declined?

In this context, our research has generated a great deal of interest and we have been active in disseminating the results we have obtained and discussing their implications with a range of interested parties, as summarised below.
Government
We have given invited presentations in the Cabinet Office, the Treasury (twice) and the Department of Local Government and Communities.
We have acted as consultants to the Government Office of Science in connection with their Future Foresight of Skills project and have taken part in a workshop organised by the GOS in connection with this project.
For the duration of its existence - 2012 and 2016 - Co-I John Goldthorpe served as a member of the Social Mobility Transparency Board, established within the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, and was able to draw on our research in order to inform several initiatives taken by the Board.
Third Sector
We have throughout been in close touch with the Sutton Trust and together with them submitted a research grant proposal, in extension of our project, to ESRC. This was not supported but a revised version of the proposal has now been funded by the Nuffield Foundation and research is under way. We have also given assistance to Boston Consulting Group, who are working with the Sutton Trust in compiling a general review of the state of social mobility in Britain.
Through her position as Senior Research Fellow in the Oxford Martin School, University of Oxford, PI Erzs&amp;eacute;bet Bukodi has established links between our work and the Employment, Equity and Growth project, funded by the Resolution Foundation and directed by Professor Brian Nolan. Some joint research, comparing mobility in Britain with that in other European nations, is now in progress. 
General Public
Several of the papers we have published have attracted significant media attention, and we have taken the opportunity to disseminate the results of our research and analysis as widely as possible, including through BBC interviews and articles published in Prospect and the Observer.
Co-I John Goldthorpe used the occasion of the inaugural British Academy Lecture in Sociology to present an overview of our research and to raise related policy issues. There was a large, overflow audience and a good deal of correspondence with members of the public has ensued. In addition, requests for the text of the lecture (now published) were received from the Cabinet Office and also from the Sutton Trust, the Resolution Foundation and Policy Exchange. Discussions have in each case followed and seem likely to continue.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>11394125-9CFA-48A0-8D8F-5BD79F5C6A17</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There has been no decline in absolute rates of intergenerational social mobility in Britain if mobility is treated in terms of social class. However, there has been change in the upward and downward components of the total rate. Among cohorts born in the first half of 20th century the upward component steadily increased while the downward component decreased. But across the four cohorts referred to above the trend has been in the reverse direction. As regards relative rates of intergenerational class mobility - i.e. the relative chances of individuals of different class origins being found in different class destinations - these are also essentially stable across our four cohorts, at least so far as men are concerned: i.e. 'constant social fluidity' prevails. With women, some increase in fluidity is found - i.e. relative chances become more equal. However, this trend is not general. It is confined to women who at some stage have worked part-time. 
In considering the role of education in social mobility, the foregoing findings indicate that this can easily be exaggerated so far as societal levels are concerned. Levels of both absolute and relative class mobility have changed little over a historical period in which educational expansion and reform have been more or less continuous. Several further of our findings are important in this regard. Across our cohorts, there is little reduction in inequalities in educational attainment of children from different social backgrounds - and even when early life cognitive ability is controlled. Moreover, this lack of change shows up still more clearly if (a) parental status and parental education are also treated as components of social origin along with parental class and (b) education is treated in relative rather than in absolute terms. The 'class returns' to education have not increased. If education is considered in absolute terms the class returns appear in fact to decrease: i.e. there is evidence of 'over-qualification'. For example, the concept of the 'graduate job' would seem to be disappearing. If education is treated in relative terms there is no trend in the class returns. There is, then, little indication of greater social fluidity resulting from a movement towards an 'education-based meritocracy' in which individuals' class positions are determined primarily by the level of their qualifications at labour market entry. While there is some increase in the numbers of individuals moving directly from higher education into the managerial and professional positions, there is no evidence of a decline in the chances of upward mobility being achieved over the course of working life. 
Overall, our findings point to an essential stability - or powerful resistance to change - in what might be called the 'endogenous mobility regime', albeit within the context of significant class structural change. We would see the main source of this stability as lying in the fact that in families holding more advantaged class positions a strong motivation to avoid downward mobility ('loss aversion') coexists with superior resources - economic, cultural and social - that can be directed to this end.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Main findings suggest that a policy focus on education as a means of increasing the overall amount of mobility, and especially of upward mobility, is questionable. In increasing rates of upward mobility, economic policy would seem more relevant: that is, policy aimed at creating more 'top-end' jobs in both the public and the private sectors; otherwise, the increasing numbers of the higher-educated risks resulting in increased 'over-qualification'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>705E810D-52B3-4A28-AA8A-459C7AD5338E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>John H.

The National Child Development Study and 1970 British Cohort Study Educational Qualifications Histories, 1981-2009 provides a continuous and comprehensive account of National Child Development Study (NCDS) and 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) cohort members' educational qualifications histories between the ages of 16 and 38. The two data-sets are fully harmonised, which facilitates cross-cohort comparison.

This study includes two datasets, one derived from the BCS70 and one the other one from the NCDS. Both are providing detailed information on the following: cohort members' sex; date and age cohort members left full-time education; type, year and date of academic qualification; highest academic qualification attained; type, year and date of occupational qualification; highest vocational qualification attained; type, year and date of vocational / occupational (combined) qualification attained; highest (academic and vocational combined) qualification obtained</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0BCBF5F-AE82-4C0E-B8E9-52D29A8EEE82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>National Child Development Study and 1970 British Cohort Study Educational Qualifications Histories, 1981-2009.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BB9770BE-778B-404E-A5C8-EB1D7C7F7D47"><gtr:id>BB9770BE-778B-404E-A5C8-EB1D7C7F7D47</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Non-cognitive' skills: What are they and how can they be measured in the British cohort studies?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/709e1c608bfbc4a8476cb95037765ade"><gtr:id>709e1c608bfbc4a8476cb95037765ade</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joshi H.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/60B1BD7C-455D-42EF-93AD-2A294C066BD4"><gtr:id>60B1BD7C-455D-42EF-93AD-2A294C066BD4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is Education Now Class Destiny?
