So commonplace are animals in human lives as pets, metaphors, instruments for use, food, and so on that they are often ignored. This is a silence that is currently being addressed in numerous ways and by many different humanities disciplines at international conferences and in specialist journals such as Society and Animals, Worldviews, Anthrozoos. 
It is also an issue that is of growing critical and academic concern more generally, as witnessed in the number of articles concerned with animals in 'mainstream' academic journals, and in the growing 'animal lists' being established by publishers in North America and Europe. As such, this proposal is timely and the establishment of a Network for UK based scholars working in the field of Animal Studies would, without doubt, contribute to a further and fuller analysis of human history and culture. 
The Network would also provide an opportunity for scholars from across the UK to meet on a regular basis. Work in Animal Studies is currently being undertaken by scholars in literary studies, history, film studies, cultural studies, art history, philosophy, childhood studies, anthropology, human geography, and other disciplines, and, as my experience working with the Animal Studies Group (an informal, unfunded group of eight scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds, which was established in 2000, and whose book Killing Animals was published by the University of Illinois Press in 2006) has shown, such cross-disciplinary conversations are exceptionally important in a field such as
Animal Studies.

The Network would be organised around ten meetings held over a two-year period. These meetings would vary in format. Some would include papers given by invited speakers on a particular theme of relevance to a variety of areas in Animal Studies. Such themes would include, for example, anthropomorphism, companion animals, and representations of animals. 
Other meetings would take the form of discussions of particular reading materials led by scholars with expertise in the relevant field. Such reading materials might include Jacques Derrida's late work on animals; classic anthropological work such as that by Claude Levi-Strauss or Mary Douglas; key texts in contemporary ethical debates concerning the status of animals. It is proposed that at five of the ten proposed meetings key overseas scholars would be invited to give lectures and lead discussions. In this way the British Animal Studies Network would provide a forum not only for UK-based scholars in the field, it would also embrace work currently being undertaken overseas.
The overall aim of the network would be to disseminate new research from a range of disciplinary perspectives to scholars in different disciplines and to engage in debates between scholars from different disciplinary backgrounds and with different expertise.
The benefits of such a Network would be to strengthen the work of individual scholars by providing a format for debate about current research; to allow debates across disciplinary and institutional boundaries; to establish a network of scholars who might collaborate, support and help to develop each other's work. Finally, the long term legacy of such a proposal would be that relationships between scholars working in different fields would be established thus allowing Animal Studies to develop in truly interdisciplinary ways.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>17666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Farm - BASN meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E60E092A-132E-4274-8683-FF5D635946C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting of the British Animal Studies Network took place at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, and focused on farming, and human-farm animal relations.

Richardson is a poet with a vast experience of engagement with public audiences - as both performer and educator. She is currently poet-in-resident with the Marine Conservation Society's 'Thirty Threatened Species' project, encouraging involvement with wildlife conservation through the running of public poetry workshops, the writing of new marine wildlife-themed poetry and the performance of this work at festivals and other events throughout the UK. She has previously facilitated workshops and been commissioned to produce poetry for 'Earth Hour', WWF's annual global lights-off event, as well as for Friends of the Earth's 'Bee Cause' campaign. Her expertise in writing, teaching and in the relationship between humans and animals makes her an ideal leader for this workshop which is funded by the School of Humanities English Research Fund at the University of Strathclyde. The aim of the workout is to afford PG students the opportunity to explore how they might best present their work to a wider-than-academic audience. In addition, the workout will be a networking opportunity, and lunch will be provided for students at the end of the 2-hour session.

The workshop has been organised to take place directly before the 2017 meeting of the British Animal Studies Network at the University of Strathclyde. All PGs involved in the workshop will attend this meeting which will afford further opportunities for networking. Some of the PGs who are attending the workshop are giving papers at this meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.britishanimalstudiesnetwork.org.uk/FutureMeetings/Hearing.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cold-Blood(ed) - BASN meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C47644F-8857-466C-AB91-27D2482ADF33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This meeting of the British Animal Studies Network took place at the University of Cardiff on 9-10 October 2015.

A seminar took place every c3 months from May 2007 to February 2009. This was the first time that scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Animal Studies had come together over a series of meetings to discuss key ideas in this emergent field. A regular audience of 40 people (100 for the final meeting) listened to 3 papers at each session. The three papers came from different disciplines and reflected different approaches to a similar subject matter. Plenty of time was given over to q&amp;amp;a sessions and to refreshment/socialising as it is often during these times that important networking can take place. Speakers came from a range of disciplines: history, literature, geography, art history, philosophy, ecocriticism, cultural theory, media studies, film studies, education studies, anthropology, among others. Audience members included not only academics but also artists and activists involved in related work. Speakers and attendees came from across the UK, continental Europe, North America, and Australasia.

The British Animal Studies Network was reformed when I moved institution to the University of Strathclyde, and it's first meeting there was in May 2012. Since then two meetings have taken place a year, and now one meeting will be held at a different institution every year, organised by an invited director. The aim is to continue to allow space for interdisciplinary discussions even as animal studies has expanded to the extent that single discipline conferences/meetings are common. BASN remains the key place for such interdisciplinary discussions. Since moving to Strathclyde more emphasis has also been placed on inviting speakers from outside of academia: these include, to date, those working in NGOs (RSPB, RSPCA); a musician; artists. The BASN website - www.britishanimalstudiesnetwork.org.uk - now also has an archive of audio files of many of the papers delivered at the meetings which are reaching a wider audience - I have heard from colleagues in the USA, and in China, who are using these audio recordings in their work and teaching. The network remains international in its reach.

As well, relationships forged at BASN meetings have led to collaborations that could not have taken place without the meetings. I was invited to participate in an EU-funded project on agricultural animal welfare standards (Welfare Quality) in 2009; colleagues at Scotland's Rural College have been able to engage with a colleague from the RSPCA on a government funded project on adolescents' attitudes to animal cruelty following meeting at a BASN meeting in May 2014. Other research collaborations are facilitated by encounters at the meetings, which are also enabling us to keep up with work in others' disciplines; and to engage in long term discussions rather than have brief encounters.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.britishanimalstudiesnetwork.org.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2007,2008,2009</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The network led to a number of outcomes, some of which were non-academic (or involved non-academic participants):
