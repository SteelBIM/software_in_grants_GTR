Internet into nearly every aspect of our daily lives has stimulated the growth of a vibrant and expanding set of systems to support social interaction via a range of internet connected devices. Often collectively referred to as social media this set of applications and services are undergoing a highly unstable and dynamic growth as society shapes and is shaped by the emergence of these new capabilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To gain insight and understanding into human behaviour researchers have exploited a variety of data analytic techniques from a variety of social science disciplines. These have been used, for example, to automatically derive users? personality traits, predict and even influence societal outcomes, and to provide accounts of critical societal events.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this project we will develop a set of services and facilities for the social sciences that will allow researchers to draw upon social media and associated human data to gain insights into human behaviour in a manner that is ethically sound.The process of iterative refinement and release of tools will be complemented by a series of ethical and policy debates to elaborate the handling of Human Data.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work of this project will have applications across a wide range of disciplines, in particular among researchers wishing to understand human behaviour. The project will develop data repositories for use by researchers both inside and outside of academia, which combine social media data with other sources of information in privacy-preserving ways; however, primary impact will be the tools and facilities made available for future work.

Through public engagement and communications activities we aim to raise awareness in the public at large of the ethical issues currently surrounding social media and privacy, and aim to illuminate best practice.

Commercially, many organizations do not understand the legal, never mind ethical, challenges in personal data and we aim to raise this awareness level in Horizon partners organizations and more broadly to ensure companies can build and maintain trust with their customers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>404439</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short film was produced to illustrate the main recommendations that children and young people suggested about how to make internet safer</gtr:description><gtr:id>18CBFE1F-CE61-44CB-87E8-01A68F1279F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This short film was launch at the Web We Want festival as well as at the iRights launch.

Melvyn began his education studying A 'level Art and Design with Art History and Media Studies at Clarendon College (Nottingham), from 1983 to 1985. From there he enrolled upon a one year Foundation Course at Trent Polytechnic from to of 1986 and went on to gain a place ar St. Martin's School of Art in London that same year.
Unfortunately, due to illness, Melvyn had to quit his studies. In May, 1987 he was put on a six month section order under the Mental Health Act. There began a series of admissions into hospital and he was diagnosed with Schizo-affective
disorder.
Melvyn has stayed out of hospital for the past 20 years, and gained much insight into the ways of the mind; in illness and in health. For the past 15 years he has created artwork from his studio space on Carrington St in Nottingham and
continues to be influenced by the affairs of Mankind - his folly and his wisdom, the World at war and the World at peace.
About the artwork
&amp;quot;As an artist, I'm particularly interested in the affairs of Mankind; its religion, its politics, its World -as it is and, maybe, as it should be. I believe in one God, but many cultures, creeds, races and religions. I believe that God can transcend our differences, by focusing on our common humanity and needs as people -a world in union in a cosmopolitan pluralistic multi-faceted civilisation. There is a thread of interested in the theological that runs through my work, and a concern for the well-being of all people of the World through different cultures, belief systems, religions and the oneness expressed therein.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E395B582-4A55-4512-9361-DDD01E3A3307</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The launch of this exhibition was accompanied by a round table about religion and mental health.

Staring at the Sea by Mark Taylor
The work for this exhibition reflects my interest in the transcendental nature of the sea. Human culture and society are inexorably connected to the sea as the sea offers sustenance, hope and renewal. However, it also offers fear, uncertainty and incredible destructive power. Like many others I find myself drawn to the sea through what seems like a primal urge coupled with a fascination at the spectacle. The work I present here focuses on the calming influence of the sea and my personal connection with it. 

From a young age I have had to learn to cope with high levels of anxiety and bouts of clinical depression. This has to a large extent shaped my approach to personal work which often manifests itself as a form of therapy. In this instance, staring at the sea is something that becomes a meditative and contemplative experience. I enjoy the open space and the minimal aspect. The subtle interplay of light and colour between the Sea, sky and horizon offers an ever-changing aesthetic. The photographs in this exhibition are an attempt to reflect this. 
I take photographs here and there and then I spend hours patiently sieving through and find commonalities and connections, then classify them into to subject areas. This series is a combination of past work with additional new work made particularly for this show. There is a paradox of permanency and the ephemeral in windows/reflections . Eyes may be 'the window of the soul' but to me photographing windows/reflections is 'soothing of the soul' and more effective than medication for depression. 

Through a Glass Darkly by Tony Fisher
The work I am showing is concerning windows: reflections/mirroring what they physically look like, what can be seen through them or what we can be seen from them and how the elements interact with them. Some of the photographs show decay and deprivation, some express hope and a new beginning and others just show absurdity and a sense of fun.</gtr:description><gtr:id>43808CCF-2C4C-404B-AA71-A0B08719BCF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The launch of the exhibition is attended by mental health service users, art students and mental health professionals and researchers creating a space to promote social inclusion and reduce social isolation among service users.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Dissimilar Reflections</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.institutemh.org.uk/x-about-us-x/art-at-the-institute</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A groups of mental health service users took part in a clay course designed to study the effects of clay practice.

We all dream. We have day dreams and night dreams. Sometimes mental illness can feel like a waking nightmare, especially psychosis. Art can help us see through our dreams. Art can show our hurts, our hopes and our happiness. Dreams can express the boundaries between the hidden and the obvious, the conscious and the unconscious. The 7th Institute of Mental Health Open exhibition, run in partnership with City Arts, is an opportunity for everyone interested in the overlap between Mental Health and the Arts to submit their art work.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D712687-D34C-42BA-8F50-79E91D440913</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mental Health awareness</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Dreams: hurts, hopes and happiness</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.city-arts.org.uk/call-entries-exhibition-addressing-dreams-mental-health/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A stand-up comedy routine as part of Nesta's FutureFest and Science ShowOff event &amp;quot;My Other Future&amp;quot;, two evenings of comedy that poke fun at common visions of the future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F61CADF3-5F21-45EF-A50A-917AF629FD57</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Audience members approached me after the event to express their appreciation and say that this had made them think more deeply about the way in which they are using social media platforms.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Nesta: Future Fest Fringe, London, 4th Mar 2015</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/my-other-future-futurefest-fringe-events</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>iRights</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>iRights Youth Juries</gtr:description><gtr:id>815F3232-EDE1-49B5-B45F-ED0E4D750C3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>P&amp;eacute;rez E, Koene A, Carter C J, Statache R, et al.

This one-day event, organised by the European Commission, was centred around the progress made in creating a Digital Single Market in Europe.
The event was of particular interest to CaSMa for three reasons: 1. the panel discussion on on-line platforms, which we did some work on in relation to a call for evidence from the House of Lords; 2. understanding the social and ethical implications of the move towards a Digital Single Market; 3. discussions about the implications of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The event also provided an excellent opportunity for networking at an EU level.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital4eu</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pint of Science. iRights Youth Juries</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FA9F825A-DE41-4637-88DF-2EEC39F99515</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Pint of Science festival aims to deliver interesting and relevant talks on the latest science research in an accessible format to the public - all in the pub!

It is run mainly by volunteers and was established by a community of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in 2012. The main festival takes place annually over three days in the month of May simultaneously in pubs across the world. Pint of Science is a non-profit organisation.
I presented the work on the iRights Youth Juries and a few attendees expressed and interest in participating in future juries. Many attendees expressed that they learned about their digital rights (e.g, right to online privacy).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://pintofscience.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Algorithmic accountability and transparency in the Digital Economy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB5C1C66-6A74-403E-B692-4C5230844EF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main idea behind this public roundtable is to discuss which options the European Union has to improve the accountability and/or the transparency of the algorithms that underpin many business models and platforms in the digital single market.

To date, the blog has attracted more than 5,000 views and over 400 subscribers. During the last year, the CaSMa blog has posted more than 70 blogs, received many comments from followers (n&amp;gt;39) and several requests for guest posts (e.g. World Wide Web Foundation (webfoundation.org).
The blog is a valuable tool to publicize events, showcase current research projects and inform the public about current topics on social media research as well as provide a platform for the public to engage and communicate with the CaSMa team. For example, after the last public engagement event organised at Nottingham Contemporary, one of the attendees posted:

'Hello, I attended the most recent event. The event was organised masterfully and conducted with the utmost dignity and professionalism yet remained safe, supportive, engaging and thought provoking, it was &amp;quot;real&amp;quot;.

At the end of the debate I posed the question, &amp;quot;is the emerging phenomenon of digital interaction a window into Jung's collective unconscious.&amp;quot; This could be refined into a debate/exploration of virtual social groups and crowd consensus or dissension on the internet and perhaps their effects on the physical world.

please email me if you for further thoughts.'

Evidence that the CaSMa blog is reaching policy makers is evident from two occasions:
On December 7th 2015, following a blog post regarding the House of Lords inquiry into online platforms we were contacted:
Dear Dr Koene,
 I just noticed your short blog on the Lords inquiry into online platforms, particularly commenting on the question relating to algorithms.
Would you care to respond to our inquiry, on that one question? You clearly have a lot of expertise in this area. A page or two would be sufficient and would certainly enrich the debate.
The only issue is that we will stop accepting submissions on the 10th of this month.
Nevertheless, given that you have already more or less written it
Best,
Kilian

On January 5th 2016, following blog posts on the draft Investigative Powers Bill we were contacted:
Dear Ansgar,
I work with the team leading on the Investigatory Powers Bill in the Home Office.
I hope you don't mind my approach, but we saw that you'd produced an analysis of the IP Bill on the CaSMa project blog site, and wondered if you might be interested in an informal discussion with officials working on the Bill. This could either be in London, or via phone if that were more convenient.
If you are interested in setting something up please do get in touch.
Best regards
Rebecca

There are a great many ways in which our work may develop in the coming years. However, these will amount to nought if they are not discharged in the context of public consent. It therefore essential that we broaden our knowledge of the public perception of social media and see a fully a frank discuss with academia as being one way of doing this.&amp;quot; 
The meeting took place on March 4th during which CaSMa explained some of our findings regarding the outcomes of our public engagement work on data usage ethics and the NCA explained some of the main challenges they are facing with regards to digital data.

The field trip researchers were highly impressed by the knowledge, experience and commitment of the people they interviewed, while Nottingham proved to be the ideal environment in which to explore the relationship between RRI and public policy making. We're delighted with the feedback we have had from the NUCLEUS team and on behalf of the Stemcity partnership I would like to extend my grateful thanks to all of you who gave up your time to take part in the programme and also to those who worked so hard behind the scenes to make the interviews happen.

The field trip identified a number of common themes emerging from the interviews including:

 Nottingham has a very positive culture of partnership working between its research institutions and public policy makers
 However if RRI partnerships are to realise their potential dedicated management is needed
 Nottingham has an opportunity to be a 'living lab' in order to test bed new RRI approaches

Follow-up conference
In order to interrogate these findings in more detail a follow-up conference will take place on Friday 7th October from 9.30am - 1.30pm at the Council House. Through group workshops and plenary discussion we will explore:

 Strengthening local partnership working
 Developing test beds for new RRI approaches
 The impact of Brexit on UK RRI

Co-hosted by Nottingham City Council and Nottingham Trent University the conference is free to attend and a buffet lunch and refreshments will be provided.
Attendance is not limited to NUCLEUS field trip participants and we welcome registrations from other interested colleagues and partners. However places are limited to 40 so please confirm your attendance as soon as possible.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exploring the Value of Digital Footprints, 12 Nov 2015, Nottingham Business School, Nottingham Trent University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA843342-1991-4D67-8071-AC567073E3DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture on the topic of 'Exploring the Value of Digital Footprints', for Nottingham Business School undergraduate students at Nottingham Trent University taking the Digital Marketing module (12 Nov 2015).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>15th.12.2015 Creative &amp; Cultural Industries RPA sandpit/networking, Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71B3A310-CD02-4965-99BC-A8728A98A6DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ansgar Koene attended this event as part of an exploration of potential future collaborations and/or grant applications</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd.12.2015 Data Driven Discovery RPA sandpit with DeltaRail, Nottingham.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>448DCD20-6010-4203-B95D-011CFD32A84A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A sandpit event organized by the Data Driven Discoveries RPA, in collaboration with the company DeltaRail.

Session 1: Hub presentations and discussion 
CaSMa: Citizen-centric approaches to Social Media Analysis' (Tom Rodden, Nottingham). See separate presentation slides
Points raised in discussion: 
- Suggested that we might look at doing a special issue of a journal on the ethics of social media research - how to negotiate the fine line between overstepping the mark on social media analysis and understanding the true picture as a researcher? The bounds and limits of algorithms need to be explained.
- We need to think about the communication of these issues to the public and the media.
- It was noted that work from Warwick is looking at issues relating to ethics and social media (Peter Elias).

Social Media - Developing Understanding, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Engagement (University of Aberdeen). See separate presentation slides
Points raised in discussion:
- It was suggested that we might look to coordinate or synchronise some of our events across the hubs, and perhaps consider some common branding.
- Linguistic colloquialisms as hash tags - raised interesting questions about regionalisation.
- It was suggested that we think about how we all access data channels such as twitter. Try to get thematics at top level about what we want to see in the data - opinion, rationality
- It was noted that there are two other ESRC-funded projects on Scottish independence that it may be worth linking up with/being aware of, as well as the Future of Scotland in the UK initiative.
- There was discussion around opinion diffusion and the ethics of marketing with social media - how individuals deal with recommendations online and their understanding of these. Issues of trust, fake 'personal' opinions etc.
- With reference to the capacity-building aspects of proposal in relation to ECRs, it was suggested that it will be important to also reach mid-career and senior academics new to these datasets.
- Social media is language-mediated and highly evolving. How do we deal with this? Issues such as sarcasm, irony in use of hash tags and elsewhere, for example.
- New statistics: this work is pushing at the limits of what some social science disciplines understand, e.g., time series analysis.

Social Media Analytics for Social Geography (Ranald Richardson, Newcastle). See separate presentation slides
Points raised in discussion:
- Issues around lobbying a) to get data made available in a central point in the UK (e.g., British Library), and b) for greater personal privacy were discussed.
- There is a need for greater awareness in user groups of what social media data can and cannot do.
- Questions around data ownership were discussed - data is generally privately held. 
- Chris Carlton noted that ESRC will be talking to twitter about access to data.


Session 2: Facilitated brainstorming sessions on key issues (Claire O'Malley, Nottingham)
Topics discussed:
1. Key challenges identified by each hub 
2. Social science issues in common/different/missing across the hubs 
3. Technical infrastructure issues 
4. Stakeholder engagement 

Points raised in discussion:
Key Challenges:
Ethics: recognising that there is a problem.
- Responsible products
- Unintended consequences
- Companies and legal liabilities
- There is a need for a simple set of principles of personal data use for businesses, involving compliance-checking and possibly a kitemark to engender consumer trust.
Methodological issues:
- Different cultures
- Narratives
- Biases
- Epistemology
- Spotting big data issues
- Managing continual 'newness'
- Is human data different to human tissue?
- Issues of mistrust
Data Access and Ownership:
- Data is becoming increasingly valuable
- SM data is not always 'owned'
- What does ownership and licensing mean in this context?
Data Management and Training:
- Training/understanding of use of data?
- Personal nature of SM data
- Are services like UKDS on top of SM data issues? What is their role?
- Should there be a national point for training on these issues?
- Conveying ethical issues in SM data use to students and embedding in courses
- Translating to industry
Representativeness of the data being studied:
- Issues of sampling and selecting the behaviour to be observed discussed.
- Importance of statisticians in giving greater understanding of these issues.
- How does researching social media phenomena change what is being studied?
- Participants as subjects or co-authors?
- Issues of privacy, trust and understanding.

Social Sciences and Technical Issues:
- Sampling issues are key for approaches such as corpus linguistics (which assumes as systematic selection of texts).
- Issues around individuals using social media to 'perform identities' - personal brand management, particularly in platforms like twitter.
- Different demographics' use of different social media platforms.
- The importance of context in understanding, e.g., the impact of mobile vs static use of social media; the goals and set up of the social media platform and their impacts on posts, e.g., facebook vs. linkedin.
- Longevity of data: expectations that data is transient (e.g., snapchat) and right to be forgotten.
- Can we ever get truly informed consent and is withdrawal of consent possible?
- How does online identity affect offline behaviour?
- Qualitative and quantitative issues - geotags/timestamps.
- Relationships between social science theory and data: pluralism, multiple narratives, appropriate claims.
- Need to understand tools to develop progressive values.
- Effort is needed in collecting data - good sampling methods so not 'cherry-picking' data.
- Public views: shaping, cyberbullying, what is twitter etiquette?
- Start reframing technical infrastructure as 'sociotechnical infrastructure'.
- Issues of protection versus technical development.
- Issues of the intelligent customer.
- Vision of toolkit - SPSS++, R?

Stakeholder engagement:
Existing links and future possible partners were explored:
- Social rights groups, e.g., Liberty (existing links via Horizon)
- Census
- Local Authorities who are trying to use social media to broaden engagement - issues of exclusion and empowering the already-empowered.
- Broader public engagement
- Policy Makers (e.g., ICO)
- Question: what should our relationship be with SM platforms such as facebook/twitter/google?

Question: Is there a strategic RC mission around social media data that we can work to?

Wrap up and discussion of next steps (Derek McAuley, Nottingham)

? Possible joint future workshops:
- Engaging with stakeholders such as privacy international and/or local authorities
- Research data management plans for social media: recommendations for researchers/training for peer reviewers. Produce a guide?
- Given that ethical issues were common to all hubs, this seems like a likely topic for us to come together again on. 
? We will plan to schedule meetings 6-9 months in advance
? We will share information on events across the three hubs
? Branding: we will seek further guidance from ESRC on whether/how we might brand our activities as part of the social media research community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Social Media and Ethics, Advanced Research Methods Seminar (G54ARM), 10 Feb 2015, Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training, University of Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9BED20E5-36D8-498F-9858-1F78646201EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Seminar on the topic of 'Social Media and Ethics', for the Horizon Centre for Doctoral Training students taking the Advanced Research Methods Seminar (G54ARM) module (10 Feb 2015).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Privacy, Personality and Flows of Information</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E8C76A0-4836-4890-8FBD-28FC7218DF2B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop conference co-organised by the mandate of the Special Rapporteur for Privacy (SRP) together with Human Rights Watch, Global Freedom of Expression Columbia University, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law Center, The Department of Information Policy &amp;amp; Governance at the University of Malta and Security, Technology &amp;amp; e-Privacy Research Group at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.

Such questions concern researchers, child rights' advocates, and internet governance experts. Yet children's needs and experiences in the digital age are often neglected in high-level debates about global internet provision and governance and children's rights are treated as a minority interest and seen as demanding exceptional treatment from adult society. Further, current debates frequently emphasise the risks children potentially face online and underline their right to protection, but much less attention is gven to children's provision and participation rights online.

The conference will foster an international debate on key issues related to children's and young people's rights in the digital age, including: child and youth participation rights; online opportunities and risks; inequalities and digital exclusion; policy and multi-stakeholder governance; the role of peers and peer culture; participatory research; e-learning, health promotion and creativity in the digital environment; cross-generational dynamics of online engagement.
The conference includes a plenary presentation from Global Kids Online.

Participation in the event helped establish connections for the stakeholder engagement group we needed to build for our future research project, the EPSRC funded UnBias project (EP/N02785X/1) which started in September 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://storify.com/ReadieEU/readie-research-summit-what-drives-europe-s-digita#publicize</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CaSMa presentations at Human Centred Computing Digital Wildfired workshop, Oxford, 28th July, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A260481-D552-4AE7-8B3F-C6BBA80CEFFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking activity to explore potential collaborative work.

They also promise new ways to pool and mobilise society's resources with the potential to address various impending social and environmental crises.

However, to reap these benefits, new thinking is required around the regulation and governance of smart online platforms to ensure balanced interests, and to promote fair and safe forms of participation, particularly relating to the role played by algorithms and data in driving economies of scale.

This policy event will provide a forum to address the following questions:

 What are the challenges and opportunities for public policy of Smart Online Platforms?
 How can we leverage platforms for a more equal, just, and knowledgeable society?
 How can platforms play a role in reducing the social divide and retain hard-won rights and protections?
 What are the challenges and opportunities for existing industries from their disruptive business models?
 How should the regulatory environment change and what new regulatory institutions or instruments may be needed?
 How can these technologies support public objectives and help policy makers deliver solutions at greater scale and of greater impact?
This event is being organised by the Smart Society EU FET project which has been exploring technologies and governance models for the next generation of Smart Platforms. The event will include the launch of the Smart Society Social Charter, and high-profile keynote talks.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://smartplatformcharter.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CSP Forum: Cybersecurity and Privacy innovation forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>350EC67F-2109-4FF4-9E66-F9E7A5B2EF35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking sparked interest in the work CaSMa is doing. common ground was discovered between the CaSMa project and related EU funded projects, e.g. FP7-ICT PRIPARE project (proj. ref. 61061)

Pete Edwards, University of Aberdeen, on 'Social Media - Developing Understanding, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Engagement' 
Ranald Richardson, Newcastle, on 'Social Media Analytics for Social Geography' 

Claire O'Malley, Nottingham, facilitated the brainstorming sessions on key issues:
1. Social science issues in common/different/missing across the hubs 
2. Key challenges identified by each hub 
3. Technical infrastructure issues 
4. Stakeholder engagement 
Plenary report from lead for each session

This event concluded with a final discussion of next steps by Derek McAuley (Nottingham)

This was a great opportunity for Hub members to meet each other, build relationship and connect our work.


Topics discussed:
1. Key challenges identified by each hub 
2. Social science issues in common/different/missing across the hubs 
3. Technical infrastructure issues 
4. Stakeholder engagement 

Points raised in discussion:
Key Challenges:
Ethics: recognising that there is a problem.
- Responsible products
- Unintended consequences
- Companies and legal liabilities
- There is a need for a simple set of principles of personal data use for businesses, involving compliance-checking and possibly a kitemark to engender consumer trust.
Methodological issues:
- Different cultures
- Narratives
- Biases
- Epistemology
- Spotting big data issues
- Managing continual 'newness'
- Is human data different to human tissue?
- Issues of mistrust
Data Access and Ownership:
- Data is becoming increasingly valuable
- SM data is not always 'owned'
- What does ownership and licensing mean in this context?
Data Management and Training:
- Training/understanding of use of data?
- Personal nature of SM data
- Are services like UKDS on top of SM data issues? What is their role?
- Should there be a national point for training on these issues?
- Conveying ethical issues in SM data use to students and embedding in courses
- Translating to industry
Representativeness of the data being studied:
- Issues of sampling and selecting the behaviour to be observed discussed.
- Importance of statisticians in giving greater understanding of these issues.
- How does researching social media phenomena change what is being studied?
- Participants as subjects or co-authors?
- Issues of privacy, trust and understanding.

Social Sciences and Technical Issues:
- Sampling issues are key for approaches such as corpus linguistics (which assumes as systematic selection of texts).
- Issues around individuals using social media to 'perform identities' - personal brand management, particularly in platforms like twitter.
- Different demographics' use of different social media platforms.
- The importance of context in understanding, e.g., the impact of mobile vs static use of social media; the goals and set up of the social media platform and their impacts on posts, e.g., facebook vs. linkedin.
- Longevity of data: expectations that data is transient (e.g., snapchat) and right to be forgotten.
- Can we ever get truly informed consent and is withdrawal of consent possible?
- How does online identity affect offline behaviour?
- Qualitative and quantitative issues - geotags/timestamps.
- Relationships between social science theory and data: pluralism, multiple narratives, appropriate claims.
- Need to understand tools to develop progressive values.
- Effort is needed in collecting data - good sampling methods so not 'cherry-picking' data.
- Public views: shaping, cyberbullying, what is twitter etiquette?
- Start reframing technical infrastructure as 'sociotechnical infrastructure'.
- Issues of protection versus technical development.
- Issues of the intelligent customer.
- Vision of toolkit - SPSS++, R?

Stakeholder engagement:
Existing links and future possible partners were explored:
- Social rights groups, e.g., Liberty (existing links via Horizon)
- Census
- Local Authorities who are trying to use social media to broaden engagement - issues of exclusion and empowering the already-empowered.
- Broader public engagement
- Policy Makers (e.g., ICO)
- Question: what should our relationship be with SM platforms such as facebook/twitter/google?

Question: Is there a strategic RC mission around social media data that we can work to?

Wrap up and discussion of next steps (Derek McAuley, Nottingham)

? Possible joint future workshops:
- Engaging with stakeholders such as privacy international and/or local authorities
- Research data management plans for social media: recommendations for researchers/training for peer reviewers. Produce a guide?
- Given that ethical issues were common to all hubs, this seems like a likely topic for us to come together again on. 
? We will plan to schedule meetings 6-9 months in advance
? We will share information on events across the three hubs
? Branding: we will seek further guidance from ESRC on whether/how we might brand our activities as part of the social media research community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University of Nottingham press release regarding CaSMa Twitter based campaign on personal digital data usage</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DEEBBE8-10C9-4DBD-8B28-027C662D2BEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of a campaign to get data regarding attitudes of the general public on how their data is being used, as well as raising awareness about this issue, Ansgar Koene commences the #AnalyzeMyData Twitter campaign on January 28th 2016 (Data Privacy/Protection Day).

Unless people are given greater powers over their own data, fear of loss of privacy and freedom of agency will result in a loss of trust that will undermine the ability of the UN data revolution to achieve its goals of stimulating development through increased transparency.

The wording of the draft report by the Data Revolution Group includes more references, compared to the initial proposal, to the need to respect people's privacy and take consideration of ethical concerns with big data.

In this workshop we will aim to share knowledge and best practice in order to inform our own and others' practices when working with social media data, with a focus on key areas including privacy, informed consent and risk. The proposed outcome of the workshop includes a new ethical framework with guidelines for best practice in social media research.

During the two-days workshop participants co-constructed a set of ethics guidelines for both researchers and ethics panel members in order to guide research protocols. It was very productive and by the end of the second day we had a set of guidelines and a series of case studies that illustrated the main ethical challenges to be taken into account.

The workshop was part of a project being carried out at the University of Aberdeen called &amp;quot;Social Media Privacy and Risk: Towards More Ethical Research Methodologies&amp;quot;, which is part a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council &amp;quot;Social Media - Developing Understanding, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Engagement (Social Media Enhancement)&amp;quot; (ES/M001628/1).

Special attention was given to the ethics of personal data in both theory and practice and how social medial data (small data) can be accessed and analysed to:

- Understand the ways people use social media and what this means for individuals and society.
- Understand social phenomena and events expressed in social media by drawing upon social media as a critical, and timely, source of information.
- Develop facilities and approaches that are sensitive to the personal nature of human data: Citizen centric approaches.
- Promote responsible innovation in the capture, analysis and use of human data.

The ultimate goal of this workshop was to gather the knowledge needed to develop 'Facilities and tools for Citizen Social Science' and facilitate data access from an ethically sound approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2nd.02.2016 The Rise of Digital Platforms - Opportunities and Threats for UK and European businesses, Executive Briefing Event.

Created in 2008 by several organisations, government representatives and experts, it fosters dialogue and collaboration with the Internet community on public policy for the Internet. Culminating in an annual conference that takes place in a different capital city, EuroDIG 'messages' are prepared and presented to the UN-led Internet Governance Forum.

EuroDIG is supported by a group of institutional partners, namely the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the European Regional At-Large Organization (EURALO), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Federal Office of Communications of Switzerland (OFCOM) and the R&amp;eacute;- seaux IP Europ&amp;eacute;ens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC).

The main aim of EuroDIG is to promote the engagement of Europeans in multistakeholder dialogue in order to share their expertise and best practice and, where possible, identify common ground. This enables EuroDIG to pull together national perspectives and to apply and shape European values and views regarding the Internet.

CaSMa aims to promote social media literacy by informing the general public as well as academics, clinicians and policy makers about Citizen Centred Approaches to Social Media Analyses, a new ethically sound way to access digital human data. 
This was done through the organizing and/or participation in a series of public events, such as the Web We Want festival series; the delivery of CPD (Continuing Professional Development) events for SMEs in Nottingham; organizing and/or participation in events at the Digital Catapult Centre in London; engagement with the civil service via the Social Media Analysis, Review and Innovation network, led by the Food Standards Agency with participation from the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Transport, as well as discussion with member of the Home Office regarding the draft Investigative Powers bill and a meeting with the National Crime Agency regarding popular concerns/attitudes around digital data gathering for criminal investigation purposes; contributing to doctoral training through CDT network seminars; engagement with the academic community via conference, publications and workshops to develop improved guidelines for internet research ethics.
Based on the collaboration with the iRights coalition, insights were gathered regarding the concerns of young people when using the internet, which as currently being analysed and written up for publication and dissemination via the iRights network.
A survey concerning people's attitudes to consent and social media research by academics, government, corporation or third sector organizations is still on-going but has already attracted interest from the National Crime Agency as well as the people at the Flemish Data Supervision Commission.
In the areas of research policy, CaSMa contributed to the updated ethics guidelines for the British Association for Applied Linguistics (BAAL), hosted the 2015 agenda scoping ESRC workshop on social Media research and submitted a research paper reviewing the ethics guidelines documentation of the UK higher education institutions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since CaSMa completion, the EPSRC funded UnBias project (investigating youth understandings of algorithmic bias) has been awarded and has adopted the &amp;quot;Youth Jury&amp;quot; methodologies. UnBias is in collaboration with Oxford and Edinburgh.

The CaSMa project is looking at solutions that put people at the centre of human data by introducing a novel citizen-centred approach to social media analysis. Starting with the acknowledgement that the data relates to human beings with a right to privacy and dignity, CaSMa aims to promote ways 
for individuals to control their data and their desired level of privacy, including mechanisms that make it realistically possible to implement a withdrawal of consent. Indeed, one of the core CaSMa objectives is to ensure that social media users are aware of how their personal data can be used to understand human behaviour and the ethics of handling human data obtained from social media.
Our findings will benefit social media users as well as academics, clinicians and policy makers dealing with digital human data.
Concretely, the contributions that CaSMa made to the new BAAL ethics guidelines will carry forwards into the UK research on Applied Linguistics and the 'youth juries' results will feed directly into the future work by the iRights coalition and its actions for improved protections for young people online.
