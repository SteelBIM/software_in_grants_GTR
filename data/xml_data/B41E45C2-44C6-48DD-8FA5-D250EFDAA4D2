However many details, particularly those concerned with complex variations of speech sound production in words and sentences (or coarticulation), continue to develop during childhood. Previous research by the team has suggested that subtle developmental changes are likely to be found into preadolescence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will focus on these subtle changes, aiming to provide articulatory and acoustic data on the maturation of lingual coarticulatory patterns and tongue differentiation from three years old, when the phonological system of the native language has been mostly acquired, to early adolescence, when adult-like extent of tongue differentiation is present. There will be ten speakers in each of the six age groups, with two years between successive groups. For the first time, the ability to differentiate between parts of the tongue will be systematically studied in tightly spaced age groups throughout childhood, using ultrasound imaging data on tongue position and shape in speech. In addition to established analytical techniques, a new method of comparing tongue curves will be used, which does not require head-to-transducer stabilisation, making it possible to analyse data from three- and five-year-olds.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
- undergraduate, postgraduate and PhD students in speech and language therapy, audiology, general linguistics, speech technology, and other disciplines related to speech and/or human anatomy
- speech and language therapists
- developmental psychologists
- language teachers

How will they benefit?
- University students will learn more about the typical development of speech motor control. The ultrasound and acoustic database will be demonstrated during research information days and at the international symposium, and students will be encouraged to use it for their research projects. Attending oral and poster sessions at the international symposium will also be beneficial for the students.
- Speech and language therapists (SLTs) will be able to use the data on typical articulatory variability as a baseline for assessment. The skills in using ultrasound for analysing speech will be useful for gaining more understanding about the benefits of using visual feedback of tongue movements, even where the technology is not yet available for implementing ultrasound in speech therapy practice.
- Developmental psychologists will further their understanding of how children acquire adult-like speech motor control, and of the limits of variation acceptable for children with non-disordered speech motor skills between 3 and 13 years old, with two-year intervals between age groups.
- It will be of benefit to language teachers to learn how articulatory information from ultrasound tongue images can be used in the school or university classroom for teaching foreign language phonetics and understanding the structure of the native language. A short film made during the project will be available for showing to language students in the classroom.

What will be done to ensure they benefit?
- During the project, we will host two research information days for the project participants, also targeted at university students, speech and language therapists, developmental psychologists and language teachers (see Pathways to Impact for more details). The days will also be open to the general public, and advertised in the speech and language therapist communities and at different universities.
- Two study days for SLTs will be organised at QMU during the project, in collaboration with other research projects currently running in the Clinical Audiology, Speech and Language Research Centre. Additionally, within the two-day international symposium organised at QMU (see Academic Beneficiaries for more details), a satellite workshop on application of ultrasound to clinical practice will be held for SLTs. The workshop will also be organised jointly with colleagues from the CASL Research Centre. During these events, members of the team will demonstrate the use of ultrasound to assess tongue control in children and adults. Results from the project will be presented, and practical ways of implementing our measures in the clinic will be discussed with the participants. 
- A short film will be made about the project, summarising the results and outlining the benefits of the ultrasound technology for speech therapy and language teaching.
- The project mini-website will have a section written in a style accessible to the general public, summarising project aims and outcomes, as well as specific benefits of the ultrasound technology to potential users.
- The outputs of the project will be communicated by publishing in professional magazines (e.g. the Bulletin of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists) and newsletters, special newspapers, and popular magazines read by the general public. As in the past, the Press Office at QMU will provide assistance in contacts with the media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>303763</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation within a discussant session (Glasgow): Development of lingual motor control in children and adolescents</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0ED9F65D-2CE6-4E4D-8994-CAF3C64BB162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This oral presentation within the discussant session on the Phonetics of Child Language (discussant: Prof Mary Beckman), at the 18th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences (10-14 August 2015, Glasgow, UK), was attended by over 50 academics, and generated interesting and challenging questions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Primary school presentation and demonstration</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D3B9F56-4ED3-49F4-8BB9-A1381ADDB001</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Natalia Zharkova took part in a presentation/demonstration to primary school children at Towerbank Primary School in Portobello, Edinburgh, on 1st June 2015, within the Researcher in Residence scheme run by Queen Margaret University.

The meeting took place at the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, and it was attended by over 30 therapists from London and surrounding area.

The presentation, which lasted over two hours, had an interactive format, and it generated a considerable number of questions and discussion points taken up by the therapists themselves (such as the practicalities of introducing ultrasound as a visual biofeedback tool and/or an assessment tool in NHS clinics; using and interpreting quantitative measurements based on the visible tongue contours; factors influencing the value of tongue contour data for taking clinical decisions).

This is an invitation only panel comprised of speech and language therapists, phoneticians, linguists and speech scientists. Members of the panel have worked in over 40 different countries. The panel aims to define international best practice guidelines and to identify practical pathways for improvement of international practices for working with multilingual children who have speech sound disorders. Contributions by the panel have been presented at several international conferences. There are also two international peer-reviewed journal publications co-authored by the panel:
- McLeod, S., Verdon, S., &amp;amp; International Expert Panel on Multilingual Children's Speech (in press). Tutorial: Speech assessment for multilingual children who do not speak the same language(s) as the speech-language pathologist. American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology.

International aspirations for speech-language pathologists' practice with multilingual children with speech sound disorders: Development of a position paper. Journal of Communication Disorders, 46, 375-387.

Through Natalia Zharkova's membership in the Panel, her work on typical motor speech development became known to the London Speech Disorders Special Interest Group, where she was invited in 2014 to give a presentation and demonstration of ultrasound tongue imaging (see a separate entry for the presentation/demonstration, under &amp;quot;Engagement Activities&amp;quot;).

The group met weekly to discuss recent research papers in the field of experimental phonetics and phonology, clinical phonetics and linguistics, theories, models and methodological advances. The members of the group are researchers, PhD students, Masters students and Postgraduate Diploma students. It was mainly attended by people based at Queen Margaret University, but researchers and PhD students from the University of Edinburgh have also expressed interest in attending and/or attended the group.

The group serves as a platform for discussing ideas generated through reading, and such discussions have already led to collaborative work in the CASL Research Centre.

After the presentation of this poster and the questions raised during the conference, discussions among the team led to developing further suggestions for methodological improvements in the quantification of ultrasound tongue contour data recorded without head-to-transducer stabilisation. Such quantification can potentially be used for diagnosing speech motor problems using ultrasound tongue imaging.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have been used to provide education, information and training to speech and language therapists during the grant. Outcomes from the project have been disseminated to wide audiences of speech therapists through three different events that involved regional, national and international audiences: a workshop for clinicians run in collaboration with other researchers at Queen Margaret University as a satellite event after Ultrafest VI international conference in 2013, an invited presentation by Dr Natalia Zharkova at the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in London in 2014 (see http://www.qmu.ac.uk/casl/ChildCoarticulation/slt.htm), and a presentation by Dr Zharkova to around 100 paediatric therapists from the Lothians area of Scotland in 2015. These events focussed on using ultrasound tongue imaging as a research and clinical tool for assessing speech motor control in children with language and speech disorders. Information obtained in the project was used for the demonstrations, particularly the data on lingual coarticulatory patterns with limits of variation acceptable for children between 3 and 13 years old with non-disordered speech motor skills.

Dissemination of the knowledge to speech therapists has also continued through Dr Zharkova's continued membership of the invitation-only International Expert Panel on Multilingual Children's Speech (http://www.csu.edu.au/research/multilingual-speech/iepmcs), which aims to define international best practice guidelines and to identify practical pathways for improvement of international practices for working with multilingual children who have speech sound disorders. The latest publication by the Panel, entitled &amp;quot;Tutorial: Speech assessment for multilingual children who do not speak the same language(s) as the speech-language pathologist&amp;quot; (American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology, in press), cites our work funded by this ESRC grant (Zharkova, Gibbon &amp;amp; Hardcastle, 2015, Clinical Linguistics &amp;amp; Phonetics).

Methods of ultrasound recording and analysing child speech developed by the team have been adopted internationally in studies of delayed and disordered speech development in children. Two of those studies, carried out by different teams based in the United States (McAllister Byun et al., and Frisch et al.), appeared in 2016 in the special issue of Clinical Linguistics &amp;amp; Phonetics, &amp;quot;Insights from ultrasound: Enhancing our understanding of clinical phonetics&amp;quot;, co-edited by Dr Zharkova (see http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/02699206.2016.1139626). Our work has also been increasingly cited in clinically oriented publications by external researchers in international peer-reviewed journals (e.g., American Journal of Speech-Language Pathology; Cleft Palate - Craniofacial Journal; Clinical Linguistics &amp;amp; Phonetics; Disability and Rehabilitation; Ear and Hearing; Journal of Communication Disorders).

Important steps towards directly helping children and adults with speech disorders have been taken through Dr Zharkova's collaborative work with academic and clinical practitioner colleagues in the UK and abroad. This work has already led to her involvement as an international consultant in a four-year research grant on typical and disordered coarticulation in Croatian speech, at the University of Zagreb, running between 2017 and 2021 (Principal Investigator Dr Marko Liker). Dr Zharkova will also act as a consultant on a successful research grant from Action Medical Research on assessment and treatment of speech disorders in children with cleft lip and palate, to start in 2017 at the University of Strathclyde (Principal Investigator Dr Joanne Cleland).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EAD9EE9D-47F5-4922-ADF9-19C3604646C0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was the first study to provide articulatory and acoustic data on the maturation of lingual coarticulatory patterns and tongue differentiation from the age of 3 years old to early adolescence. The database collected in the study is a resource that can be used for addressing various linguistic phonetic questions. The methodology of quantitative ultrasound analysis of lingual coarticulation based on recordings without head-to-transducer stabilisation has been validated, and it has been successfully applied in recordings of young children.

The study has improved methods of analysing lingual articulation, drawing on the results of our earlier ESRC-funded investigations of speech motor control in children. Specifically, during the project a new index for measuring tongue shape was introduced, called LOCa-i. As part of the study, several measures of tongue shape were compared, and this index was found to be the most robust across speech sounds, consistently producing the same results for all consonants tested, regardless of whether the participant's head was stabilised in relation to the ultrasound transducer. The script for calculating LOCa-i index has been made available online.

New knowledge has been generated on lingual coarticulation development in children. The study focussed on the role of articulatory constraints in the development of consonant-specific coarticulation. It was demonstrated that children gradually develop adult-like characteristics, and the extent of variability reduces with increasing age. Segment-specific constraints typical of adult speech were followed to some extent in both younger and older children, though there were age-related differences in consonant-specific coarticulation. All speakers had vowel-related effects on the consonant /p/, which does not involve the tongue as the primary articulator. Lingual consonants however showed progressively more evidence of vowel-on-consonant coarticulation with increasing age, depending on the consonant production requirements. The reduced differentiation between parts of the tongue reported for the 3-year-old participants could account for the lack of certain aspects of vowel-on-consonant influence in that age group. The findings also suggest that up to the age of 11 years old, the goal of producing a perceptually appropriate consonant may limit the extent of vowel-related coarticulation. Some results have been published during the project (e.g., Proceedings of the International Seminar on Speech Production 2014; Clinical Linguistics &amp;amp; Phonetics 2015; Proceedings of the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences 2015), and more international peer-reviewed journal and conference papers are to appear. The outcomes of the study open up new possibilities for us to further investigate speech dynamics in children, building on the project results.

A long-term practical aim of the study was to gain information that would potentially be useful for diagnosing speech motor problems. Through the work on the project and through contacts with external speech and language therapists, it has been established that the methods of collecting and analysing data on lingual articulation that we developed and applied to children's speech have the potential to be used in clinical assessment, because they are suitable for use with young children and other vulnerable populations. These methods are available for future studies involving participants with speech disorders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this project can stimulate more research on the development of typical and disordered speech motor control during childhood, and the recording and analysis techniques can be taken up by other studies, including research grants, and also undergraduate and postgraduate student research projects (there are already some examples, such as a BSc honours project completed at Queen Margaret University in 2015, and a publication by external clinical researchers: McAllister Byun et al., Clinical Linguistics &amp;amp; Phonetics, 2016). Building on the outcomes, applications for clinically oriented funding can be prepared, targeted at analysing tongue movements in children, adolescents and adults with disordered speech.

Additionally, a successful presentation/demonstration event for children held at a local primary school in 2015 (see http://www.qmu.ac.uk/casl/ChildCoarticulation/school.htm for details) shows how children can benefit from engagement with knowledge and technology. The event involved taster sessions with ultrasound and playing videos about applying scientific technologies to speaking, singing and playing musical instruments. The children were genuinely involved in the process and asked for more similar events, and teaching staff were also very enthusiastic. Such events, if held regularly, can contribute to raising children's interest in science as well as languages and music, and broaden their educational experience.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AD57BBF2-AADC-40EC-8935-FD2E1045739A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.qmu.ac.uk/casl/ChildCoarticulation/home.htm</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database consists of acoustic recordings of spoken sentences, synchronised with dynamic ultrasound images of the tongue, with the ultrasound frame rate of 100 Hz.
