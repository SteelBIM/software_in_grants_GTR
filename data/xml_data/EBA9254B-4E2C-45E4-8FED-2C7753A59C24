leading anionic surfactants, currently manufactured in the UK by Croda Europe Ltd. Based on patented Continuous
Oscillating Baffle Reactor (COBR) technology, the project will deliver a new process for the manufacture of existing
products, with significant improvements in operational and capital costs and process sustainability without impacting
product quality. Processes are specifically designed for integration with existing batch manufacturing assets to provide
increased capacity without the need for new supporting infrastructure and extended footprint.
The consortium believes that the 30% targeted reduction in operational costs, combined with reduced capital requirements
will make investment in UK manufacturing a competitive option in a global market. This industry led, four partner
consortium (Croda, CPI, University of Cambridge, Institute for Manufacturing and NiTech) will establish technical and
commercial viability of the concept; de-risking Croda future commercial investment in the proposed technology. The
impact of this strategy to create flexible manufacturing capacity on existing business models will be explored.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PROJECT PARTNERS - Deep engagement with the research outputs will be achieved first and foremost with the project
partners - Croda Europe Ltd, CPI, NiTech and University of Cambridge - through the development of the underpinning
knowledge ideas and innovation, and through the subsequent use and application of new ideas and tools arising from the
project. The project aims to apply a novel technology (COBR) developed by NiTech and commercialise in the chemical
manufacturing sector, and develop an appropriate business model for its market adoption.
INDUSTRY - The University of Cambridge regularly presents in open forums across industry and also runs workshops to
showcase tools for these audiences, ensuring a wide awareness and opportunities to engage with the project insights and
outputs. University of Cambridge has also partnered with non-industry specific forums such as IEMA, KTNs, and the
2Degrees network who have a large and diverse membership and provide an excellent route to broad multi-sector
dissemination. The University of Cambridge also has developed effective methods for dissemination of project outputs,
including through executive education, in-companies training, consultancy licensing as well as the more traditional
academic approaches.

ACADEMIC COMMUNITY - The EPSRC Centre for Industrial sustainability represented in this project by the Institute for
Manufacturing at the University of Cambridge affords a number of pathways to impact. The University of Cambridge (UoC)
will disseminate the research results and knowledge developed in this project to its academic community in the form of
papers, conference presentations, workshops and teaching, whilst sharing the tools and insights with its extensive
industrial network.

UK ECONOMY - This project seeks to defend and grow UK chemical manufacturing through (i) development of new
efficient processes with a lower operating cost base (30% reduction targeted), (ii) ability to compete on price with Chinese
producers (iii) improved product environmental credentials- added value and (iv) ability to bring products to market faster
and develop new future markets. The project will enable industrial demonstration of a novel COBR technology followed by
increased licensing opportunities. The project will de-risk and increase the potential for UK investment- positively
benefiting the local area through the retention of existing job and increasing future employment and local skills
development opportunities. Environmental benefits include lower energy processing, less use of water, removal of process
solvents and hence lower VOC emissions, reduced waste through better process control and reduced equipment cleandown
volumes. Outside of the consortium, the UK benefits from improve environmental emissions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100355</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FlexMan Press Release by NiTech</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3321D1D2-557F-49D5-B8E7-EDE0F962E890</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NiTech Press Release Titled: NITECH WINS MAJOR &amp;gt;&amp;pound;1m INDUSTRY-LED PROJECT

This understanding cannot be built solely from textbooks, papers and laboratories, but is strengthened and deepened by engaging with practice, exchanging with peers and broadening horizons of experience.
In order to support these needs the Centre developed the cohort programme, bringing together students of manufacturing, design and industry with a common interest in sustainability. The cohort development programme is there to support research students from across Centre institutions and from the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (DTC) in Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing, but we have welcomed members from across the UK and the international research community. 
Over the last 5 years, the programme has provided a range of opportunities for researchers to gather and engage in activities to improve their research practice, build networks and expand personal horizons. Events have ranged from research practice - helping understand the tool building process - to communication skills, practicing how to communicate research ideas succinctly to industry. The community has also exploited social media such as Facebook to maintain contact between events and share the latest news and conferences. The cornerstone of the programme is an annual retreat which brings students, researchers, senior academics together to develop shared understanding, and personal vision for their role in the future of manufacturing. In 2016 62 attendees were drawn from 11 UK institutions</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Re-Distributed Manufacturing EPSRC Sandpit</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAA16388-71FB-4AC8-92AE-10908E1384C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussed novel approaches to re-distributed manufacturing, and the relevance of flexible manufacturing to sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.recode-network.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Business Modelling Workshop for FlexMan</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B832261E-D584-4E4F-8555-323620CFB2D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Business Modelling Workshop was conducted at CPI, Sedgefield.
