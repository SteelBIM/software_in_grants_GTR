&lt;p>Research has tended not to focus on this group, largely because they are hard to locate, and even harder to collaborate with in research. In this project we address both these sets of concerns by focusing research effort onto a number of key case study localities in London and by using a range of approaches to address these issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In economic terms the life and functioning of rich neighbourhood spaces appears intuitively important. For example, attractive and safe spaces for captains of industry, senior figures in political and non-government organisations are often regarded as major markers of urban vitality and the foundation of broader social networks that may make-up the broader glue of civic and political society. Yet we know very little about how such neighbourhoods operate, who they attract and how they are linked to other cities and their neighbourhoods globally.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will employ a multi-method research design which will include both the analysis of existing data and detailed case studies of six carefully selected neighbourhoods in and around London.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Taken as a whole we envisage a number of types of research impact and we will need to carefully navigate a social field in which questions of wealth have become more and more socially contentious. 

First, we can see that economic and societal impact may result where policymakers connect with our research findings on the urban needs and choices of very affluent members of the labour market in cities like London. Provisioning for this group is likely to be a divisive and problematic set of issues at this time and we will seek to write for policymakers in ways that engage with these problematics. There are clear difficulties in working within metropolitan contexts in which economic growth and privilege have become difficult spaces to navigate or to engineer. The research will also have a conceptual impact to the extent that it seeks to engage, influence and inform public opinions and insights into the life-world of the affluent and their broader connection to the social life of the city and economy more broadly. This includes questions, and the broader flow of debates, around how we may understand policy choices linked to this group, who this group are, how they fit into the contemporary class schema and flow of urban life more broadly. Finally the impact of the project will also be felt here through the generation of new capacity-building around the development of technical skills and methods in relation to the study of the affluent in the UK and internationally. These skills are significantly under-developed at a time when they are clearly in need. We will assess our impact here by monitoring policy debates and legislative instruments. 

Second, we will engage think tanks and observe their research and related agendas to see whether our work has infiltrated these modes of thinking and communication. We will monitor media reporting of our work and maintain counts of downloads of our working papers and bulletins and final reports. Think tanks concerned with the wider impacts of social inequality and spatial divisions (the potential negative impacts of the super-affluent on city communities and social politics) are very likely to find findings from our work, which link the lifestyles and wider economic role of the wealthy in terms of the broader city, of use. Here we are particularly thinking of findings detailing strategies of residential selection, social closure and political-social beliefs. There has been significant interest in the impacts of inequality and the fiscal implications of austerity since 'the crash'. We see a number of key groups and bodies benefiting from our results given the project's emphasis on placing the rich in a wider urban and social context. More specifically we will engage with the RSA, the JRF, housing charities, the IPPR and so on. Right of centre and market-oriented think tanks will also be likely beneficiaries given their beliefs about the role of the rich as wealth generators and economic catalysts more broadly.

Third, given the significant appetite for research findings that focus on how the rich live, as well as their urban and social positions, we want to engage fully with broader public debates. The research will provide often-unique insights into the worlds of super-rich neighbourhoods in London. The public benefit of this work will be in demystifying and making publicly accessible a series of insights based on empirical data. Debates about social inequality have sharpened recently and seem unlikely to diminish given long-term economic forecasts and austerity measures. In this context there remains a general interest in treatments of social issues focused 'up' the income and class hierarchy. We will create an email update function on the website so that anyone can request to be kept informed of outputs as they arise from the project and will also engage TV and radio outlets, with which we have good relations, such as documentary film-makers and the BBC Great British Class Survey team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>466649</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The research has been disseminated by way of a number of academic journal articles, book chapters, conference presentations (throughout the UK, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong and the USA), blogs (see a list here: https://autotomically.wordpress.com/2016/01/07/charting-the-alpha-territory/), and more accessible shorter pieces in outlets such as The Conversation, Discover Society, Le Monde Diplomatique and OpenDemocracy. We have also produced a Policy Briefing - International Flows of Capital into London Property - distributed by SPERI at the University of Sheffield. We also held an open end of award conference - attracting some 60 attendees - jointly with the III at the LSE (http://www.lse.ac.uk/InternationalInequalities/events/Elites%20conf.aspx) in July 2015. In July 2016 we held a 2 day event within one of our case study sites - held in the Highgate Scientific and Literary Institute - that involved an extensive exhibition about the history of the 'great houses' in Highgate 1914-2014 and a pubic lecture attended by over 100 local residents interested in our work. All written forms of output are detailed here on ResearchFish. 

We have also worked closely with Ramidus Consulting Ltd to produce a report on the specifics of the Westminster super prime housing market - http://transact.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/news/prime_residential_research_report_140722.pdf.

The findings of the research have attracted substantial media interest. We have been interviewed by a number of media organisations including the company responsible for producing the BBC2 series The Super Rich and Us. 
We have worked closely with the Guardian/Observer producing a series of articles that invoked substantial debate. These articles provided important context ahead of the release of The Panama Papers. The first in Dec 2015 - http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/dec/06/battle-rages-for-soul-of-highgate - about elite displacement in Highgate received 983 comments and extensive media follow up my the local press, radio and the Daily Mail. The second in Jan 2016 - http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/jan/23/london-fawning-politicians-welcome-rich -
about the role of politicians in assisting the super-rich to access London property received 416 comments. The third, also in Jan 2016 - http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/jan/30/luxury-london-homes-86m-social-housing - examined our policy ideas for a social housing levy on super prime properties received 596 comments. the most recent piece in March 2016 - http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/12/family-office-private-wealth-funds - looked at the role of family offices in central London and received 417 comments. 

In April 2016 we presented our work at the Rabbit Road Institute to local people in East London -http://createlondon.org/event/why-study-the-rich/- including debating the issues with artists, Aditya Chakrabortty, senior economics commentator for the Guardian and others.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5E96C92C-1BD7-46E5-BD2D-0EB84999DECA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In 2010 some 388 individuals had accumulated the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50 per cent of the global population, by 2012 it was 159, and in 2014 it was just 80. The most recent annual World Wealth Report estimates that there were some 14.6 million, of what they term High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) distributed around the globe in 2014; a figure almost 70 per cent greater than it was in 2008. Of these some 550,000 reside in the UK. Nowhere in Britain has this revival of an ultra-rich elite been more evident than in London; as of 2014, there were 80 individuals with wealth of more than &amp;pound;1 billion resident in London, far and away the city with the greatest number in the world. This is the apex of the 0.5 million or so HNWIs who now reside in London, attracted by the English language, its relative safety, its position as the leading global centre for finance and the unparalleled range of high quality support services, advisers and places of entertainment it provides. 

In a metropolitan area of some 13 million people this number of wealthy elite residents may appear as a drop in the ocean, yet the character and landscape of the city, the tone of its political debates and the nature of its economy have been more deeply captured and re-crafted by the super-rich than numbers alone might indicate.

First, new waves of accumulation among financial and political elites have generated historically unprecedented concentrations of wealth in the new classes of owners and bureaucrats who feel that global regional instabilities make the UK a first-rate asset class for investment in property or financial vehicles operated by its financial heart in the City. The perception of London as a centre of tax and finance stability has helped to channel vast global supplies of capital looking for a safe haven and good prospects for future growth. 

Second, and related, London's property market is seen as one of the safest bets of almost any asset class, often viewed as outperforming gold, the stock market or any other investment vehicle. London's house prices have seen remarkable growth of in the 'prime' and 'super-prime' areas as well as the tiny 'ultra-prime' housing market that has developed to take advantage of this.

Third, the interests of a coalition of the city's governors (political, real estate and finance elites) have conjoined and now seek to prop up their legitimacy by offering a narrative of these changes that puts great emphasis on the need for unfettered controls on property sales, capital and corporate investment. This alliance is increasingly in conflict with a new constituency that ranges from those on low incomes to those on much higher salaries who have seen their own, and often their children's, housing opportunities dismantled by the exorbitant market realities now set in train. 

The study details how these - and other issues - are playing out at a granular neighbourhood level within the wealthiest parts of London.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Some specific issues: 1 : Debates about property taxation, migration and wealth should be informed by knowledge of the city as a non-substitutable space. London is seen as being preferable to most other global city locations for investment and for living. The implications of this are a. property and other tax mechanisms could be pegged at higher levels without seeing a significant loss while benefitting other areas of investment such as low-cost housing and b. political discourse should be re-shaped to reflect these realities in ways that connect to prevailing public concerns about inequality and the capture of suitable contributions from the (global) wealthy to other parts of the economy and city assets, 2 : The use of high end property as a channel for money laundering: it seems extraordinary that in planning applications there is no requirement for the applicant (or even the appellant) to divulge the identity of the beneficial owner of the entity responsible for the application or appeal. 3 : The lack of a national policy on the damage caused to neighbours by the construction of basements ought to be addressed. For example owners of vehicles are required by law to hold third party insurance to indeed to be licenced. Neighbours have no means of redress against people who build basements, either for inconvenience or for damage. Nor is there proper licencing, compensation and monitoring of subsequent damage due to neighbourhood properties other than through the civil courts unlike with vehicles where there are established methods of making claims for damage. 4 : The apparent unenforceability of section 106 agreements in the planning system is a source of considerable annoyance as it seems wholly unfair that legal contracts between local authorities and developers can not be enforced. 5 : Presumption in favour of development - this needs to be much more nuanced, is perhaps wholly appropriate in areas of new build but is not appropriate in inner urban areas, particular those with important heritage assets 6 : The hoarding of under-utilised space in large properties in elite neighbourhoods is incentivised by many different elements of the taxation system and contributes to housing stress and shortage. Thus the prioritisation of stamp duty over a recurring annual charge linked to the full range of house values results in disincentives to sell. The fact that in London single people in houses that are hugely excessive to their needs also contributes to housing shortage through under-occupancy is also an issue. 7 : Questions included in the decennial census almost exclusively cover different manifestations of disadvantage. This makes it very difficult to identity the location and characteristics of elite neighbourhoods and to differentiate different forms of elite neighbourhood.
