Journeys and Experiences</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N013646/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Current policy interventions urgently need assessing in light of unprecedented levels of migration and a catastrophic increase in refugee and migrant deaths across the Mediterranean Sea. While refugee and migrant deaths en route to the European Union are by no means new, the level and intensity of recent tragedies is unprecedented. More than 1850 deaths were recorded January-May 2015, demanding swift action on the part of EU Member States. This project produces a timely and robust evidence base as grounds for informing policy interventions developed under emergency conditions. It does so by assessing the impact of such interventions on those that they affect most directly: refugees and migrants themselves.

As migratory pressures increase across North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, EU leaders have committed to a strengthened presence at sea, while fighting trafficking and smuggling networks, and extending cross-regional cooperation in order to prevent 'illegal migration flows'. Although there remain significant continuities in EU policy, developments in the region have shifted quickly under emergency conditions. Triton, a joint border management operation coordinated by the European external border agency Frontex, replaced the Italian search and rescue operation Mare Nostrum in autumn 2014. Triton's rescue capacities increased in early 2015, alongside a renewed focus on cross-regional migration and development cooperation, such as through the Khartoum and Rabat processes. New EU efforts to disrupt smuggling and trafficking networks in the region have also been initiated through the EUNAVFOR Med naval operation. 

These developments urgently need assessing in terms of their impact on refugee and migrant movements across the region. The EU has emphasised the importance of reinforcing internal solidarity between Member States and fostering shared responsibility through cross-regional cooperation. Nevertheless, such concerns reflect a policy agenda that has thus far had limited success in providing effective protection or settlement outcomes for refugees and migrants crossing the Mediterranean by boat. A renewed assessment of policy interventions is therefore pressing. This project undertakes such an assessment by engaging the journeys and experiences of refugees and migrants, asking: What are the impacts of policy interventions on migratory journeys and experiences across the Mediterranean? How do refugees and migrants negotiate complex and entwined migratory and regulatory dynamics? In what ways can policy be re-shaped to address migrant deaths at sea?

Developments in search and rescue, anti-smuggling, and preventive mechanisms cannot be assessed in isolation from those who are most directly affected by such developments. An approach grounded in the journeys and experiences of refugees and migrants is thus urgent in order to effectively assess the impact of policy interventions across the Mediterranean. The project produces a robust evidence base that explores the effects of policy interventions on refugees and migrants across the region, focusing on three EU island arrival points in Greece, Italy and Malta. Qualitative interview data, both textual and visual, is produced through an interdisciplinary participatory research approach, and made available through the UK Data Service. This data is subject to a timely initial and on-going analysis, and is disseminated through research briefs and reports, project workshops and a conference, a project website, academic journal articles, as well as via various media outlets.

The project contributes: an interdisciplinary perspective on the legal and social implications of policy interventions in the region; a comparative perspective on migratory routes and methods of travel across the Mediterranean; a qualitative analysis of the journeys and experiences of refugees and migrants; and methodological insights into participatory research under emergency conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of this research include:
- EU, NATIONAL AND LOCAL POLICY MAKERS: EU Permanent Representations and JHA Counsellors; the Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs; the EU Commissioner for Migration; European Asylum Support Office; MEPs; UK Home Office; UK All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration; Greek, Italian, Maltese and Member State Home Affairs and Interior Ministries; Office of the President of Malta; Mayoral offices of Kos and Sicily 
- INTERNATIONAL, INTERGOVERNMENTAL, AND GOVERMENTAL AGENCIES: UNHCR; IOM; FRA; Frontex; asylum reception, coastguard, military, and policing authorities; International Maritime Organisation
- NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS: Amnesty International; European Council on Refugees and Exiles; Human Rights Watch; International Rescue Committee; Jesuit Refugee Service; M&amp;eacute;decins Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res; Medical Foundation; Migrant Offshore Aid System; Red Cross; Save the Children 
- CIVIL SOCIETY GROUPS: Refugee and migrant led groups and solidarity networks such as Borderline Sicilia and Kos Solidarity, plus local UK groups
- RESEARCHERS AND INFORMATION NETWORKS: International Centre for Migration Policy Development; Migration Policy Centre; Integrated Regional Information Networks; media and cultural outlets 

The multi-dimensional nature of this project ensures that it will benefit a wide range of non-academic users. Policy-makers will acquire comparative knowledge of the legal and social implications of search and rescue, anti-smuggling, and preventive border security and development mechanisms. Research briefs and reports will be circulated to policy-making communities, along with additional publications and presentations targeted to maximise participation in two local workshops and a final conference in Brussels. International, inter-governmental, and governmental agencies will also benefit from the project by gaining a deeper understanding of the social consequences and the humanitarian and human rights implicatis of search and rescue, policing, and reception practices under emergency conditions. Representatives from these groups will be consulted throughout the project, and will receive publications and invitations to project events. NGOs will have an independent and comparative evidence source documenting the journeys and experiences of refugees and migrants, and will be targeted for impact through consultation, project events, and publications. Civil society groups will benefit from having opportunities to share views, challenge skewed or misinformation, and highlight concerns related to the situation of refugees and migrants. The project will maximise the impact of the research on this group through workshop participation, forum engagement, consultation processes, as well as publications and wider dissemination mechanisms. Researchers and information networks will also benefit from the contributions of the project to debates about policy effects, migration and border dynamics, and participatory methodologies. The outputs of this project will be widely circulated through email lists and social media, as well as through project events. University of Warwick Press Office will organise press releases and the dataset will be accessible via the UK Data Service.

Involving beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries throughout all stages of the research process is integral to the impact of this project, which will:
- Invite diverse beneficiaries to review the research (research design, data collection, review, and analysis) 
- Consult an Advisory Board of practitioners, researchers, and activists (research design, data collection, analysis, review, and dissemination)
- Ensure timely publication of initial findings via briefs and reports, with accessible feedback mechanisms via workshops and website forums (review and dissemination)
The project team will mobilise its extensive networks across the EU and Mediterranean to maximise impact throughout the research process</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>254769</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Who are we' Tate Exchange Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>69AE86A9-4229-4503-BB71-187CCC388458</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition at Tate Modern: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/workshop/tate-exchange/who-are-we</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Setting up of space and provisions in Tate Modern in March 2017.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of digital on-line map to complement existing artistic exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Waterloo</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Migratory Experiences Across the Mediterranean, Middle East and North Africa: Negotiating Policy Effects (PI with Professor Suzan Ilcan, University of Waterloo International Partnership Grant)</gtr:description><gtr:id>2588D73F-B59F-4D28-808E-71ED3E0DE907</gtr:id><gtr:impact>University of Waterloo International Partnership Grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint application, preparation for second workshop in Waterloo in September 2018.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Joint application, preparation for first workshop at Warwick to be held April 2017.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Counterpoints Arts</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Who are we' Tate Exchange Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0BCCC2F-26F4-4B84-ACD4-854E5E16620C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition at Tate Modern: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/workshop/tate-exchange/who-are-we</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Setting up of space and provisions in Tate Modern in March 2017.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of digital on-line map to complement existing artistic exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Loughborough University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>'Who are we' Tate Exchange Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>539E8547-5B4C-4B09-9F96-CC53E6DEACA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition at Tate Modern: http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/workshop/tate-exchange/who-are-we</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Setting up of space and provisions in Tate Modern in March 2017.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provision of digital on-line map to complement existing artistic exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article on openDemocracy: Fleeing Europe?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51FFD9AC-FE28-4806-83A4-2E5754DFAEFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Vicki Squire and Vasiliki Touhouliotis published a piece on the adverse effects of the EU's deterrence agenda on openDemocracy.

Documentary film written and directed by Simon Parker, followed by a panel discussion with Dr Simon Parker (University of York), Dr Myria Georgiou (LSE), and Dr Vicki Squire (University of Warwick).
UK 2016 (33 minutes)
Set on location in Libya, Italy and Greece during 2015-2016 at the height of the Mediterranean migration crisis, Precarious Trajectories focuses on the perilous sea crossings that hundreds of thousands of refugees have undertaken in recent years in order to arrive at what they hope will be the safer shores of Europe through the eyes of Ruha from Syria and Ahmed from Somalia.
The tragic loss of life off the coast of Lampedusa in October 2013 in a series of shipwrecks forced the Italian government to launch a more effective search and rescue operation 'Mare Nostrum'. The film explores how when that operation came to an end the death toll rose ten times during 'Black April' in 2015 and subsequently how the European Union with the introduction of Operation Triton and Operation Sofia sought to prioritise anti-smuggling and border controls over humanitarian rescue.
The documentary concludes by showing how Angela Merkel's 'refugees welcome' policy and the more humanitarian response of Mayor Leoluca Orlando of Palermo came into conflict with a hostile counter-response by the heads of Europe's governments as messages of solidarity gave way to razor wire, riot police and the building of 'hotspot' detention camps for an increasingly forgotten and desperate people.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/precarious-trajectories-voices-from-the-mediterranean-migration-crisis-tickets-31091460395#</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reflections on European Border Security and the '2015 Mediterranean Migration Crisis' (Nick Vaughan-Williams)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>297A1F58-9FFF-4CB7-BA49-D36FEE7BF12C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Drawing on his recent book Europe's Border Crisis (Oxford University Press, 2015) and fieldwork conducted in Malta as part of the ESRC Urgency Grant, Professor Vaughan-Williams delivered a keynote lecture on the '2015 Mediterranean migration crisis' at the Northwestern University-LSE symposium on 'The Ethics of Mediation', hosted by the Department of Media and Communications, LSE.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentations at the Annual Convention of the International Studies Association, Atlanta</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DDE47ABB-D4E6-4EF9-8F62-2BD4E285A7FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team presented on 5 panels during the Annual Convention, speaking primarily to an international audience of researchers and postgraduate students.

Questionnaires aimed at measuring impact were distributed among participants, and showed a positive evaluation of the event in terms of it providing novel information and changing participants' views of the topic. As the event took place only three weeks ago, it is too early to provide comprehensive information on its impact over time. 
In the short run, the event resulted in several follow-up contacts, including a query by the Financial Times for information on project findings in Greece and a request by ECRE for more detailed data on findings pertaining to family reunification, both of which the project team provided. In addition, the event resulted in a follow-up meeting with representatives from IOM in early March.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/irs/crossingthemed/output/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the Commonwealth People's Forum in Malta (Maria Pisani)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9DDDA710-D78D-4B93-8C96-26293F4DD39B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Maria Pisani spoke on a panel on migration and resilience at the Commonwealth People's Forum in Malta.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article on the Conversation: Welcome to City Plaza, Athens: a new approach to housing refugees</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1711385E-C6AA-4BA0-BF5B-FE0B7BC51982</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Vicki Squire was approached with a request to republished her openDemocracy article on City Plaza in Athens on the Conversation.

Dr Vicki Squire was invited as a speaker to an APPG hearing, attended by MPs and HOL from various parties who are involved in policy formation in the field of migration. The research has been positively received a range of stakeholders, including the European Commission, various Embassies, NGOs and journalists (through our project event and related outreach activities, and through direct engagement with various stakeholders on the basis of sharing resarch findings). The research team was granted a private audience with Her Excellency Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, President of Malta, which will be followed by another meeting of the same format on 23 May 2017. As a result of this relationship the team will hold an event in Malta on 25 May 2017. In addition, the written evidence that the research team submitted to the Home Affairs Select Committee has been cited twice in the Committee's report on the Migration Crisis, and the evidence submitted to the House of Lords European Union Committee is cited three times in its report on Children in Crisis. The research team has been informed by Mr Olivier Bergeau, Member of Cabinet of European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship, Dimitris Avramopoulos, that the project's evidence brief was received with thanks and was circulated further by the Cabinet. Specific findings pertaining to family reunification have been provided on request to ECRE, which have informed the NGO's positioning vis-a-vis policy changes across EU member states. The research team has engaged with television and print media, and presented research findings not only during formal project events in Brussels and Athens, but also in direct discussions with various beneficiaries (including IOM, Amnesty International, European Commission representatives, and the President of Malta), and in presentations at the European Humanitarian Roundtable, the Commonwealth People's Forum, UN and UNICEF association meetings. Research findings were also shared in lectures and debates at universities and conferences in the UK, Belgium, the US, Canada, Finland, Germany, and Poland. Findings have fed into a symposium and collaborative installation at the Tate Modern, where an interactive map has generated engagement by artists and the general public. The team has produced short blog posts for the project website, as well as commentaries that were published by The Conversation, openDemocracy, the Green European Journal, the Berghahn Focaalblog, and the Who are We? Tate Exchange Project, which have been widely read and republished across various platforms.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4D383F93-2686-4F35-9203-04D4396C922A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>At month 19 out of 24 we can now report on the first and the second phases of our research. The first research phase was based on in-depth, narrative interviews, which were conducted in Sicily, Kos, and Malta between September and November 2015. The second phase was completed May-July 2016 and involved in-depth interviews in Athens, Istanbul, Rome, and Berlin. The four main achievements and findings to date include: (1) the compilation of a database of qualitative interview and observational data by the research team, based on ethnographic work and in-depth interviews with migrants and refugees across seven arrival / transit points along the central and eastern Mediterranean migratory routes; (2) the development of a collaborative research network, including diverse beneficiaries with various stakeholders (policy-making communities, NGOs, artists and community groups); (3) the production of a body of diverse research outputs for a range of different audiences, including non-academic publications and blogs, policy evidence and summaries of findings, two evidence briefings, and academic journal articles; (4) the production of an online interactive story map of 20 stories, previewed by audiences in Tate Modern in March 2017 and to be publically launched in May 2017; (5) the presentation of a comprehensive set of policy suggestions based on the research findings to policymakers and stakeholders in Brussels in February 2016 and in Athens in November 2016, also circulated widely in the form of two evidence briefings. The briefings include key findings and policy suggestions pertaining to both immediate and long-term considerations. Regarding immediate policy changes, recommendations relate to rights-based information campaigns on admission and asylum processes, improvements of reception conditions and facilities at all arrival points across the EU, and the opening of safe and legal routes to the EU. Long-term recommendations regard the need to replace deterrent measures by interventions that improve livelihoods and educational opportunities across source, neighbouring, and transit regions, as well as a need to reject the categories of 'forced' and 'voluntary' displacement in favour of diversified categories of protection that are based on a deeper appreciation of international refugee and human rights law. The findings of the project will be launched as a final report in May 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project is still underway, currently standing at month 19 of 24. In spite of this, significant impacts aimed at the short and medium term have already been made. UK policy makers were briefed on project findings through a presentation at the APPG for Social Science and Policy, and the submission of written evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee, Select Committee on the European Union, and the House of Lords' EU Home Affairs Sub-Committee. Evidence from the project has been cited twice in a report on the Migration Crisis by the Home Affairs Select Committee, and three times in the House of Lords European Union Committee report on Children in Crisis. Research findings were presented to the President of Malta, Her Excellency Marie Louise Coleiro Preca, in a closed meeting at Warwick University. Findings were also presented to EU policymakers, practitioners from EU agencies, NGO representatives, civil society groups, researchers in academia and think tanks, and media representatives at project events in Brussels and Athens, which resulted in follow-up contacts and cooperation with diverse beneficiaries. Additional events inviting a range of policy-makers and stakeholders will be held in Brussels (4 May 2017) and Malta (25 May 2017), with the final report and online map formally launched at the Brussels event. The online map has been previewed by the general public as part of an art installation and symposium co-organised by the PI at Tate Modern (14-16 March 2017). Findings have already been circulated through two evidence briefings, which was sent to local, national, and EU policymakers, EU agencies, NGOs, international organisations, civil society groups, think tanks, and media outlets. In addition, the research team shared findings and information directly with national and international journalists, including from the Financial Times, Sky News, ITV Central, Voice of Islam radio station, TRT Istanbul, Jyllelands-Posten, Kontra News, KosNews24, and real.gr. Stories produced by the project and presented via an interactive map have already been used collaboratively by artists forming part of the Counterpoints Arts projects. The research team have published five commentaries in the Conversation and five pieces on openDemocracy, presenting research findings in accessible language to the general public and the media, and blog posts appeared on the FocaalBlog, the Green European Journal, as well as on the project website. Findings from this research have already informed forthcoming journal article publications in Politics, and Women's Studies Quarterly. One article has been submitted to Millennium, and three further journal articles will be submitted to leading journals in the field of migration studies, European law and politics by May 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C987B5C4-43F8-4372-90E6-E9C5364966DF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/irs/crossingthemed/output/evidence_paper.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Crossing the Mediterranean Sea by Boat: Evidence Briefing 2 (Squire, V., A.Dimitriadis, N.
