Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M021475/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Emerging adulthood', the phase of the life course between adolescence and full-fledged adulthood, is when young people transition to independence as they leave home and make their own way in the world; a vulnerable, pluripotent time that can be a 'tipping point' for life-long mental health problems. We will bring together genetic and genomic strategies in order to establish the genetic, environmental and developmental origins of cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood.

Our sample is unique, consisting of members of twin pairs who have been assessed longitudinally since infancy as part of the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS), which has been continuously funded by MRC programme grants (G0901245, G0500079, G9424799) since 1995. This is the largest ever in-depth longitudinal twin study. The twin design can disentangle genetic from purely environmental influences, and the infancy-through-adolescence data, including genome-wide genotypes, offer a developmental framework that can identify behavioural, genetic and environmental risk/protective factors that predict good vs poor outcomes in emerging adulthood.

Our proposed research has two objectives: 

Objective 1. Identify behavioural, genetic and environmental risk/protective factors that predict good vs poor outcomes in emerging adulthood. We will assess a UK-representative sample of 10,000 TEDS twins (5,000 pairs) at age 21 on a broad battery of cognitive functioning (e.g., literacy and numeracy), mental health (e.g., anxiety and well-being) and environmental measures (e.g., emotional support and life events) comparable to the batteries used in our previous 20 years of assessment, as well as new measures specific to emerging adulthood. This will allow us to bring the longitudinal, genetically sensitive dataset of TEDS to bear on cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood in the context of normal development. We will also conduct genomic analyses using genome-wide genotyping of millions of DNA markers for 5,000 unrelated participants (one member of a twin pair) and for 2,500 non-identical twins of these individuals; these resources will enable cutting-edge genomic analyses based on DNA alone. 

Objective 2. Identify predictors of good vs poor outcomes for individuals of low IQ in emerging adulthood. Diagnosed intellectual disability (&amp;lt;70 IQ) has received much attention in recent molecular genetics research, but little is known about low IQ (70-79 IQ), which is ten times more common and which also results in major personal and societal costs, especially during the tipping point of emerging adulthood in an increasingly technological world. For Objective 2, we will investigate the problems faced by young adults who are challenged cognitively as they make their own way in the world. Our work will yield the first genetically sensitive study of the effects of low IQ on adjustment in emerging adulthood, by assessing in person 600 TEDS individuals with 70-79 IQ scores at age 21 (members of 400 twin pairs with at least one low-IQ proband), co-twins from discordant pairs, and 200 controls. We will conduct intensive in-person interviews focused on the adaptive functioning and adjustment of these low-IQ individuals and their co-twins as they begin to make their way in a cognitively taxing adult world. Their outcomes will be compared to a representative control sample of 200 TEDS individuals assessed in the same way. In addition to describing outcomes for individuals with low IQ as they emerge into adulthood, we will use the twin design comparing identical and non-identical twins to investigate, for the first time, the genetic and environmental origins of these outcomes of low IQ. 

Identifying the genetic and environmental origins of cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood and tracing their developmental roots is a fundamental step towards predicting and preventing these problems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This proposed 2015-20 extension of the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) will apply its powerful design and dataset to 'emerging adulthood', a developmental era about which little is known even though it is a tipping point for life-long personal, social and societal problems. 

For Objective 1, we will study 10,000 TEDS twins (5,000 pairs) after age 21 using online assessment, an approach pioneered by TEDS. We will estimate genetic and environmental sources of variance and covariance applying state-of-the-art quantitative genetic techniques, both the classic MZ-DZ twin design and a new quantitative genetic technique, Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA). GCTA and other genomic analyses, most notably genome-wide polygenic scores, will capitalise on genome-wide genotypes obtained in TEDS for 5,000 unrelated individuals and for 2,500 DZ co-twins, which provide within-family control. Comparisons between twin and GCTA analyses of variance are uniquely informative about the genetic architecture of complex traits and common disorders. Multivariate twin and GCTA analyses will test hypotheses about development, multivariate links between disorders and dimensions, and genotype-environment interaction and correlation and identify developmental, genetic and environmental predictors of outcomes at age 21.

For Objective 2, we will assess in person 600 TEDS twins with 70-79 IQ scores at age 21 (members of 400 twin pairs with at least one low-IQ proband), co-twins from discordant pairs, and 200 controls, focusing on their functional capabilities and adjustment. We will use DF extremes analysis to understand the extent to which functional impairment and adjustment of this group reflects genetic or environmental influences of low IQ. We aim to identify behavioural, genetic and environmental risk factors that predict differential functioning of this vulnerable group of emerging adults who are challenged cognitively.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? Because cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood have far-reaching and long-lasting impact, the proposed research has a broad range of potential beneficiaries, including parents, clinicians, educators, policy-makers, and the wider public, in addition to academics. 

How will they benefit from this research? Seven examples follow, with details including deliverables and metrics of success provided in Pathways to Impact.

Impact 1: Constructing polygenic scores to predict cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood. An exciting prospect for predicting cognitive (e.g., literacy and numeracy) and mental health problems (e.g., anxiety/depression and drug use) in emerging adulthood is the aggregation of the associations of many genes in polygenic scores. These polygenic scores will enable more powerful research to develop personalised treatments, preventive interventions, improved diagnosis, and research on causal mechanisms. Co-Investigator, Dr Gerome Breen, who leads Genomics and Biomarkers for the IoPPN NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, will help us exploit the translational impact of our genomic research.

Impact 2: Improving the prediction of cognitive and mental health problems in emerging adulthood from behaviour and environment in earlier development. The TEDS resource of 20 years of behavioural and environmental assessments will make it possible to improve polygenic predictors of genetic risk by identifying behavioural and environmental risk and protective factors, controlling for genetic risk and considering moderators. Co-Investigator Professor Emily Simonoff, Head of the IoPPN Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Department, will help us exploit the impact of our research on clinicians and policymakers. 

Impact 3: Identifying the adaptive functioning of low-IQ in emerging adulthood.
Intellectual disability is diagnosed on the basis of IQ &amp;lt;70 and low adaptive skills. We will investigate the adaptive skills of people with IQ 70-79 in order to identify the most meaningful criteria for services.

Impact 4: Documenting the societal costs of low IQ in emerging adulthood. New Co-Investigator, Professor Paul McCrone, Deputy Director of the IoPPN Centre for the Economics of Mental and Physical Health, will help us document the economic costs attributable to low IQ and to identify key drivers of these costs that may be modified through educational, health and social care interventions. This research could lead to changes in educational and health policy such as more targeted and cost-effective interventions.

Impact 5: Assessing attitudes towards the use of polygenic scores to predict cognitive and mental health problems. Consultant Dr Saskia Sanderson will help us investigate the views of TEDS twins and their parents on the use of personalised polygenic risk scores for cognitive and mental health problems. This will shed light on how to communicate the complexities of personalised polygenic scores, important first steps in translating genomic research into benefit, practice and policy. 

Impact 6: TEDS as a resource. More than 100 collaborators are actively conducting research using the TEDS resource. We will continue to foster these collaborations in order to leverage the impact of the TEDS programme of research and as capacity-building for UK research.

Impact 7: TEDS as an opportunity for training. TEDS has helped to train a new generation of behavioural geneticists in the UK, with 12 former TEDS PhD students now in academic posts at UK universities. Capacity-building through training at both the PhD and postdoctoral level will continue to be a priority.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2137490</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Colorado</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>CATSLife</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F36F517-8AEF-496B-BF29-9D68454129C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PMC4967849</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The resulting Colorado Adoption/Twin Study of Lifespan behavioral development and cognitive aging (CATSLife) will be the first prospective longitudinal study of the etiologies of behavioral and cognitive changes during the transition to middle adulthood. The aims are to: conduct a genetically sensitive study of individual differences in behavioral and cognitive change at the cusp of middle adulthood, in 1600 participants studied almost yearly from birth to early adulthood; map individual differences in growth and maintenance of cognitive abilities; evaluate and trace measured physical factors and health behaviors, biochemical markers and measured genetic pathways important to sustaining cognitive performance; and track measured environmental factors that may decrease, sustain or boost cognitive performance. The CATSLife will include expanded assessment of cognitive performance, physical functioning and health behaviors, gene pathways, including measured genetic variation in lipid, synaptic plasticity and cell-signaling paths (based on chip array variants), biochemical markers (e.g., serum lipids), and environmental measures (e.g., engagement in leisure activities). We will assess etiologies of changes in physical health and cognitive functioning, and test whether associations across domains change with age due to changes in genetic variation or self-selection of environments. Measured gene pathway sets, and environmental measures, including engagement in leisure activities and neighborhood-level variables, will be evaluated as potential factors underlying dynamics of genetic variation or environmental selection. Thus, the CATSLife will provide an unparalleled opportunity to assess prospectively the etiologies of cognitive change, and test the saliency of early childhood versus proximal influences on the genesis of cognitive decline.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Will assist with the many CATSLife analyses that emerge from the extension of CAP and LTS into early adulthood. However, the primary focus of the analyses will be to replicate CATSLife results using the TEDS longitudinal dataset on 7500 pairs of twins, which includes many of the mediators and moderators assessed in CAP and LTS in emerging adulthood, although not to the upper end of the age-span in CATSLife and without as much data on physical health as in CATSLife. Attempts will also be made to conduct combined adoption/twin analyses of CATSLife, LTS and TEDS when possible. Finally, TEDS has&amp;nbsp;genome wide genotype data for nearly 6000 unrelated TEDS participants, which will enable SNP-based genetic analyses of variance and covariance and polygenic score analyses &amp;nbsp;between DNA markers and measures, mediators and moderators relevant to the proposed CATSLife project.&amp;nbsp;</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Amsterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Consortium on the Genetics of High Cognitive Abilities (GHCA)</gtr:description><gtr:id>F17EE585-9F2C-4FBF-B242-62D5EBE5638C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The following publications have arisen from this study so far: PMID19488046; PMID19381794; PMID19247827; PMID: 19430899; PMID: 19424784; PMID: 19288254; PMID: 19377873; PMID: 19377874; PMID: 19418212; PMID: 19296213; PMID: 19377870.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborator is a GHCA member and is an expert on the genetics of cognitive abilitites and has obtained cognitive ability data that will be used in the study.Collaborator is a GHCA member and is an expert on the genetics of cognitive abilitites and has obtained cognitive ability data that will be used in the study.Collaborator is a GHCA member and is an expert on the genetics of cognitive ability abilitites and has obtained cognitive ability data that will be used in the study.Collaborator is a member of the GHCA consortium and is an expert on the genetics of cognitive ability.

This network will elaborate on the EArly Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) consortium, a well-established collaboration of the many European birth and adolescent population based (twin and family) cohorts with unique longitudinal information on lifestyle, family environment, health, and emotional and behavioral problems. Phenotypic and genome-wide genotypic data are available for over 60,000 children, in addition to genome-wide genotypes for over 20,000 mothers and epigenome-wide data for over 6,000 children. Combined with the enormous progress in methodology, the results of the research performed in this network will greatly expand our knowledge regarding the etiology of mental health symptoms in children and adolescents and shed light on possible targets for prevention and intervention, e.g. by drug target validation. Moreover, it will provide Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) with an excellent training in the psychiatric genomics field given by a multidisciplinary team of eminent scientists from the academic and non-academic sector highly experienced in e.g., gene-environment interaction and covariation analyses, (epi)genome-wide association studies, Mendelian Randomization (MR) and polygenic analyses.
