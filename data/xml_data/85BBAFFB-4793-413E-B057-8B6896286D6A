Waugh</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003933/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh (CWEW) will revolutionise Waugh studies, and influence twentieth-century literary and cultural studies more broadly, publishing a vast storehouse of historical and literary documentation. CWEW will greatly expand our knowledge of the range and complexity of Waugh's thinking and artistic practice, linking this to the work of his contemporaries 1903-66 in Britain, America and Europe. No other edition of a British novelist has been undertaken on this scale. About 85% of Waugh's letters are unpublished. CWEW will print all Waugh's extant writings and graphic art: novels, biographies, travel writing, shorter fiction, essays, articles, reportage, reviews, letters, diaries, poems, juvenilia, parerga, drawings and designs in 42 volumes.
 
There has never been a scholarly edition of Waugh's work, the best volumes being Penguin's Modern Classics reissues. These, however, fall far short of rigorous scholarly standards. It was not Penguin's remit to finance large-scale textual scholarship and the editors were hampered by commercial restrictions. The historical context is meagre. Over the last thirty years, Waugh scholarship has made huge strides. Very little of this scholarship, however, has informed editions of Waugh's work. CWEW aims to correct that. Its editors can quote extensively and without charge from Waugh copyright material, a privilege never before available and which now unlocks a hoard of literary treasures.
 
The objective is thoroughly to historicize each text, to provide an authoritative repository of primary source material in an edition that will not 'date' and that will become the seminal source of reference for the foreseeable future. Through this, we hope not only to transform Waugh studies but also studies of his literary circle (e.g. John Betjeman, Robert Byron, Henry Green, Graham Greene, the Sitwells, Anthony Powell, and Muriel Spark), and to enhance studies of Architecture, Art History, History, Film, and textual editing. Volumes will, for example, investigate British, American and French Catholicism, the impact of both world wars, class, politics and Modernist aesthetics in the twentieth century.

Print publication was contracted in 2009, the project initiated by Alexander Waugh, Waugh's grandson, who curates the massive Evelyn Waugh Archive. OUP and Alexander Waugh will digitize the letters, diaries, essays, articles and reviews in this archive and all copy-texts for a database available to editors through password-protected access from an interactive website which will include: updated bibliographies, blog space for editors, and an open forum for public engagement inviting information on untraced Waugh material and feedback from the project's many public events. These events, launched by a Colloquium (2013) and International Conference (2015), involve our Project Partners: the Bodleian, British, and Brotherton Libraries, the Humanities Research Center (Texas), the University of Milan, the Waugh Estate and OUP. The website, a unique research tool, will expedite research and offer a world-leading forum for Waugh studies. Since 2009, scholarly development has been led by Martin Stannard and David Bradshaw. As Co-Executive Editor (PI) with Prof. Bradshaw (CI), Prof. Stannard will be project manager in collaboration with Alexander Waugh, the General Editor. Publication will be in two tranches: 2016-17, and 2018-22, eleven volumes of Tranche 1 to appear by Easter 2016 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Waugh's death.

The project will fully integrate the career development of a Research Assistant and two doctoral students. All will attend quarterly meetings of the Editorial Board, present annual progress reports to it, and produce conference papers and publications. As crucial figures, they will directly engage with the project's research infrastructure. A dedicated project research area will be created for them in the University of Leicester Library.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

Beyond the academic community, the short-term impact of CWEW will be widespread. Waugh remains a popular author, and film and TV adaptations of novels such as Vile Bodies, Brideshead Revisited and the Sword of Honour trilogy have maintained his high profile. He is widely studied at GCSE and A level. OUP will vigorously market the edition, to be launched with a Press conference at the Colloquium. Eleven Tranche 1 volumes will be released to coincide with media coverage of the 50th anniversary of Waugh's death. When early editions of the Diaries and Letters appeared, they created a Press furore. The many new letters and the unexpurgated diaries are likely to receive similar coverage. OUP will probably serialise the Personal Writings, and Alexander Waugh and the PI will write related Press articles. There will also be annual podcasts by a professional journalist and numerous public events:

(a) book and MS exhibitions at the HRC, Texas (2016), the Brotherton (2016), the British Library (2017), the Bodleian (2017), and the University of Milan (2018);

(b) study days for school students at the British Library and the University of Leicester (2016);

(c) panel discussions at these events and at literary festivals, involving Alexander Waugh and members of the Editorial Board (2016-18).
 
An exhibition of rare books, furniture and manuscripts owned by the Waugh family is planned. Philip Dodd and Simon Hollis of Brook Lapping (one of the larger TV/radio independents) are very interested in making a programme to be broadcast on the 50th anniversary. Twitter and Facebook links on the website will advertise events, inviting feedback and archiving it. The Colloquium (July 2013) and International Conference (April 2015) will both be open to the public. These, and events at the 2016 Literary Leicester festival (free and open to the public), and at the Leicester Literary and Philosophical Society (2015), will lay the foundations for an international impact strategy.

CWEW provides an accessible, comprehensive repository of all known data on each text. Long-term commercial users will include anyone wanting to make a public statement about Waugh's life or work: film makers, adaptors, radio and news producers, curators et al. The long-term use of the edition by the wider public is also likely to be wide-ranging given Waugh's popular appeal.

How will they benefit?

Massive benefits to the cultural capital of the nation accrue from an edition of this size and quality. It will confirm Waugh's status as a major author alongside, say, Dickens and Hardy, enhancing GB's status as one of the world's centres of literary excellence, improving our historical knowledge and understanding of what it meant to be Catholic and British in the twentieth century, of the cultural impact of both world wars, of class, the fine arts, and politics during Waugh's lifetime, particularly through the unearthing of huge amounts of previously unpublished material. School students' interest will be quickened by discussions of MSS relating to their syllabus texts on study days. Apart from the intellectual benefits, however, there are distinct financial ones, too. A project of this scope creates additional or continued employment in the publishing industry, encourages overseas research students, even tourism through the exhibitions and general high-profile publicity.

Relevance to these benefiaries. 

It will improve the nation's wealth and culture, and foster its global economic performance through OUP's international distribution and production network. The timescales for these benefits are those of the two tranches: 2016-2017 for Tranche 1, and 2022 for the completion of Tranche 2, although 2018 for most of it. Thereafter, the effects should continue indefinitely in that the edition is designed not to 'date' and the post-project website will provide a permanent resource for international Waugh studies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>822481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Waugh Day: Alexander Waugh and Alexander Masters in conversation with Martin Stannard</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF7F4F34-C179-4FA5-8D73-41DD39ACEB1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of a day of activities commemorating the 50th anniversary of Evelyn Waugh's death, Prof Stannard chaired a discussion with Alexander Waugh and Alexander Masters - all of whom draw on personal writings in their work. The discussion highlighted the large amount of previously unpublished writings (particularly letters) involved in the Waugh project, and considered the implications of its use. Audience members thoroughly enjoyed the event, with one research student writing that 'It has given me further insight into the process of writing and I might use some of these tips to help me finish my PhD thesis', and another respondent stating that 'I will take away a much better, more rounded understanding/interest of biographies, letters and diaries and stories of the individuals'. Again, there was a strong interest in reading more Waugh across the audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to Bexley Grammar School</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D2A2DA4-57A5-40B0-8EAE-0FDBB92AFDF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>School visit by Dr. Barbara Cooke to 12 members of the 'We Love English' group to talk about Vile Bodies and careers in academia.

A second group has been launched in collaboration with a local independent coffee shop to provide new readers with the chance to begin again at the beginning. Meetings are held monthly in Leicester with approx. 12 core members, with more contributing comments to our blog write-ups. Our aim is to provide a depth of engagement with Waugh not possible in one-off events, and members frequently report both an enriched understanding of Waugh and changes in the way they read altogether: &amp;quot;This has been my first experience of reading for discussion rather than pure pleasure. It's been surprisingly pleasurable taking days analysing the story contents and scenarios rather than racing through the book to discover 'what happens next'.

Stannard's archival enquiries revealed new art work relating to Waugh, a file of D'Arcy correspondence relating to the Ernest Oldmeadow scandal over Black Mischief, and many EW entries in the Benefactors Book recording EW's contributions in kind (an Abyssinian painting) and in cash through his gifting the copyright of his Campion biography to the Hall. In addition, Stannard met someone who had met Waugh, and who has agreed to write an account of that meeting for the project.

Indeed, a new international symposium at the Huntington has been added this year, with the Huntington becoming an additional Project Partner. However, the project has also made a local impact through the Waugh Book Group, attendance of the public at project events, targeted Literary Leicester events, and creative writing sessions which have benefitted local students. Events are planned with the Arts Councils' Generic Learning Outcomes in mind, and feedback returned consistently reports positive changes in participants' behaviour as well as requests for more information about, and direct help with, our work.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>74ABEC6C-9C90-4D59-BF92-0F88D15E84C1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We continue to refine Prof Stannard's system of recording manuscript development and textual variants developed especially for CWEW, and our first volumes to use this system will be published in late summer 2017.

New Waugh-related primary materials continue to come to light through our high profile with Waugh archivists as well as collectors outside the academy. This year's highlight has been a previously undiscovered large pen-and-ink illustration by Waugh dating from 1929 and referencing key literary trends of the time.

We are also shaping thoughts in the textual editing field as we are able to share our methodologies with other large projects, most notably through the involvement of Prof Martin Stannard and Dr Barbara Cooke in Dr Bryony Randall's AHRC-funded New Modernist Editing Network, and through Prof. Stannard's assistance with the development of OUP's complete works of Ford Madox Ford and of Wyndham Lewis..</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our methodology is being studied as a model and adapted by other textual editing projects, particularly this working on Modernism such as Prof Paul Edwards' Wyndham Lewis edition.

The new illustration will be published in Prof Martin Stannard's Vile Bodies and Dr Cooke's Evelyn Waugh's Oxford (which is written for a lay audience), and exhibited in an independent London bookshop as part of an 'Evelyn Waugh, Artist' showcase.

The volumes themselves will contribute as reference for further scholarship and school education in the fields of textual editing, creative writing, life writing, cultural studies, and Modernism.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4C871A0A-363E-4D19-A262-2E931FCAA6BB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C7DECA4E-E040-4443-BFF8-D5857A410E96"><gtr:id>C7DECA4E-E040-4443-BFF8-D5857A410E96</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh: Personal Writings 1903-1921: Precocious Waughs: Volume 30</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471"><gtr:id>716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waugh Evelyn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199658961</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1DFCA3A6-2C48-4CAD-9C6E-1F4BFDE84113"><gtr:id>1DFCA3A6-2C48-4CAD-9C6E-1F4BFDE84113</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh: Vile Bodies: Volume 2</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471"><gtr:id>716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waugh Evelyn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199683451</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A0D19839-0584-4B7F-810D-CAE3FD13D582"><gtr:id>A0D19839-0584-4B7F-810D-CAE3FD13D582</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh: Rossetti His Life and Works: Volume 16</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471"><gtr:id>716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waugh Evelyn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199683574</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/05B32E03-4D13-465E-98A4-119A5CCE86CD"><gtr:id>05B32E03-4D13-465E-98A4-119A5CCE86CD</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh: Essays, Articles, and Reviews 1922-1934: Volume 26</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471"><gtr:id>716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waugh Evelyn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780199683444</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FCDCBF8D-34F5-4F76-9533-2E1697D6FC5A"><gtr:id>FCDCBF8D-34F5-4F76-9533-2E1697D6FC5A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Complete Works of Evelyn Waugh: A Little Learning: Volume 19</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471"><gtr:id>716077cbefcbd766b02812d2df434471</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Waugh Evelyn</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9780198702917</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1E1EF16A-0E90-44B6-A2ED-E35C4026BD56"><gtr:id>1E1EF16A-0E90-44B6-A2ED-E35C4026BD56</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Handbook of Editing Early Modern Texts (Material Readings in Early Modern Culture)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e5a93e534c3d7bd339bf720fb1b1c533"><gtr:id>e5a93e534c3d7bd339bf720fb1b1c533</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cooke, B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1472474780</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/033D368A-117D-42B7-AD1E-5BF2DB7826CC"><gtr:id>033D368A-117D-42B7-AD1E-5BF2DB7826CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oh!
