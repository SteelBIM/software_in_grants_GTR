Within 20 years, we expect to see fully autonomous vehicles, aircraft, robots, devices, swarms, and software, all of which will (and must) be able to make their own decisions without direct human intervention. The economic implications are enormous: for example, the global civil unmanned air- vehicle (UAV) market has been estimated to be &amp;pound;6B over the next 10 years, while the world-wide market for robotic systems is expected to exceed $50B by 2025.

This potential is both exciting and frightening. Exciting, in that this technology can allow us to develop systems and tackle tasks well beyond current possibilities. Frightening in that the control of these systems is now taken away from us. How do we know that they will work? How do we know that they are safe? And how can we trust them? All of these are impossible questions for current technology. We cannot say that such systems are safe, will not deliberately try to injure humans, and will always try their best to keep humans safe. Without such guarantees, these new technologies will neither be allowed by regulators nor accepted by the public.

Imagine that we have a generic architecture for autonomous systems such that the choices the system makes can be guaranteed? And these guarantees are backed by strong mathematical proof? If we have such an architecture, upon which our autonomous systems (be they robots, vehicles, or software) can be based, then we can indeed guarantee that our systems never intentionally act dangerously, will endeavour to be safe, and will - as far as possible - act in an ethical and trustworthy way. It is important to note that this is separate from the problem of how accurately the system understands its environment. Due to inaccuracy in modelling the real world, we cannot say that a system will be absolutely safe or will definitely achieve something; instead we can say that it tries to be safe and decides to carry out a taskto its best ability. This distinction is crucial: we can only prove that the system never decides to do the wrong thing, we cannot guarantee that accidents will never happen. Consequently, we also need to make an autonomous system judge the quality of its understanding and require it to act taking this into account. We should also verify, by our methods, that the system's choices do not exacerbate any potential safety problems.

Our hypothesis is that by identifying and separating out the high-level decision-making component within autonomous systems, and providing comprehensive formal verification techniques for this, we can indeed directly tackle questions of safety, ethics, legality and reliability. In this project, we build on internationally leading work on agent verification (Fisher), control and learning (Veres), safety and ethics (Winfield), and practical autonomous systems (Veres, Winfield) to advance the underlying verification techniques and so develop a framework allowing us to tackle questions such as the above. In developing autonomous systems for complex and unknown environments, being able to answer such questions is crucial.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Within 20 years, we expect to see fully autonomous vehicles, aircraft, robots, devices, swarms, and software, all of which will (and must) be able to make their own decisions without direct human intervention. This project will be relevant across many of these applications, from autonomous vehicles, such as driver-less cars and unmanned air vehicles, through to robotics, both in the home and in wider society. Since the control of autonomous systems is increasingly taken away from humans: how can we be sure that they will work; how can we be confident that they are safe; and how can we trust them? All of these are impossible questions for current technology. We cannot say that such systems are safe, will not deliberately try to injure humans, and will always try their best to keep humans safe. Without such guarantees, these new technologies will neither be allowed by regulators nor accepted by the public.

Consequently, the core problem with this technology is being able to effectively verify the inherent autonomy. This is the focus of our project and its potential impact reaches across all those in academia, industry, and government involved in the development, social acceptance, and legality of truly autonomous systems.

Specifically in WP6 and WP7 we have outlined our initial network of collaborating companies, covering Robotic Assistants (Elumotion) and Automotive (MIRA), later with (if sufficient progress) Nuclear Robotics (NNL), and potentially in Underwater (Thales), and Space Exploration (European Space Agency). However, we intend to broaden the industrial aspect and promote and expand the companies aware of, and developing, &amp;quot;verifiable autonomous systems&amp;quot;. This promotion will build on our existing networks, for example the industrial members of the Autonomous and Intelligent Systems Partnership; industrial members of the Autonomous Systems National Technical Committee; industrial members of the British Automation and Robot Association; and industrial participants with the Virtual Engineering Centre. 

We aim to engage closely with governmental agencies, professional societies, European and international institutions to contribute to the public debate on issues influenced by autonomous systems, leveraging and deepening our existing memberships and influence in such bodies. We aim to develop a suitable activity within one of the relevant learned societies to increase engagement with the scientific and policy communities.

We have already seen, particularly through Winfield's work on public engagement, how autonomous systems (typically, Robotics) can spark the public's imagination. We will build on this, expand to other forms of autonomous systems (UAVs and driver-less cars are natural possibilities), and target public engagement events such as the Cheltenham Science Festival and the British Science Festival (Winfield has already been involved with the former) later in the project. 

In summary, through deeper engagement later in the project we aim to impact upon broader industry, and both knowledge transfer and business development branches of government. The team, together with their respective universities, have effective mechanisms for dealing with the media, with access to press offices who regularly publicise work nationally and internationally to non-academic audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>640791</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Robots at Tate Liverpool</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D90242F-CF32-4974-912B-26650E0C2CC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From Summer 2016 to Spring 2017 we worked with the artist Cecile B. Evans to produce an exhibit comprising robotic performances. This was hosted by the Tate Gallery at Liverpool and currently has had over 130,000 visitors.

In addition to the exhibit, involving 2 humanoid robots, a robot dog, and many videos, we held a talk/workshop at which the artist and Prof. Fisher engaged with members of the public about both the exhibit and about future developments.
