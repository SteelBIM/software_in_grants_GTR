The process he uncovered is called transformation and the importance of its discovery for the subsequent development of biology cannot be overstated. Among other things, this work provided the first evidence challenging the widespread belief that bacterial species were 'fixed' entities, and it was also this work that led ultimately to the discovery of DNA as the carrier of genetic information. However, despite the ~80 years that have elapsed since the publication of his work, there remains no clear explanation for why transformation exists. In other words, what advantage does the ability to take up DNA from the environment confer to bacteria that allowed the process of transformation to evolve and persist in bacteria? A series of largely untested explanations have been offered to explain the evolutionary processes that maintain transformation in bacteria: 1) environmentally acquired DNA is used to repair DNA damaged by stress or other intrinsic errors of replication; 2) DNA is used as a nutrient in times of resource shortage; 3) transformation, and specifically processes associated with it, is used to kill ecological competitors; and 4) recombined DNA is used to gain novel beneficial mutations and to thereby accelerate adaptation. The aim of this proposal is to critically test these ideas using the species in which transformation was discovered, S. pneumoniae. The evolutionary success of a trait becomes increasingly likely as the advantages it causes become larger. Yet even the most useful features of organisms can come with attached costs. For example, bacteria that are able to survive in the presence of lethal drugs designed to kill them also tend to have reduced growth rates when compared to cells that are susceptible but otherwise identical. In order for transformation to persist, its costs must on balance be smaller than its benefits. For if not, transformation may be lost. The work in this proposal will quantify the specific costs and benefits of transformation in the pneumococcus. To do so I will study competitive interactions among bacterial isolates that vary in their ability to take up and incorporate DNA. Isolates for this work will be designed in the laboratory and will also be taken from nature. I will determine the effects of different rates of recombination on short and long term evolutionary change. Together these studies will critically test the prevailing hypotheses put forward to explain the maintenance of this very important trait.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Natural transformation in bacteria is often viewed as an analogue to eukaryotic sex. Just as there is little consensus regarding the evolutionary processes that led to the origin and maintenance of eukaryotic sex, there remains considerable uncertainty as to why transformation evolved and is maintained among prokaryotes. The specific objective of the proposed study is to understand the evolutionary processes maintaining transformation by determining the manner in which the naturally competent bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae balances the costs and benefits of transformation. The specific aims are to: 1) Quantify the natural variation in transformation rates in S. pneumoniae; 2) Quantify the costs and benefits of natural competence using natural and laboratory isolates; and 3) Quantify the short- and long-term adaptive advantages of transformation. Results will provide critical data for the development of a more general hypothesis for the evolution and role of recombination across life.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-04-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>489776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In 1928 Griffiths published his groundbreaking work showing that extracts of dead Streptococcus pneumoniae cells could convert a benign strain of the same species into one capable of causing disease. The process he uncovered is called transformation, which is the uptake and incorporation of DNA from the environment into bacterial cells. This work provided the first evidence that bacterial cells are not &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; entities, and ultimately led to the discovery of DNA as the carrier of genetic information. However, despite the ~80 years that have elapsed since the publication of his work, there remains no clear explanation for why transformation exists. In other words, what advantage does the ability to take up DNA from the environment confer to bacteria that allowed the process of transformation to evolve and persist in bacteria?

Several largely untested explanations have been offered to explain the evolutionary processes that maintain transformation in bacteria: 1) environmentally acquired DNA is used to repair damaged DNA; 2) DNA is used as a nutrient in times of resource shortage; 3) recombined DNA is used to gain novel beneficial mutations to thereby accelerate adaptation. Our work utilized a series of complementary approaches to test and provide support for yet a fourth explanation. Specifically we show that, bacterial transformation provides bacteria with benefits when cells are faced with short or long-term environmental stress or with genomic stress due to mutations that reduce cellular fitness. 

To show this we carried out experiments using bacterial strains that were engineered so that they were unable to take up foreign DNA. In colloquial terms, we call these cells &amp;quot;asexual&amp;quot; because they lack the ability to recombine DNA from the environment into their genomes. When these cells are compared to their &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; parents, they die more rapidly in the presence of antibiotics, which is stressful for microbes. Next, we compared the rate of adaptation of normal and mutant cells during evolution in the lab for 1,000 bacterial generations. To our surprise, we found that &amp;quot;asexual&amp;quot; cells actually evolved faster, indicating that transformation is costly to cells; this result clearly contradicts the widely held view that transformation accelerates adaptation. Crucially, when cells evolved with periodic antibiotic stress, the costs of transformation disappeared. We next determined the whole genome sequences of our evolved bacterial isolates and determined that transformable cells accumulate far fewer mutations than their &amp;quot;asexual&amp;quot; counterparts; in other words, transformation allows stressed bacterial cells to remove mutations that cause them harm. In support of this, in a final large experiment we found that non-mutant cells lose fitness more slowly than &amp;quot;asexual&amp;quot; cells when both were evolved in an environment where they were likely to accumulate harmful mutations due to genetic drift.

Together, our results provide strong support that transformation is directly beneficial to bacterial cells, and provides a clear and novel explanation for why this is the case. This result is important because it reveals yet another process by which bacteria have evolved to respond to environmental and genomic stress. More specifically, the result is important in S. pneumoniae because transformation in this species is a key mechanism these cells use to move genes conferring antibiotic resistance and other virulence factors from cell to cell. The results of our study show that while such gene transfer is clearly important for pneumococcal disease because it can lead to treatment failure, it is not the evolutionary reason why transformation exists. Pneumococcal transformation long predates the medical use of antibiotics, but these bacteria have always faced stress in other forms. The work carried out during this period of BBSRC funding shows that transformation persists because it enables cells to cope with these more ordinary daily challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work paves the way to understand bacterial sex more generally across diverse species, especially bacterial pathogens.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3D18DA5-C56F-453C-B4B0-1B40B58A4BAD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C49E02D3-F53A-4AE7-8186-5D62D250F6B4"><gtr:id>C49E02D3-F53A-4AE7-8186-5D62D250F6B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Variation in Streptococcus pneumoniae susceptibility to human antimicrobial peptides may mediate intraspecific competition.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
