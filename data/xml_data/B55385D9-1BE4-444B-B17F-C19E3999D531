Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K005944/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Good tax design and administration are central to the functioning of the economy. Taxes are important determinants of economic behaviour, and good implementation can significantly increase economic and social welfare. The role of the Tax Administration Research Centre is to deliver research that enhances tax policy and provides lasting benefit to the economy. There are many research tools that can contribute to this goal but the greatest success will be achieved by combining a range of research methodologies and disciplines.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Centre unites researchers from two institutions with distinguished reputations for research into tax administration and tax design. Complementary abilities and methodologies are brought together to address a wide range of intersecting research projects. The research methodologies include economic modelling, econometric analysis, experimentation, numerical simulation, and qualitative analysis. In undertaking its work the Centre makes extensive use of the HMRC/HMT Datalab to permit innovative empirical work to be undertaken.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Centre aims to enhance tax administration and tax design. It has ambitious plans to become the leading international centre with a central role in research and in building research capability in tax analysis through the training of PhD students and training of research staff.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The immediate impact of the Centre's activities will be an improved understanding in tax authorities in the UK and other countries of how they can enhance tax policies and administrative practices in order to better achieve the fundamental aims of the tax system. Specifically, for the UK the Centre will aid fulfilment of the aims of Parliament: to raise the desired level of revenues equitably and at least economic cost, with the minimum of administrative cost. In addition, the Centre will impact positively on the consumer experience and, through international benchmarking, drive quality improvements for tax authorities worldwide. This impact will be especially strong as the research topics for the Centre have been guided by the questions identified by the HMRC/HMT as important to their service delivery.

A further impact is that the Centre's work will benefit the international tax research community by developing a novel interdisciplinary approach to tax analysis, advancing knowledge, demonstrating innovative ways of exploiting the Datalab, training PhD students to build research capacity, and offering practical advice on the implementation of its research findings in the international context. This will generate further original research around the world to enhance tax policies and administrative practices. The academic community will benefit from membership of the Centre as International Fellows, from the visitor programme, and from participation in workshops organised by the Centre. The first international workshop is scheduled to coincide with the launch of the Centre. The Centre will also generate impact through building research capacity for the HMRC/HMT through training courses, Master Classes, and secondments.

The impact of enhanced tax policies and administrative practices will be felt in the wider community. There are clear gains to taxpayers and the economy of a tax system that is well designed and efficiently administered. Better design and administration ensure that more tax revenue is raised for given tax rates so avoiding the deleterious effects of higher rates. It also reduces the incentive for taxpayers to engage in costly tax avoidance and raises social cohesion by improving the fairness of the tax system. Improving the customer experience will also enhance the public's attitude to the tax system. These are salient impacts for public policy in the UK, and many other countries, given the current imperative to reduce large public debts and promote economic growth.

Centre members will undertake research of the highest standard that informs policy and will be published in leading academic journals. Workshops will provide opportunities for dissemination to a targeted audience. The Centre's research will also be disseminated through presentations at seminars and international conferences. The Centre will also provide user-focussed dissemination by means of reports, briefings, and presentations at HMRC/HMT. Practitioners will benefit from the training courses and Master Classes organized by the Centre. The Centre workshops will be open to practitioners from the UK and from overseas. These activities, as well as the Centre's publications aimed at tax authorities, will benefit policy by reporting the latest advances in tax research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1998976</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>South African Tax Research Centre (SATRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with South African Tax Research Centre (SATRC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C739C6E-4362-4076-A4D9-C50C0EB0BD1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Received requests/interest in research of TARC from researchers at various institutions across the globe.

It is highly skilled in studying realistic economic problems using mathematical and interdisciplinary analysis and other relevant methods. There are some research areas such as agent-based modeling (ABM), experimental economics, and game theory that have risen to prominence in IQTE in recent years. The application of these methods has been focused on economic development and social welfare enhancement. Cai (2015) exploited big data techniques to show how to understand the effect of micro-behavioural characteristics on macro outcomes, Dong (2014) analyzed the behaviour of trans-national investors to explain outcomes in international financial and capital markets, Wang (2012, 2014) explored income gap evolution and public services in China using experimental methods incorporating human subjects and computational agents with support from the NSFC. IQTE intends to develop further capabilities in behavioral analysis and wishes to pay increasing attention to understanding macro outcomes through deeper analysis of micro behavior. The understanding of the behavioral compatibility between individual choice and collective action will be applied to policy issues confronting the Chinese economy.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Behavioural Compatibility between Individual Choice and Collective Action

TARC has developed considerable expertise in applying agent-based modeling to investigate audit strategies. The simulations in Hashimzade et al. (2013, 2014a, 2014b) base the modeling of individual agents on recent advances in behavioural economics. The agents make choices under risk with non-expected utility preferences, learn attitudes and beliefs from interaction in a social network, and make decisions taking into account the social environment in which they are located. The methods underlying this work can be extended and modified to address a much broader set of policy questions. 

TARC also has specialized capabilities in experimental economics. It has ready access to a large body of student experimental subjects. More importantly, it has pioneered the use of online experiments in collaboration with market research companies to target specific sectors of the population. The results in Fonseca et al. (2015) demonstrate the value of using online experiments to access a subject pool of the self-employed, whose experimental behaviour is significantly different from that of the student population. TARC also provides competence at econometric analysis and the analysis of large datasets. Advani et al. (2015) demonstrates how a question that has long been debated - the effect on future compliance of an audit - can be answered by applying imaginative empirical techniques to administrative data</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chartered Institute of Taxation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Journal of Tax Administration</gtr:description><gtr:id>F44A9FF1-66E0-4285-B23D-71C8602C180C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Shared responsibilities; CIOT provide funding and knowledge of areas of interest, and TARC manage the journal</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Creation of a new open access journal for interdisciplinary tax research in the area of tax administration.

In the final presentation, Karen Boll, Copenhagen Business School and Lynne Oats, Exeter University presented their research on the topic &amp;quot;What makes Tax Collection Sustainable?&amp;quot;. The researchers pointed out that the administrative dimension of tax policy implementation is crucial to its success. Using the case of large businesses, cooperative relationships between taxpayers and tax authorities are being examined in several countries to identify features leading to sustainability and barriers to success.

The discussant for this session, Hans Gribnau, Tilburg University, responded to the presentation and noted that willingness of the taxpayers to comply with taxes is at the heart of cooperative compliance. There is a common interest between the tax administration and the taxpayer in getting a clear, certain result. Mutual trust is an important element in the success of cooperative arrangements.

The presentation was followed by a question and answer session, during which some very interesting and thought provoking questions were put to both the presenters and discussants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IAPR (Greece) - CK President of the IAPR Management Board</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7FA99D9B-FEDF-4EAD-8138-F6411E75E137</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Christos Kotsogiannis was elected as the President of the Management Board of the IAPR (Independent Authority for Public Revenue) of Greece in February 2016, the Greek equivalent to HMRC.

There is a close working relationship between TARC and HMRC. Each project is assigned key contacts within Knowledge and Intelligence (KAI) at HMRC and further linked with stakeholders within HMRC. The research design requires that the TARC projects have benefit for the stakeholders within HMRC. The research outputs have fed back to inform the operations of the stakeholders. Two projects illustrate this work. TARC has been engaged in experiment work to determine the reaction of taxpayers to pre-population of tax returns. The intention of HMRC is to digitize all operations and to move to pre-population. The research of TARC has revealed the ways in which taxpayers react to pre-population returns that have information missing on some sources of income or incorrect pre-populated information. This research will inform the approach that HMRC take to the implementation of pre-population. A second TARC project has considered the effect of tax amnesties to encourage the declaration of income held abroad. This work has been presented at HMRC to very interested audiences and will be an input into the design of future amnesty projects.
The TARC projects are informed by policy issues and pursued in close collaboration with HMRC. We are also pursuing public engagement activities informed by the work TARC pursues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>40776F12-E72F-4F6C-ABEB-1DDEABB56096</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>TARC has produced research along many dimensions. Key findings from a selection of projects are as follows: 
An interview based study canvassing opinions of tax advisors to large businesses from a range of backgrounds regarding recent developments in the relationship with HMRC. The project finds that the market for tax advice for large business taxpayers is complex and dynamic, responding to recent initiatives designed to curtail the incidence of tax avoidance . 
A qualitative study of how people talk about tax and compliance obligations in social media finds that most participants are not concerned with finding ways to avoid paying taxes, but rather are wanting to comply with their tax obligations and find it difficult to find out the correct procedures. There is evidence of social pressure, especially in relation to newcomers to the tax regime. 

A project looking at the tax gap and has produced some interesting findings using ONS data that are being used by HMRC. The research investigated the extent of income underreporting by the self-employed in Great Britain for the period 2010-12 and the characteristics of the individuals most associated with non-compliance with the aim of answering not only 'How Much' but also 'Who'. It found that self-employment income is underreported on average by 19.3%, which translates into a lower bound estimate of unreported taxable income of 1.6% of GDP.

The researchers further investigated which characteristics of the individuals are mostly associated to noncompliance using not only characteristics that typically appear on tax returns but also a wider range of socioeconomic characteristics ('Who?'). They found that men are less compliant than women and that individuals become more compliant as they age. Regarding occupations, blue-collar households seem to underreport more than white-collar. Self-employed operating in partnerships are found to underreport more than own account self-employed and the presence of more than one self-employed in the household seems to give more opportunity to evade.
Overall, this study responds to a need for a reassessment of the extent of income underreporting by the self-employed as it is becoming an increasingly common occupational choice in the UK. The findings of this study are useful to inform the revenue agency about the individuals to whom compliance activities should be directed in order to increase their impact given that resources are limited.

A fourth project investigated the dynamic effects of tax audits on income reported in subsequent tax returns. Results suggest that audits lead to a modest increase in survival in self assessment for two years after the audit, peaking at 1.1 percentage points in year two before falling back. This pattern is consistent with individuals being more diligent in filing their tax returns while audit investigations are ongoing. For reported total taxable income, we find a statistically significant increase of &amp;pound;795 two years after audit. Increases in subsequent years are not significant but are still substantial at around &amp;pound;500 until at least the sixth year after audit. For total tax, the point estimates are all positive but are not significant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have produced a number of academic publications and reports.

The first masterclass was held in November. The class was given by Brian Erard who has published on tax compliance and has extensive consulting experience with US Internal Revenue Service. The target was to attract 20 participants to the masterclass. This was considerably exceeded and eventually 39 participants registered. Over 70 percent of the participants were tax administrators, (including representatives from the Australian Tax Office, Canada Revenue Service, Danish Customs and Tax Administration, HMRC, and the Italian Revenue Agency. The academics participants were from the UK and Germany. 
The class was focussed on the measurement of the tax gap. HMRC have a formal duty to report an annual measure of the tax gap and are continually seeking to improve the measure. Brian Erard has provided advice to the IRS on statistical methods to improve measurement of the tax gap. The participants valued this experience and the satisfaction ratings submitted at the end of the masterclass were excellent. The masterclass was a perfect knowledge exchange activity with two days of active discussion and interaction.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>TARC and Field experiments meeting with HMRC/TARC researchers - Dec 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2260D989-2CB8-4DC9-ACBA-23F12AC97148</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Office for Tax Simplification stakeholder discussion on priorities for tax simplification</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB67CDD0-1E3A-464C-8DFA-671CDBA18F6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stuart Adam</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Meeting with HM Revenue and Customs officials about evaluating the impact of Making Tax Digital for Business</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>945B49D3-D3E8-40BD-8BA7-DFA74F331A00</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with HM Revenue and Customs officials about evaluating the impact of Making Tax Digital for Business.
