Prenatal sex selection against females (PSS) for non-medical reasons has also been evidenced among Asian communities in the UK, the USA, and Canada. PSS is of considerable concern for the communities at risk, women's groups, the health sector, policy makers and society at large. The overarching aim of this proposal is to evaluate gender preferences through reproductive choices among Asian communities in the UK and gain a contextual understanding of the dynamic factors at play (objectives 1-3) that will inform an ethically founded and gender justice based design of policy and interventions aiming to address son preference and PSS (objectives 4-6).

The proposed project responds to the explicit calls for research on policy development with regard to son preference and sex-selection in the UK, Europe and Asia, ensuring the high propensity for policy related impact (see for instance Serious Crime Act 2015, section 84 (UK); resolution 1829 of the Council of Europe; the interagency statement 'Preventing gender-biased sex selection' of the OHCHR, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women and WHO. To coherently tackle the multifaceted aspects of the topic, the project brings together extensive expertise on prenatal sex selection (SD, MU) that will enable ethically-based qualitative and quantitative approaches that are all relevant for informed policy. 

Using available demographic data from various sources and innovative demographic methods, we will monitor sex ratio at birth (SRB), trends and intergenerational changes, providing novel and robust evidence of the extent of PSS and characteristics of populations at risk of PSS in the UK. We will evaluate sex selection events and son-preference to gain novel insights into reproductive behaviour in relation to son-preference, which though rooted in traditional patriarchy is changing in character. We will undertake a qualitative analysis of inter-generational family dynamics within the Asian communities to investigate contextualised practices of gender preferences and mechanisms and factors of change. An in-depth understanding of the interdependencies between factors underpinning gender preferences provides a rare opportunity to contribute to the theories of gender inequality. this work will investigate not only the pervasiveness of the gendered social order and shifting patriarchal cultures within Asian communities but also the dynamic interrelation of differently gendered social systems. This would help describe and understand how the intersection of class, age and race/ethnicity qualify gender embeddedness within the changing social fabric of contemporary British society, inform the potential diversity of complex gendered experiences including how this is challenging (or not) the very idea of gender norms. The proposed work will also provide a rich case study to advance transnational theories.
Outcomes are likely to support informed policy interventions aimed at normative, cultural and behavioural changes. In addition, we will conduct an ethical analysis within a gender justice framework that will, combined with a policy framing analysis, further inform best practice of potential interventions and support communication of the above research findings. Throughout, a variety of stakeholders (academics, medical professionals, women's groups/NGOs, policy makers) will be engaged in this multi-disciplinary project, including the Department of Health (partner, see letter of support), to provide the best evidence-based knowledge on son preference and PSS that is first, of direct relevance to the women concerned, their family, community-based women's organisations, and the medical sector, and secondly, of importance to inform policies promoting gender equality in the UK and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Son preference and prenatal sex selection against females (PNSSaF) is of interest to a variety of academic disciplines, including demography (methods to evidence PNSSaF, population gender imbalances, population dynamics), broader social sciences (gender inequalities, family structures and dynamics, social and gender theories), the medical profession (prenatal sex diagnostics, IVF gender selection, public health), ethics (freedom of choice, agency, deontology, normative ethics and gender justice framework), law and political sciences (policy framing, legislation to address PNSSaF and applied ethics). The project will shed unprecedented insights into various aspects of PNSSaF that are of wide academic interest and building on strong track records and international standing in the field, the applicants expect to publish findings in highest impact journals, contributing to the scientific excellence of the UK. 

Beyond academia, this project will provide currently unavailable data, knowledge and methodologies that have been explicitly demanded by policy makers and civil society. Resolution 1829 of the Council of Europe calls on member states to: 'collect the sex ratio at birth, monitor its development and take prompt action to tackle possible imbalances; encourage research on sex ratios at birth among specific communities; promote research on the causes of prenatal sex selection and its social consequences; encourage national ethics bodies to elaborate and introduce guidelines for medical staff '. Work packages 1-6 directly speak to these demands. The interagency statement 'Preventing gender-biased sex selection' of the OHCHR, UNFPA, UNICEF, UN Women and WHO recommended actions include: the production of more reliable data (WP1), the development of indicators tracking change (WP2); qualitative studies that explore the contextual realities that underlie sex-selection motivations and practices (WP3); elaborate and implement policies to address the root causes of son preference (WP4-6). In the UK, the Serious Crime Act 2015, section 84 (UK) asks the Secretary of State to 'assess the evidence on termination of pregnancy on the grounds of the sex of the foetus; to promote change in the social and cultural patterns of behaviour ....which are based on the idea of the inferiority of women and which may amount to pressure to seek a termination on the grounds of the sex of the foetus; and to promote guidance to service providers, health professionals and other stakeholders '. WP1-6 will all contribute to inform envisaged government policy on PNSSaF in the UK and explaining the involvement of the Department of Health in this project (partner), the nature of this collaboration is detailed in the letter of support. Sylvie Dubuc has previously advised the Department of Health on demographic methodologies regarding PNSSaF and building trust. Outcomes will also be communicated to the UN, UN-FPA the WHO and the Council of Europe, SD has previously advised these bodies on the topic and enjoys good working relations. For detailed communication strategy and plans, please see Pathways to Impact. 

PNSSaF is a sensitive issue and of considerable public interest. The applicants are fully aware of media representations with potential risks, including ethnic stereotyping and the use of sex-selection in broader anti-abortion arguments. Both SD and MU have a proven track record in responsibly communicating research outcomes on sensitive issues to the media. PNSSaF is primarily and fundamentally a gender inequality issue and the wider debate on PNSSaF will greatly benefit from our policy framing analysis (WP4) and outcomes from WP5 analysing the rights and ethics of PNSSaF within a gender justice framework. Overall, we expect this project to make substantial impacts on how PNSSaF is understood, perceived and addressed with the global aim to reduce gender inequalities and discrimination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>661740</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N01877X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>808111E3-5E04-4CEF-B080-565A81EFD6D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8785A44-DFE5-4A95-99D0-1A49582F1688</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography (General)</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2093C2F8-C10A-40EE-A71D-387F3BA92968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Kinship Health &amp; relatedness</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>80A901A1-6A1F-4860-A8F4-3D3FE7D528E2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive and sexual health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
