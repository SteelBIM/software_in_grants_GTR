One of the principal sources of AABW has its roots in the production of cold, dense water that results from wintertime sea-ice production over the continental shelf of the southwestern Weddell Sea. However, there remains great uncertainty about the processes controlling the initial import of the source waters onto the continental shelf, and the export of the dense waters from the shelf regime. The uncertainty results from the extremely challenging sea ice conditions existing in the southern Weddell Sea, especially during winter. Conditions in the area of interest during winter are exceptionally difficult for any ship-based work, and instruments deployed in the ocean during the rather less difficult summer months, and which are left to monitor the water properties over the Winter period, are vulnerable to dredging by passing icebergs. We will tackle the problem using a technology that has recently come of age. We propose to attach conductivity-temperature-deph (CTD) tags, miniaturised oceanographic instruments, to Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The tags have a satellite transmitter that relays the oceanographic data collected during the seals' dives, together with the dive location. The tag is glued harmlessly to the animal's fur using standard marine two-component epoxy and comes off again during the annual moult about eleven months later. A pilot study undertaken by the British Antarctic Survey involved the tagging of four seals, three of which supplied over-winter datasets. Although the coverage was impressive from only three tags, emphatically confirming the practicality of the technique, the region of interest is nearly 500,000 km^2 in area and a comprehensive dataset requires substantially more tagged animals. We will tag 20 Weddell seals at the eastern end of the shelfbreak north of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf during the late Austral summer of 2010/2011. The resulting dataset resulting from the animals' dives during the winter will give the most comprehensive picture to date of the ocean conditions over the southern Weddell Sea continental shelf. By mapping the temperature of the water near the sea floor we will determine the locations where dense waters leave the shelf, and the processes involved: either a direct flow down the slope under gravity, or initially mixing at the shelf edge with waters from off the shelf before descending down the slope. We will also be able to determine where the source waters come on to the shelf. Weddell seals are very accomplished divers, diving repeatedly for long periods and to depths regularly reaching the on-shelf seafloor. Among Antarctic seals, Weddell seals also inhabit the southernmost waters, and remain within the pack-ice in winter when the ice expands northward. These characteristics make Weddell seals ideally suited for the proposed study. Although primarily an oceanographic project, the movements and diving behaviour of Weddell seals is of great interest to seal biologists who wish to understand differing behaviours in different parts of Antarctica. These variations were ably demonstrated by the extraordinarily diverse behaviour of the animals tagged during the pilot, and by comparisons with previous tracking of this species in other parts of the Antarctic. The long-ranging movements displayed by some of the seals tracked during the pilot study are untypical for the species, at least at other Antarctic locations, and may be related to the local oceanographic conditions. It is widely recognised that multidisciplinary studies such as proposed here will provide us with the tools to better predict how the distribution, behaviour and ultimately population status may be affected by changing ocean and climate conditions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>64558</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A book of creative ways to display geographical information and associated data</gtr:description><gtr:id>B9BCA33D-7692-483B-9876-0F14D43A8A68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Popular &amp;quot;coffee table&amp;quot; book which, among many examples, uses information from seals to map a set of animal movements withing oceanographic parameters.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Where The Animals Go: Tracking Wildlife with Technology in 50 Maps and Graphics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://wheretheanimalsgo.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of California Santa Cruz</gtr:description><gtr:id>E44EE05A-B178-48D4-B2F8-114C1DD8C98D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is obviously necessary to &amp;quot;account&amp;quot; for investment in science by some process. And unfortunately, it is felt this process has to take into account the very narrow vision of science that seems to dominate the governance of science these days. But by overly constraining the expression of this value, the process may itself defeat its purpose. I believe that with researchfish, this is the case.
The simplest way I can think of supporting this notion is via an example of how NERC investment in a linked chain of my NERC grants has created a string of high impact papers, an unprecedented legacy of ocean data and a rich global network of collaborators that collectively have brought in a high level of resources synergistically to support the work. On top of this, the collective of people associated with these projects supported the technological development and evolution of unique methodology within SMRU Instrumentation. It is worth remembering that SMRU Instrumentation is a group supported largely by the &amp;quot;sales&amp;quot; (with a turnover of 1 M &amp;pound;, much from overseas) of the monitoring equipment for observing the ocean used in these grants, which both facilitates collection of observations from important but unobserved times and locations with drastically reduced cost and logistic requirements. 
So how did NERC funding help to bring the remarkable success of these projects about? And how much funding did it leverage? It's not a simple story and not one that can be reflected in researchfish in any sensible way. The only way to shoe-horn it into the system forces the misrepresentation of the process of the scientific endeavour itself. 
The chain of my NERC projects involving ocean obs started with a &amp;pound;5000 pound NERC grant to build a couple of the first animal-carried ocean profiling instruments, CTD-SRDLs. The initial development of these tags had been supported with about &amp;pound;20,000 pounds from the Norwegian Polar Institute and then later, $250,000 from the US Office of Naval Research. The success of these &amp;quot;proof of concept&amp;quot; instruments resulted in my submitting a NERC grant to support their first large-scale deployment in the Southern Ocean on elephant seals. We also sold tags to researchers in France, Australia and the US to deploy the tags simultaneously on elephant seals in their areas of interest in the Southern Ocean. The combine effort was collectively known as the SEaOS project. The success of this project led to an even larger follow-on project in both polar oceans involving 10 different countries, MEOPP (an awkwardMarine Mammals Exploring the ocean Pole to Pole). It was part of the International Polar Year. Collectively, these projects generated data about the distribution, behaviour and environmental associations 100s of seals and produced hundreds of thousands of ocean profiles from the seas around f both poles, often from unsampled times and locations. These projects generated momentum of animal platform approach that has led to a growing range of onging projects and new proposals. To date, the many hundreds of animals that have carried the tags have delivered almost 400,000 ocean profiles and these data sets numerically outnumber all other data available in the Southern Ocean . 
All of the data were sent out on the GTS and are or will be freely available, either through the world ocean database or in published data sets. They projects have generated a large and growing number of publications and have been used operationally by the Met office. How do we capture the value of this in Researcfish?
The success of SEaOS and MEOPP lhas also led on to the current ocean2ice project (part of NERC iStar project) includes the use of seals to study the oceanic heat flow to the Pine Island glacier. The BAS ship, JCR , moorings and autosub collected detailed highly accurate data from the immediate area during the month it was in position. The seals provided an additional 12000 CTD profiles in a wide area of some 20,000 km^2 from February through October that dramatically increased the value of the other data sources. How do you account for that increase in value in researchfish terms?
The NERC contribution to this complex set of interlinked project was critically important but represents only a small fraction of the total cost of the combined effort. The value of the data , however, very much depended on the scale large cooperative effort involved.
The deployment of these tags and the analysis of the data collected involved universities, research institutions and the polar research arms of all the countries in 10 countries. Ships, logistics, maintenance of bases, help from voluntary technical personnel, etc. are all involved and sometimes un-costed even in each group's proposals . Assigning contributions in cash or kind in a realistic way is impossible for me. So I will not even attempt to include all these links collaborations in my researchfish input. The only way I could do it is by pulling numbers out of the air to satisfy the required fields and I will not do this.
In the final analysis, the value of the larger global, cooperative project and each national component of it cannot be measured in simple monetary terms but only in its on-going academic output, the growing use of the data in publications and models, the way the approach affects, in a difficult to determine way, the cost effectiveness of the general on-going effort in ocean observation. Perhaps, more importantly, researchfish , in demanding that we pound large round pegs in small square holes, can't even start to assess, in any realistic way, how the improved understanding of the behaviour of the oceans in the climate system allows us to plan ahead and prepare for change nor the value of understanding of the functioning of a complex and exploited marine ecosystem. 
I think the real worry is that in using such constrained accounting practices to provide a narrow measure of value to pander to a government that seems only able to measure value in simple monetary terms, you risk throwing the baby out with the bathwater. You devalue the process of science and lead to a downward spiral in the perception of that value in government and the public. This really is a dangerous spiral to get caught in. 
Perhaps I am taking researchfish too seriously and should just ignore its inadequacies. Like I suspect many more sensible people will do, I should just fill in the forms as quickly as possible and get on with useful work, treating the task as just one more of the many silly things we have to do to satisfy an increasing perceived need for detailed accounting, regardless of how unrealistic the results are. But I feel I should at least try to make the case for a developing broader, more meaningful approach for &amp;quot;valuing&amp;quot; my scientific efforts. In the final analysis, I thought expressing these concerns was more valuable than labouring over a flawed set of forms.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>expertise, equipment, logistic support, analysis, writing</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>expertise, equipment, analysis, writing</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>British Antarctic Survey</gtr:department><gtr:description>BAS Weddell Sea</gtr:description><gtr:id>44CD3B54-D364-4CE8-BE20-936F052BFEC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several papers directly related to the particular data from Award set have been published.

&amp;quot;The current and future melt rate of polar glaciers and ice sheets will have long term effects on sea global levels. The fate of land-based ice is strongly affected by the floating ice shelves that hem them in, restraining their movements. The integrity of these shelves is largely determined by heat reaching them from warmer deep water flowing in over the continental shelf and deeper water driven by oceanographic processes. The Pine Island Glacier in West Antarctica drains an area 2/3 that of the entire UK and may contribute 3.5-10mm to global sea level rise in the next 20 years. It has been chosen for intensive monitoring involving all the normal tools in the physical oceanographer's toolbox.
In January 2014 the British Antarctic survey ship the James Clarke Ross visited the area, deploying standard CTDs and stationary moorings which have to be retrieved in later years to recover the detailed fixed point data they record on currents, temperatures and depth. Similar data can be made while on a cruise, but troubles with icing on antennas and cables can make the instrumentation difficult to deploy and recover. Robotic gliders can be deployed to scout the sub ice topography and ride the currents but can only do so when a mothership is nearby. Ships visit the area only infrequently and cruises are very costly. Biologists joined the oceanographers and glaciologists on this cruise to tag seals with devices that provide ocean data, much like those collected directly by the ship-based oceanographers. The elephant and Weddell seals can record depth, temperature and salinity profiles during their normal deep diving activities, and don't stop when the ship leaves. In mid June 2014, the animal's tags were still transmitting data during the dark polar winter. 'The animals keep on working long after the ship has had to leave, and will forage naturally into areas that the captain would just not risk on a ship, particularly one that is not an icebreaker,' says SMRU's Fedak, who endured freezing conditions to put the tags on the 500 kilo seals who routinely dive to 800 metres. 'The tagged data doesn't replace conventional oceanographic instrumentation, but it is another useful tool for exploring the ice covered polar regions in particular.'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2014/07/tracking-wildlife-how-scientists-monitor-endangered-species/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Times Newspaper article</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>487E1FE2-AB75-4BE6-8E6E-DFEF7CC005F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feature article in the Times: 24/8/2016 Seals help track down the cold hard facts</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seals-help-scientists-track-down-the-cold-hard-facts-jsrfq666k</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hannah Waters Interview for Vice Motherboard &quot;The internet of elephant seals&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9ABB62CA-AA57-4D7C-BE5E-B9F271DCF1DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Story for on-line publication.

One of the principal sources of AABW has its roots in the production of cold, dense water that results from wintertime sea-ice production over the continental shelf of the southwestern Weddell Sea. However, there remains great uncertainty about the processes controlling the initial import of the source waters onto the continental shelf, and the export of the dense waters from the shelf regime. The uncertainty results from the extremely challenging sea ice conditions existing in the southern Weddell Sea, especially during winter.

Conditions in the area of interest during winter are exceptionally difficult for any ship-based work so we enlisted seals to help collect the data. This project set the foundations for understanding the shelfbreak processes in the Weddell Sea thought to be instrumental in controlling the flushing of the continental shelf, and the export of dense shelf waters that contribute to the production of Antarctic Bottom Water. As a serendipitous result, we learned much about the distribution and behaviour of seals deep in the Weddell Sea and observed them breaking records for diving in some of the World's coldest water. The animals dive into supercooled water less than -2 degrees Centigrade, which emerges from under the Filchner ice shelf at depths of 500 m, which allows the relatively fresh to remain liquid well below its freezing point.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The use of the approach of using animals as platforms for ocean observation has grown dramatically over the decade since we first developed it for the NERC SEaOS project. http://biology.st-andrews.ac.uk/seaos/. Animals have provided over 500000 ocean profiles to date. This expansion is set to continue, particularly for polar ocean observations where animal data already contributes well over half the profile data collected over all time.

The amount of ocean data collected by marine mammals continues to grow rapidly and its ease of availability is increasing (see the MEOP URL listed above). Also, the MEOP-CTD database is now directly available on the Ocean Data View (ODV) webpage as an easy-to-use Data Entry at https://odv.awi.de/en/data/ocean/meop_ctd_marine_mammals_database/

Since its first large scale deployment in 2004 (funded in part by the NERC SEaOS grant and with collaborators in France, the US and Australia), this technology has provided a wealth of data from oceans in the polar regions (see Fedak, 2013 (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064512000938 ) and Roquet et al. 2013 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013GL058304/abstract ). The data stream from these tags has continued apace and is becoming increasingly important. It provides information from places and times where there is no other. Output from these tags is provided in near real time to Meteorological community via the GTS and in quality-controlled, post-processed form via the MEOP web site (http://www.meop.net) .The MEOP web site makes over 500,000 ocean profiles freely available to researchers.

&amp;quot;In the past, the vast majority of polar measurements took place in the summer. In recent years, novel techniques such as miniature CTD (conductivity-temperature-depth) tags carried by seals have provided an explosion in year-round measurements in areas largely inaccessible to ships, and, as ice avoidance is added to autonomous profiling floats and gliders, these promise to provide further enhancements to observing systems.&amp;quot; This technology dramatically extends the reach of other ocean observation approaches and is exceptionally cost-effective.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SMRU-IG CTD-SRDL</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.smru.st-andrews.ac.uk/Instrumentation/CTD/</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The basic software design and protocols for CTD-SRDLs were published in Animal Biotelemetry.
