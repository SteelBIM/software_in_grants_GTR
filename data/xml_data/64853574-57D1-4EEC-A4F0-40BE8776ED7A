Law</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L010232/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>There are an estimated 50 million words in the statute book, with 100,000 words added or changed every month. Search engines and services like legislation.gov.uk have transformed access to legislation. No longer the preserve of legal professionals, law is accessed by a much wider group of people, the majority of whom are typically not legally trained or qualified. All users of legislation, from researchers in history, linguistics, lawyers, to a myriad of disciplines, are confronted by the volume of legislation, its piecemeal structure, frequent amendments, and the interaction of the statute book with common law and European law. 

There is a problem. Researchers typically lack the raw data, the tools, and the methods to undertake research across the whole statute book. Arts and humanities researchers are constrained. Meanwhile, the combination of low cost cloud computing, open source software and new methods of data analysis - the enablers of the big data revolution - are transforming research in other fields. 

Big data research is perfectly possible with legislation if only the basic ingredients - the data, the tools and some tried and trusted methods - were as readily available as the computing power and the storage. The vision for this project is to address that gap by providing a new Legislation Data Research Infrastructure at research.legislation.gov.uk. Specifically tailored to researchers' needs, it will consist of downloadable data, online tools for end-users; and open source tools for researchers to download, adapt and use. There has never been a better time for research into the architecture and content of law.

There are three main areas for research:

1.Understanding researchers' needs: to ensure the service is based on evidenced need, capabilities and limitations, putting big data technologies in the hands of non-technical researchers for the first time. 

2.Deriving new open data from closed data: No one has all the data that arts and humanities researchers might find useful in a Legislation Data Research Infrastructure. For example, the potentially personally identifiable data about users and usage of legislation.gov.uk cannot be made available as open data but is perfect for processing using big data tools; eg to identify clusters in legislation or &amp;quot;recommendations&amp;quot; datasets of &amp;quot;people who read Act A or B also looked at Act Y or Z&amp;quot;. The project will look at whether it is possible to create new open data sets from this type of closed data. An N-Grams dataset and appropriate user interface for legislation or related case law, for example, would contain sequences of words/phrases/statistics about their frequency of occurrence per document. N-Grams are useful for research in linguistics or history, and could also be used to provide a predictive text feature in a drafting tool for legislation. 

3.Pattern language for legislation: We need new ways to model the architecture of the statute book if we are to study it using big data. The project will seek to learn from other disciplines, applying the concept of a 'pattern language' to legislation. Pattern languages have revolutionised software engineering over the last twenty years and have the potential to do the same for our understanding of legislation. A pattern language is simply a structured method of describing good design practices, providing a common vocabulary between users and specialists, framed around problems or issues, with a solution. Patterns are not created or invented - they are identified as 'good design' based on evidence about how useful and effective they are. Applied to legislation, this might lead to a common vocabulary between the users of legislation and legislative drafters, to identify more effective drafting practices and design solutions that effect good law. This could also enable a radically different approach to structuring teaching materials or guidance for legislators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Legislators and policy makers 
How: providing a new evidence base to understand how much legislation is currently in force, what legislation is used by people and what courts most often refer to; using the Pattern Language to start to better manage the statute book by viewing it as a networked system rather than separate texts, improving scrutiny of new legislation, benefitting from improvements made by drafters and by having a framework to assess good law. Opportunity to feed into a potential new Interpretation Act in the fifth session of this Parliament.
 
Drafters of legislation
How: providing evidence about what types of pattern in legislative drafting aids/impedes clarity; providing a model for the deeper understanding of the architecture and content of law; improved drafting guidance. Opportunity to feed into a project for a new browser-based drafting tool for legislation. 

Wider public sector
How: Pattern Language provides a bridge between non-legally-trained professionals who currently struggle to understand a complicated, piecemeal, constantly changing statute book, or to understand how the UK statute book interacts with common and European law.

Legal profession and the judiciary
How: providing a clearer understanding of the substantive content of the law and new knowledge that can improve how new laws are made. The legal profession will benefit from an enhanced understanding of: the substantive interrelationships between distinct legislative enactments and their underlying provisions; the relationship between legislative output and judicial output; how the content of the statute book has developed over time and how this has affected the content of the common law; how legislation may be better framed to promote the objects of the legislation and minimise courts' need to interpret ambiguous legislation; how judicial activity affects legislative activity; and how legislation is actually being used. 

Established commercial legal publishers
How: use the data outputs from the project to create new products and services. In the short term, legal publishers will be able to use LDRI outputs to add value to existing products eg applying taxonomy to legislation using machine learning, or optimising search relevance. for example to map the relationship between legislation and case law and to use this knowledge to produce new value added commercial/eductionl/academic products. 

Other businesses
How: Commercial companies will also be able to download the tools and resources available through the LDRI and customise them, to support their own R&amp;amp;D, eg in high growth areas such as automated accountability systems in banking and finance. All businesses will benefit from reducing the burden of compliance and enabling efficiency savings in so far as the project facilitates good law and more effective regulation.

Start-ups
How: Opportunity to develop new and innovative products from new open data provided eg mobile apps (this has already happened with young entrepreneurs using legislation.gov.uk data).

Open data, big data and linked data communities
How: developing methods for creating new open data from closed data that can be applied to other content domains. By being an exemplar, collaborative open data project. Through the wider benefits identified, supporting the evidence base that shows the economic value and impact of open data policies.

General public
How: enhanced user experience when viewing legislation on legislation.gov.uk that better contextualizes the legislation; all citizens will benefit from more accessible legislation in so far as the project facilitates good law and better legislation.

Governments around the world
How: providing an exemplar that others can adapt for their own context, by providing leadership, developing and sharing new ideas that demonstrably lead to better legislation thereby supporting the rule of law.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>451986</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Data Science Community of Interest Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Data Science Community of Interest group</gtr:description><gtr:id>48DBC960-3673-44C9-9236-EE90789A9F75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination; Sharing of expertise; Forums for showcasing the project's work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Dissemination; Sharing of expertise; Forums for showcasing the project's work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Judith Riley, a member of The National Archives' Big Data for Law project team, represents the project on the Data Science Community of Interest Group; a cross-government group that shares best practice on big data research, and showcases Big Data projects across Government.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>LexisNexis UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Lexis Nexis</gtr:description><gtr:id>91B34492-37F8-4695-A281-1E8CF731BEF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Promotion of project aims and ambitions, internally and externally; Contribution to research on the concept of pattern languages; Contribution to the development of indices for the annual census of the statute book; Provision of data.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Lexis Nexis have contributed staff time and expertise, and have embraced the opportunity to collaborate with the Big Data for Law project team.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>John Sheridan presented to over 100 legal editors at Lexis Nexis on 6 June 2014.

We have subsequently developed three personas for the new service: 'Maria Keane', an academic who is very enthusiastic about the possibilities that the legislation data research infrastructure could open up but who need support when it comes to complex data analysis; 'Adam McCann', who works for a government think tank and who has a broad range of interest related to legislation. He wants access to raw data and has all of the skills required to handle complex data analysis; and 'Peter Walker', a lawyer with decades of experience. He wants access to material that will support his arguments, but does not want to access the raw data or carry out complex analysis. Based on this research we are now developing our ideas for the products we will provide through the service (including an annual census of the statute book) and have developed 'wireframes' for the service.

Patterns help policy makers and drafters to design legislation at a higher level of abstraction. This could support policy makers not trained in law to think about what legislative solutions might be available, for example, and improve the delivery of good law.

They have set up a group to develop the patterns and are keen to use them to encapsulate knowledge about good legal design, as well as to aid policy officials to give better instructions.

The conversion of the legislation data on legislation.gov.uk to Akoma Ntsoso has proved the efficacy of this standard sufficiently well that it has now been adopted by the Parliaments and Governments of the UK, and is being used in the new browser based drafting, amending and publishing tool. This in turn has influenced the European Commission who have funded the development of an open source legislation drafting tool (LEOS) through the ISA programme, that uses Akoma Ntoso as a data model.

The Query Builder tool and the Words Explorer tool are being used by legislation drafters, policy makers and practitioners in government to identify, count or measure different aspects of the statute book. The Government Legal Department (SI Hub) are using these tools to identify and measure quality metrics for the drafting of secondary legislation, demonstrating the transformative capability of the new tools in a policy context. The Government Digital Service (GDS) have used the Words Explorer tool to quickly and easily find all of the statutory registers. This provided them with evidence for the 'discovery' phase of their registers initiative, which is now being taken forward as part of the government data programme and the government as a platform agenda. Another part of GDS have used the tools to help provide evidence for a common licensing digital service for the public sector. 

The Word Explorer has been used, as a teaching aid, for post graduate students at the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies to provide empirical evidence for their post-doctoral work. 
The datasets we have created as part of the new research service have helped us to produce a new core reference dataset of legislation, and the recommended use of this dataset is now included in the official guidance on Statutory Instrument Practice provided to the drafters of secondary legislation.

In Europe, we have developed models that will aid the interoperability of UK and EU legislation data, helping researchers to address questions about the impact of EU law on the UK statute book. The findings of the project are to be included in a study for the European Commission on how big data and data analytics offer strategic insight for policy making. The official UK government paper is formally included in the Council and European Council documents, which are made available through its public register. This, and presentations to the European Council E-Law (E-Law) working party ensure that the findings of the project are feeding into future work programmes. 

Research findings are also being used to shape the direction of key open data initiatives, such as the openlaws.eu initiative which aims to help Europe innovate in the legal field; and the UK Administrative Justice Institute (UKAJI), which aims to encourage more research into administrative justice. Legislation patterns relating to the patterns of decision making, discovered through the research, are particularly relevant to the UKAJI.

The findings of the research have also been presented to government and across the civil service - in civil service round tables, briefings to ministers, in evidence to Parliamentary Select Committees and in evidence to the Speaker's Commission on Digital Democracy, demonstrating how the research findings and tools developed can aid better Parliamentary Scrutiny of legislation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B2BBC87B-4272-4B39-8EC1-4815D2DF748C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) We set out to understand researchers' needs from a Legislation Data Research Infrastructure (LDRI). 

We conducted research into users' capabilities to work with legislation data and possible limitations (knowledge, equipment, skills). Through a survey, workshops and one to one interviews, we developed a set of user personas for our new service. These represent archetypal users and informed our proposition, tools and designs. We also tested with users a set of wireframe prototypes of the capabilities we had proposed.

We discovered a significant level of ambition and appetite, from a broad range of research perspectives, to conduct data driven analysis of the statute book as a system. However, the overwhelming majority of researchers were not ready or equipped to make good use of the more sophisticated offering, in terms of data, tools and methods that we originally imagined. We found many potential academic users of the service with interesting research questions but who were not confident in data analysis, statistical methods or using tools to interrogate data. Almost universally researchers lacked the skills and capability to download and work with raw data. These insights transformed our plans for the development of the Legislation Data Research Infrastructure. To address the user needs we uncovered, as well providing the raw data, tools and documented research methods envisaged by the award proposal, we developed a set of pre-packaged data analyses and some powerful but easy-to-use web based tools. These enable researchers to ask complex questions of the statute book and produce robust empirical evidence, without requiring advanced programming or data science skills.

2) We set out to explore deriving new open data from closed data, for example data held by our partners, and to make that available through the LDRI.

The project was fortunate in having excellent commercial and not-for profit partners, with significant data holdings (Lexis Nexis, Thomson Reuters and the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting (ICLR)). We discovered significant interest and appetite to explore big data techniques amongst those holding rich legal data. We also encountered some blockers - in particular regarding access to court judgments. Although this data is owned by the Crown, we were not able to negotiate access to this data from the BAILLI database. 

We wanted to create a new dataset from law reports data supplied to us by ICLR to enable study of the links between case law and statute law. In order to process the law reports data, to identify references or citations to legislation using natural language processing techniques, we first needed to create a gazetteer or list of legislation. The law reports data provided by ICLR was comprehensive with reports dating back to the nineteenth century to the present day. We found none of the project partners had a sufficiently comprehensive and accurate list of legislation to use as the basis of a gazetteer. To address this issue we gathered 21 different dataset lists of legislation, including information held by The National Archives, our partners, and others such as the Parliamentary Archives and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. We also digitised some of the Government owned paper sources of this information, such as the Chronological Tables of Statutes and the discontinued Table of Government Orders. To extract the information we developed a sophisticated technique using a combination of OCR and natural language processing software to facilitate the identification and extraction of the information we required. 

We modelled each source dataset using RDF (a metadata data model). We then created a range of queries for identifying levels of match across the different datasets supplied. To resolve discrepancies we undertook significant additional research, going back to primary sources, such as Statutes of the Realm. This exhaustive process enabled us to refine the resulting data and produce the first truly comprehensive list of primary and secondary legislation enacted or made in the UK. 
The development of a very high quality, validated, core reference dataset of legislation, made available as open data, and maintained by The National Archives as part of legislation.gov.uk, is one of the most important outputs of the research. It will be an invaluable resource for researchers in years to come.

We found there to be significant value is using multiple sources to create high quality core reference data. We also learnt that compiling high quality data from multiple sources involves a significant level of manual editorial work to resolve discrepancies. We found that the flexibility of RDF lends itself to managing this kind of data. The data model (the ontology) for what notionally is a simple dataset, is surprisingly complicated. The resultant dataset also tells the story of the evolution of the law, Parliament and government, over 750 years.

3) We set out to examine the concept of a pattern language for legislation. Our hypothesis was that there are commonly occurring legal design solutions, in legislation, to commonly occurring policy problems. We wanted to identify these patterns as a way of abstracting or mapping the statute book. 

We ran a series workshops with small groups of drafters of legislation from the Parliamentary Counsel offices and the Government Legal Department. As a result of these workshops, and our research we developed an initial catalogue of design patterns in legislation. Our candidate patterns are mainly in the field of public law and can alternatively be thought of patterns of decision making system, in areas of social or economic activity over which the state seeks to exercise a degree of control. Example patterns include the Licensing Pattern, the Regulator Pattern, the Protector Pattern.
We wanted to find a way of expressing the patterns more formerly in terms of legal relationships. To do this we experimented with using Hohfeldian jurisprudence and the Hohfeldian terms to concretely express the patterns. We also experimented with using the Hohfeldian terms as a bridge to finding instances of the patterns. We found that neither traditional search tools nor natural language processing techniques were sufficient to help find instances of a typical pattern in legislation. Often the characteristics of a pattern would involve a set of related provisions, for example in the case of the Licensing Pattern, the creation of an offence and the granting of a power to a public authority to permit a particular activity. To search for instances of these more complex patterns we developed a powerful but easy to use &amp;quot;Query Builder&amp;quot; tool and an associated domain specific query language for legislation. This has the capability to exploit the structure of the legislation data (that Acts are sub-divided into parts, chapters and sections, grouped by cross headings) as part of the search.

The Query Builder tool aided us in finding multiple instances of the patterns. We refined the domain specific query language, to include returning both instances (portions of a piece of legislation) and counts, including counts by year. We have found this more generic capability to be extremely powerful and flexible. We included various options to the tool to deal with some of the complexity of the documents, for example that one piece of legislation amends another. There is a facility to either include or exclude amending texts, or to search only the amending texts. There is also a facility to include or exclude inoperative text (headings etc). We have discovered that a very wide range of questions about the evolution of the statute book can now be expressed and answered using the Query Builder tool.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic researchers:
The Legislation Data Research Infrastructure enables new lines academic enquiry into legislation and the evolution of statute law. By providing raw data as well as easy to use tools, it is truly transformative as an enabler of new types of research. Questions about the volume of legislation, the numbers and nature of powers granted by Parliament to the government, or the types of legal design solution being legislated, can now be rapidly and easily explored. The language of legislation can also be more readily researched. The provision of the data in a wide variety of formats enables the application of other types of analysis to the statute book (e.g. word vector analysis). The tools enable academics from non-computing or non-data orientated backgrounds to conduct this type of research for themselves quickly and easily. The examples we have provided will inspire and stimulate further research questions. The tools are easy enough to be used with undergraduates, as part of a project or assignment, whilst being sophisticated enough to enable entirely new lines of enquiry.

The pattern language provides a new way of analysing the shape and evolution of the statute book. The approach to framing patterns might be refined, new patterns found and new methods of discovering patterns tried.

Policy makers:
The patterns could be used by policy makers to better manage the statute book. By clarifying what legal design solutions are available, policy makers may be able to give more coherent instructions to drafters of legislation. It could be used by drafters to design legislation at a different level of abstraction. The patterns may also be used to aid understanding by readers, making it easier to have a sense of gist. Findings from the research could be used to offer strategic insight into drafting techniques. The data and tools might be used by researchers for MPs and lobbyists to aid better scrutiny of legislation, as well as independent organisations. Both the Institute for Government and the Full Fact organisation have expressed considerable interest in using the capabilities and tools provided by the project. Policy makers from other jurisdictions (there has been significant interest both in Australasia and Europe) may use our findings to catalyse their own domestic research.

Legal professionals:
The legal profession and the judiciary could use the tools and pre-packaged data to gain a clearer understanding of the substantive content of the law and new knowledge that can improve how new laws are made. They could use the Query Builder tool, for example to explore the substantive interrelationships between distinct legislative enactments and their underlying provisions; the relationship between legislative output and judicial output; how the content of the statute book has developed over time and how this has affected the content of the common law; how legislation may be better framed to promote the objects of the legislation and minimise courts' need to interpret ambiguous legislation; how judicial activity affects legislative activity; and how legislation is actually being used.

Commercial:
The data can be used in its own right to underpin high value commercial products and services. The tools we have developed enable various facts to be derived from legislation data much more easily. For example, information about the relationship between UK and EU legislation can be more readily compiled and used to develop commercial products or services around compliance with EU. By making available the data as open data, both start-up innovators as well as traditional legal publishers can use the data or the tools for commercial benefit.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>002514E4-C78F-446B-9FF2-48CFE8A35C45</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://research.legislation.gov.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Use of query builder by senior policy officials in the Northern Ireland government to aid understanding of implications of Brexit</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB7BF48D-B59B-4AB8-B77A-6E48FCB00BD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>John Sheridan briefed senior policy officials in the Northern Ireland government about how they can use the tools developed as part of the Big Data for Law research project to help understand the implications of the UK leaving the EU on Northern Ireland legislation.

The results can also be returned as counts; effectively as observations from slices of a multi-dimensional data cube which conceptually sits above the statute book. These counts form the foundation of the Census of the statute book - pre-packaged data that researchers can link to and use.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2B083AD-D396-4821-AB00-650EF20E3988</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A powerful new tool that enables researchers to ask complex questions of the statute book without needing to learn a programming language. It makes it easy to identify and count or measure different aspects of the statute book - underpinning the Census of the statute book (pre-packaged data that users can link to and use). It revolutionises the research carried out by legal researchers. Framing appropriate queries also generates new datasets, for example enabling powers or offences.

A pattern language is simply a set of design patterns. Each design pattern is framed in terms of a structured method, and generalises a particular good design practice. Pattern languages are most helpful when used to conceptualise and help design or manage large complex systems.
We have reviewed the literature around pattern languages, from architecture and software engineering and design and identified the common characteristics of a pattern language and individual design patterns. In our pattern language for legislation each design pattern consists of four elements: a name, a problem, a solution and the consequences of applying the pattern. We have also identified 'candidate' patterns in legislation, holding workshops with a range of individuals and organisations, ranging from commercial legal publishers to drafters and academics. To formalise the patterns rigorously we are also exploring the use of Hohfeldian jural correlatives.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0223253-543F-4CAA-B0D1-273838FD5B1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Will help to conceptualise and manage a complex system (the statute book).

It is an Ngrams tool (inspired by a tool originally developed by Google and used to explore the occurrence of words across a large database of literature). In parallel we have created a new legislation Ngrams database - opening up the data that enables the large scale production of empirical evidence about the statute book. The tool has the capability to identify larger n-grams by frequency, through querying the data for a smaller n-gram. It was used by the Government Digital Service to identify all the Statutory Registers (searching for 'register of'. This provided essential evidence for the 'discovery' phase of their registers project, which is now being taken forward as part of the government data programme and the 'government as a platform' agenda (see https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/government-as-a-platform.html).</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4904B5E-043A-4804-9C10-458442B2B294</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provision of new data. Provides legal researchers who lack the confidence or skills to work with raw data an easy to use 'starter' tool that allows an immediate exploration of the statute book without requiring technical and statistical expertise. The tool is simple but still produces robust empirical evidence about how our system of statute law is evolving. Without this tool, for example, the Government Digital Service would have found it difficult, if not impossible, to quickly and easily find all of the registers required under statute. With the tool it took a few seconds.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Words Explorer tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Census of the statute book - Our user research revealed that the option many researchers would most like is a set of pre-packaged analyses of the data that they can easily access and use online. To meet this need the new service will provide an online census of the statute book. When most people think of the statute book they think of words rather than numbers, yet the simple act of counting can reveal much about the law, the evolution of policy, politics, history, as well as the evolution of drafting techniques and practice. Imagine, for example, being able to count how many times a legally significant word or phrase has appeared in legislation. What might that reveal about drafting styles and trends? What might counting the number of retrospective provisions reveal? There are so many possibilities and yet so little about the statute book has been measured before. With so many options, the first challenge for the project has been to decide what to count. We tested ideas for core indices with researchers during the user testing. As a result, our annual census will include indices for the number of words, the use of legally significant phrases, the frequency of amendments, the occurrence of internal and external references and the use of powers. An important piece of feedback from the user testing was the need researchers have to know of instances, as well as counts. Users will not only be able to use these indices to discover the numbers, they will also be able to drill down into the instances. So if a word appeared 50 times in a year, for example, the researcher will be able to drill down into the data to find out where those 50 instances were; which specific pieces of legislation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C7EC10D-9F23-4B56-AB82-ED00B1FE5C44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Developing a service that meets users' needs (based on user research)
