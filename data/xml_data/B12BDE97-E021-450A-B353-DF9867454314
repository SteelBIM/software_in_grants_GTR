Interdependencies, tensions and trade-offs between energy, environment and food generate some of the most significant challenges facing humanity in the 21st century. Addressing these at local, national and international scales, the social sciences have the potential to make ground-breaking contributions. But equally important is a process of continuous and deep engagement between the academic and non-academic communities. 

Run by the universities of Sussex, East Anglia and Cambridge, the 'Planetary Connections' Network+ (NW+) aims to engage the social science community with these complex 'Nexus challenges' and link them to research users from business, government and civil society. In order to co-design and deliver research that improves decision making in this critical domain, the NW+ will work through seven parallel work streams: 


1. User Needs Analysis: mapping and building the network.

Initially we will undertake an intense period of user-needs analysis in order to build membership of the NW+. In parallel, we will establish a 'Planetary Connections' NW+ website to widely promote the NW+. We will populate the website with existing articles and frameworks, and short opinion pieces by leading academics. Invitations to join the NW+ will be accompanied by an initial call for dedicated 'think-pieces' to scope nexus challenges and define issues, problems and perspectives.


2. Six thematic workshops on key nexus questions.

We will run a series of two-day workshops on key nexus topics (from September 2014 until April 2016). Each will involve 30-40 participants, drawn from research and user communities, and identified through our network mapping process. Proposed workshop themes include: a) Values and valuation (Sept 2014); b) Ecological thresholds (Feb 2015); c) Resources and conflicts (June 2015); c) Urbanisation at the nexus (Oct 2015); d) Green technologies and transformations (Jan 2016). E) What works at the nexus - from evidence to policy to transformation (April 2016).


3. Annual 'Planetary Connections' conferences.

To enable wider researcher and user participation we will host three annual conferences linked to the themes of the workshops. In January 2017 we will host a larger international conference that will draw together the work of the NW+ and provide a platform for showcasing new ideas, priorities and methods for co-producing research with users to meet global nexus challenges.


4. Data, methods and skills development.

Throughout the course of the NW+ we will develop a suite of methods, as a resource for wider research, policy and practitioner communities. We will produce an NW+ methodology webspace, to give access to a suite of methodological resources including inter alia: methods-focused outputs from each thematic workshop; a wiki space for collaborative design and reflection, a discussion forum, tools and applications and links to wider resources.


5. Small grants and placements scheme.

The NW+ will administer a series of small project grants (linked to the thematic workshops) in order to contribute essential ideas, empirical applications and practical research-user engagement to the NW+, and an ongoing placement scheme in order to support knowledge exchange and provide enhanced understanding of real world scenarios. 


6. Rapid-response 'strategy labs'. 

To engage researchers, users and decision-makers in emerging issues, NW+ will convene up to 5 'strategy labs'. Each will focus on a particular, hot, controversial policy topic that highlights nexus issues and trade-offs at a given moment. This will ensure that the NW+ is able to respond in a flexible and timely matter as policy challenges arise. 


7. Analysis, synthesis and strategic advice.

Throughout the project, the NW+ team will provide strategic analysis, synthesis and advice to the ESRC, Research Councils, Technology Strategy Board, BIS and GO-Science and other key organisations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Achieving a lasting impact is fundamental to the NW+. This requires facilitating the deep and on-going engagement of academic and non-academic communities, working to address the complex set of challenges that cut across the Energy/Environment/Food Nexus. From the outset, we will embed impact, communications and engagement strategies within each of the seven work streams of the NW+. At an early stage we will work to identify demand among participants for particular outputs and activities, and by mapping potential pathways to impact. Using the STEPS Centre's adaptation of the Participatory Impact Pathways Analysis (PIPA) method, we will take a systematic strategic approach to building robust and lasting communities of knowledge and practice and inspiring positive behaviour change.

Who will benefit from this network?

The NW+ will engage a broad range of non-academic beneficiaries, particularly in business, policy and civil society circles working on Nexus issues. These beneficiaries are envisaged to include inter alia business leaders, scientific advisors, civil servants, MPs and special advisors, civil society organisations and charities, learned societies and the media across local, national and international scales. The NW+ will actively seek out these potential users and beneficiaries, interacting with them through a range of channels to ensure that research addresses questions of relevance to them, and providing them with access to research results in accessible and applicable formats. 

How will they benefit from this network?

In addition to providing long term benefits to participants and society more broadly (i.e. through improved business, policy maker and other research users' decision-making), the NW+ will produce a wide range of tangible benefits to participants, in the form of high-quality user focused outputs. These will include: accessible policy briefs; synthesized evidence reports; a portfolio of open access publications; evidence-based case studies; a regular newsletter and regular publication of research outputs via social and web-based channels such as a blog, Twitter feed, Flickr, regular YouTube contributions and Slideshare.
Another significant benefit of the network will result from participant engagement in the six NW+ thematic workshops on key Nexus questions; the NW+ annual conferences; 'strategy labs' on emerging topics, and through the grants and placement opportunities. 

NW+ participants and the wider academic research, policy and practitioner communities will also benefit from the NW+ methodology webspace, which will give access to a suite of methods developed as part of the NW+. The methodology webspace will consist of, inter alia: methods-focused outputs from each thematic workshop; methodological write-ups from the small grants scheme; a wiki space for collaborative design and reflection, a discussion forum, tools and applications and links to wider resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1529045</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introduction to Session on Stoking the Anthropocene</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3EABB066-B897-4404-B8F8-39556A2A4A19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint conference of the European Assocaition for Social Studies of Science and Technology and the Society for the Social Studies of Science, Barcelona Conference Centre, Barcelona

The workshop was led by the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership and brought a particular focus on the role of business in dealing with nexus challenges.

The workshop, which took place in Cambridge over two days, explored the business risks related to land use, food, water, energy and the environment through a mix of interactive sessions to inspire business led action underpinned by research.

The event accommodated a broad mix of 40 people, with half representing the private sector and half from academia. We witnessed a real combination of minds that crossed the business-academia divide and broke down multi-sector and disciplinary boundaries. Fruitful discussions often yielded more questions than answers but these can stimulate future research ideas and encourage funding into areas that are impactful for business.

In doing so the session aimed to open up alternatives to closed, instrumental views of 'nexus thinking' that privilege techno-fixes over movements for social justice. The session posed the framing of the nexus as a democratic process of deliberation and struggle aimed at furthering the voices (and interests) of the most marginalized and vulnerable sections in society. The abstract follows: 'Nexus challenges cannot be separated from the perceptions, interests, and practices of different actors associated with a nexus (Stein et al., 2014). But by broadening out and opening up nexus-related methods and methodologies, researchers and policy analysts may at the same time hope to achieve greater scientific rigour and societal accountability (Stirling, 2015). Recognition of situated 'nexuses', (e.g. urban nexuses), point to the need for reflexive inter- and trans-disciplinary perspectives that bring together diverse insights and mend tools from beyond the social sciences, humanities and the natural sciences. Indeed, attendant moves to transdisciplinary research requires democratic encounter between a range of researchers and practitioners who can work together to produce valuable knowledge (Harris and Lyon, 2014). These emergent strands of research offer the prospect of nexus thinking as a democratic process by which to address social and environmental challenges thrown up by interlinkages between food, water and energy domains. Democracy is not an end point but the process through which power can be afforded to those outside the realm of influence. Nexus-related challenges can then be constructed to empower initiatives for genuine social progress, rather than the solving of urgent, top-down assertions of catastrophic technical fears. And nexus thinking then becomes a process of equal exchange between disciplines, where scientists and citizens participate together in discussion and decision-making'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://conference.rgs.org/AC2016/19</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Uncertainties About &quot;Impacts&quot;: personal reflections from collective effort to make a difference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AF38743-4256-4C35-A614-1CB8C196811B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to conference on 'Uncertainty and Impact in the Researching of Science, Technology and Innovation'

The workshop was structured around the following questions: 1) What are the on-the-ground challenges of integration across food, water, energy, climate etc. across diverse political and geographical scales? How is nexus thinking being picked up in bureaucracies, institutions and scientific bodies, especially in the global South where capacity to deal with data/ knowledge challenges can be limited? 2) Can 'nexus thinking' be used to achieve social justice in resource management? 35 participants attended from the UK, other European countries and South Africa.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thenexusnetwork.org/events/the-nexus-resource-conflicts-and-social-justice-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Case For Unilateral Nuclear Disarmament</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8189FBBB-6919-4E08-AB40-36FD1123DD69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to Debate on UK Nuclear Disarmament at the UCL Debating Society

The South Asia Sustainability Hub &amp;amp; Knowledge Network was launched on 28 Jan 2016 at the India International Centre. The hub aims to develop a network of institutions and people committed to exploring pathways to sustainability in South Asia and is part of the STEPS Pathways to Sustainability Global Consortium.A related workshop on Climate Change and Uncertainty from Above and Below was held on 27-28 January 2016. This workshop explored issues around 'does the focus on climate change models, diagrams, regressions and future scenarios (theorizing by experts from 'above') factor in the realities of how local people live with, understand and cope with uncertainty in everyday settings (from 'below')?'.On 29-30 January 2016 the International Conference on Pathways to Sustainable Urbanisation was held at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, India. Whilst urbanisation brings the creation of new opportunities for some, it can also pose enormous challenges for poor and marginalised citizens in cities and in peri-urban areas.
The conference was organised by the South Asia Sustainability Hub &amp;amp; Knowledge Network (SASH&amp;amp;KN) through direct collaboration with the STEPS Centre, a partner in the Nexus Network. &amp;nbsp;SASH&amp;amp;KN is the South Asia hub of the STEPS Pathways to Sustainability Global Consortium.

The workshop took a critical look the research challenge in addressing nexus issues. In light of growing challenges in the just, equitable and sustainable global provision of water, food and energy and the complexity of the interactions between these vital systems (the challenges of 'the Nexus'), participants in the workshop were encouraged to consider the following key questions:
-What different kinds and interconnections of method in contrasting contexts, form the most practical basis for enabling transformative action to address Nexus challenges?
-How can such encompassing Nexus methodologies best enable academic, government, business and civil society actors to develop appropriate skills, training and research capabilities?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thenexusnetwork.org/events/transdisciplinary-methods-for-developing-nexus-capabilities-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A View of Science and Technology Studies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CB788115-834C-49D2-8A2F-D86A7D39D720</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to panel discussion, DPhil Day

Participants reflected on the contribution that different social science perspectives might make in understanding urban nexuses, and how social scientists might effectively participate in inter- and trans-disciplinary initiatives, and considered what kind of policy mechanisms and events might support the pursuit of the partnerships that may be required for developing new understandings. The workshop was structured around the following orienting questions:
1. What divergent framings and understandings of 'urban nexuses' are emerging and why are they important, in what ways and to whom?
2. What are the implications of these understandings and their foci for governance of nexus interactions by public, private and hybrid arrangements?
3. What implications do these understandings hold for political-economic action by, and for alliances between, civil society organizations, businesses and social movements striving for sustainability and justice?
4. What kind of relations (inter- and trans-disciplinary alliances, engagements with the material world) underpin the making of the emerging understandings of 'urban nexuses'?
5. What new inter- and trans-disciplinary approaches (and concepts) do we need to further understand interactions at 'urban nexuses', including the interdependent vulnerabilities associated with access to food, water and energy in cities?

At all levels of government, the ecosystem of institutions and individuals engaged in expert advice and evidence-informed policymaking is more diverse than ever before. Distinct yet overlapping communities of research, policy and practice are congregating around a core set of questions about how to improve the provision, communication, relevance and application of evidence to policymaking.

Perspectives from the natural sciences and engineering are being enriched and complicated by a deeper understanding of public values, cognitive biases and political psychology from the social, political and behavioural sciences. The assumptions of those on the evidence &amp;quot;supply side&amp;quot; are increasingly tempered by pragmatic insights that come from experience on the &amp;quot;demand side&amp;quot; of policy institutions. Yet despite these positive developments, it is easy to feel frustrated by the visible failures of evidence to influence policy in so many areas.

On thorny issues - exemplified by the food-water-energy nexus - the response to overwhelming evidence is often sluggish and incremental. Populist politicians or social media warriors can tap into the anxieties caused by globalisation, and channel these towards resentment, as we saw in the claims during the Brexit referendum that &amp;quot;people in this country have had enough of experts&amp;quot;. Such tensions aren't new, but they are becoming more visible, reflecting what some have called the &amp;quot;paradox of scientific authority&amp;quot;.

Expert advice is being sought with growing urgency across a proliferating array of policy and public questions. At the same time, and often on the same issues, the legitimacy of evidence and expertise has rarely been so fiercely contested. So these are interesting times to be a policy-engaged sustainability researcher. In the UK, these challenges are exacerbated by reforms to the policy and research funding landscape, which are creating new uncertainties - and possibilities - for those looking to engage and influence decision making.

Drawing on insights from his role as director of the ESRC's Nexus Network, and vice-chair of the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA), James Wilsdon will reflect on how the landscape for transdisciplinary, policy-engaged research is changing, and what opportunities may emerge through the Global Challenges Research Fund, reforms to the Research Excellence Framework and the creation of UK Research and Innovation.

This talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

Over three years, the network has:
? Hosted and facilitated numerous events, providing spaces for engagement and discussion about nexus challenges;
? Fostered online awareness and debate, through our website and social media;
? Developed insights into tools and methodologies for nexus thinking and practice;
? Pump-primed and supported nexus-related research through a flexible small grants programme and fellowship scheme;
? Worked with businesses and policymakers to support them to address nexus interdependencies, opportunities and impacts;
? Built capacity in the UK research system for future investments in nexus-related economic, environmental and sustainability research;
? Provided strategic advice to ESRC, RCUK and other funding bodies.

In more detail, the Nexus Network has shown that transdisciplinary research requires working beyond one's usual theoretical and methodological comfort zones, and highlights the diversity of ways to understand problems. The project has illustrated the importance of getting users involved as co-producers in the design of research projects. Our key findings/recommendations, as outlined in our report published on 16th March 2017, are as follows:
Creating spaces for transdisciplinary engagement 
? The flexible terminology of &amp;quot;the nexus&amp;quot; is useful as a convening mechanism to link disparate disciplines and perspectives, and highlight interconnections;
? Facilitating transdisciplinary engagement is often messy, expensive, and takes time. End points may not be as envisaged at the outset. It requires patient, flexible investment;
? Creating spaces and trading zones for engagement is crucial for transdisciplinary conversations and collaborations;
? Thematic events are a fruitful way of garnering interest in an event from a wide range of people beyond academia. However, incentives to attend such events are limited for many stakeholders, unless such events are linked to clear outcomes (e.g. policy, business or research funding impact);
? Innovative formats for events should be encouraged in order to stimulate creative thinking and diminish the hierarchies or boardroom dynamics that can be associated with more traditional formats.
Methods, skills and capacity building 
? &amp;quot;Nexus-thinking&amp;quot; may have utility beyond food, energy and water. However there is a danger that a buzzword of this sort is able to obscure or &amp;quot;render technical&amp;quot; issues, which are at their core, social and political, rather than technical and managerial. To avoid this pitfall, it is important that critical approaches are supported, which highlight the political nature of these challenges;
? There's no such thing as a &amp;quot;nexus method&amp;quot;, but a diverse range of methodological approaches can help to illuminate the complexity of nexus interactions, and facilitate transdisciplinary engagement in research and practice;
? The distinction between qualitative and quantitative methodologies is only one dimension of epistemic culture, and methodologies can be usefully mapped according to multiple dimensions;
? There are strong pressures for certain kinds of knowledge production which leave their imprint in knowledge practices;
? Methodological approaches are required which go beyond simple integration or &amp;quot;joined up thinking&amp;quot; to question power dynamics and facilitate transformation.

Funding transdisciplinary research
? There is a clear demand for smaller, flexible grants of &amp;pound;5K- 150k (currently a gap in UK research council funding). This is especially crucial for early-career researchers;
? Flexibility in grant giving is key to supporting creative approaches - e.g. funding non-traditional partners (such as NGOs) or awarding short fellowships to support work that doesn't fit into a conventional project model;
? It is important to provide funding for the processes of co-design of research: putting together bids is complex and time-consuming, particularly if non-academic partners are involved;
? Efforts to bridge disciplines &amp;amp; sectors require trust. This takes time to build, and patient investment is needed if relationships are to be incentivised and sustained. 
Engaging stakeholders in transdisciplinary research
? Business participation in transdisciplinary research remains unusual: academics do not necessarily have the networks nor the experience to work productively with time-poor executives;
? One starting point is to bring business practitioners and researchers together to co-design research questions, and agree priorities and ways of working together (as we did with the Nexus2020 project);
? Placing the user at the heart of the research process can give researchers the opportunity to study fundamental questions while delivering nearer-term value to companies or policymakers;
? User-centric multidisciplinary research has the potential to influence policy, business practices, and in some cases commercial strategy, with positive effects on nexus challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work is ongoing but our findings so far are summarised in the March 2017 report, which is publicly available at the URL listed above.
