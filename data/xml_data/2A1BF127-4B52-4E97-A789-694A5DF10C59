Recognition of this resulted in funders of flood risk management in the UK pooling resources to jointly fund the Flood Risk Management Research Consortium (FRMRC), from 2004 until 2012. The consortium was charged with establishing a programme of high quality science to enhance understanding of flooding and improve society's ability to reduce flood risk. This initiative enabled the agencies responsible for FCERM in the UK to actively engage with the university research community in a manner that facilitated the successful uptake of improved scientific and engineering techniques in support of flood risk management practice. In anticipation of the end of FRMRC the Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) Partnership developed and published its UK Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Strategy in 2011. To provide investment in this strategy the EPSRC held an &amp;quot;Innovative Solutions to Flood Risk&amp;quot; sandpit. The outcome of which was the award of three new grants supporting innovation in flood risk management. The purpose of the Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Network (FCERM_Net) is to support the LWEC strategy by providing a co-ordinating activity for the EPSRC investment through the facilitation of interaction between the research and user communities to aid the translation and uptake of the research, identifying emerging research gaps and encouraging the development of new research proposals to bridge these gaps.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is a clear mapping from the aims and objectives of the current portfolio of EPSRC flood and coastal erosion sandpit grants and research priorities identified in the LWEC UK Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Research Strategy. An important role of the Network is therefore to maintain this &amp;quot;line of sight&amp;quot; from the planned research to the needs of the research users. This will be achieved through the co-ordination of knowledge exchange and dissemination activities that add value to those planned by the individual investigators. For example, (i) the website, bi-annual newsletter and news items in selected professional newsletters will raise general awareness of the research, (ii) themed technical meetings, webinars and fact sheets will provide technical detail of the relevance of the research to research users, and, (iii) the participation of EA/Defra Theme Advisory Groups (covering England and Wales) and the Centre for Expertise in Waters (covering Scotland). The involvement of these organisations in Network steering and meetings will facilitate the identification of research topics that have achieved sufficient level of maturity to justify further development to proof of concept stage prior to implementation in practice. Additionally, the reports to be authored following each Assembly will be designed to advise research users on progress towards these objectives and allow forward planning of any follow on work they will be required to undertake to translate the research outcomes into usable products and tools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157582</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Water Resources Association (IWRA) World Water Congress (2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D16E8FE6-5163-401F-9FC1-190E9FFE8326</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of a contribution to the Worl Water Congress in 2015, the Network delivered a full conference session on Flood Risk Management, inviting international speakers to keynote, and share experiences from their perspective, as well as inviting contributions from the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Professional practitioners and researchers from across the UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.iwra.org/congress/2015/special-sessions/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FCERM.net Annual Assembly (2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B499657C-D2A6-4C16-AC12-3CDF2124B3E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management Network (FCERM.net) Annual Assembly took place in May 2015.

The programme included research presentations from on-going EPRSC projects, input from colleagues at CREW and DEFRA, a breakout session on the theme of dissemination for impact, and closed with forward-looking presentations on new project ideas. 

A key workshop was delivered at the event that explored the idea of moving away from one-way 'dissemination' towards a model of engagement and co-creation.

It aimed to bring together a diverse range of professionals from across the Flood Risk Management sector, as well as those working in related disciplines. The event had five key objectives: 
? Share information about on-going research in FCERM and identify knowledge gaps
? Develop a dialogue between researchers and research users
? Create opportunities for networking and building community 
? Actively encourage the development of novel research ideas (driven by user/sector needs)
? Provide support and encourage development of research students and early career researchers in FCERM
 
The event aspired to be open and inclusive to anyone working within, or indeed, interested in Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management and was marketed using a number of different approaches including: 

1. Distribution Lists (FCERM Network list, LWEC distribution list and ESRC distribution list
2. Through other networks (ARRC, ICE, IAHR, GESA)
3. Social Media - twitter and Linked-In total 108 delegates registered for the event, with 101 attending on the day. 

Format of the Event
The programme was designed to launch the FCERM Network and provide delegates with a clear vision of the network's aims and objectives, as well as providing opportunities for contributions, knowledge sharing and progress reports from both academia and other FRM professionals. The day began with an introduction from Garry Pender, who officially launched the network and provided an overview of the network aims and discussed the strategy for achieving these. Project overviews and updates were presented by the PI's of the 3 EPSRC sandpit projects on FLOODMemory , Blue-Green Cities and SESAME (Chris Kilsby, Colin Thorne, and Graham Coates, respectively). These were followed by presentations from professionals working across the sector including Stefan Laeger (Environment Agency), Jeremy Benn (JBA Consulting) and John Hillier, Loughborough University. An event programme is provided in Appendix A.

Given the network's objectives of being inclusive and interdisciplinary, providing networking opportunities, and highlighting gaps in research to facilitate collaboration, the afternoon and early evening was dedicated to meeting these objectives in the following ways:
1. A special session was dedicated to looking at FRM from the perspective of another discipline. This 'Guest Spotlight' presentation was delivered by Virginia Murray, Public Health England and explored the relationship between flooding and health. 
2. An informal drinks reception in the early evening aimed at providing delegates with opportunities to make connections, follow up on questions from presentations or make new contacts.
3. A final session used the LWEC research strategy to help map current and on-going research activities, as well as identifying gaps and topical/timely needs or research interests.
Finally time was allotted to enable delegates to complete evaluation forms. It was emphasised that this was a primary mechanism for members of the Network to share their ideas about what they would like from the Network. 

A major outcome from the breakout sessions was 3 new interdisciplinary research proposals</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fcerm.net/resource/reality-approach-flood-risk-management-research</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Web-based engagement - Blogs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A202BBE-F33B-4301-8238-576E3FBCC5F0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Network has a website that acts as a central hub for our communcations and engagement (detailed elsewhere). As part of our communication strategy, a key objective was to reach out beyond our technical researchers and practitioners and appeal to a broader audience (local authorities, flood action groups, the media, students, and other interest groups). The blogs were designed to achieve this by being purposefully brief, to identify a perspective on a 'hot topic' and key issues related to this (rather than reporting on a project and methdology) and specifically requests authors not to use subject-specific 'exclusive' jargon or terminolgy.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fcerm.net/blogs</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sharing Best Practice in Research Dissemination</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2813A3B7-08AF-4D47-9568-0395B7F2B152</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop designed in collaboration with Sniffer for the FCERM.net Annual Assembly at the mid-way point of the Network's funding (and mid-way through 3 sandpit research projects associated with FCERM.net). The workshop was delivered at this time to provide support to research teams at the mid-stage of ther research to encourage increased engagement with 'receptors' or 'users' of their research and to encourage collaboartion between experts in industry and research teams. There was an emphasis on thinking about the 'useability, applicability and usefulness' of the research and researchers were encouraged to explore this with industy experts at the event. There was also a deeper exploration of what 'dissemination of research' looks like and a push towards engagement and co-creation rather than one-way transmission of outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.fcerm.net/IntoPractice</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation: Raising profile of FCERM.net at a National Flood Risk Management Conference (2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB59132D-498D-48CC-9C98-AF468FA5602E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation was delivered at the National Flood Risk Management Conference (2015).
