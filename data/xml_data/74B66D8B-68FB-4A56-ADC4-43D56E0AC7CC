economy</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005320/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Cultural intermediation is a process which connects different kinds of communities into the creative economy and wider society. It plays a critical role in raising aspirations, upskilling and building confidence, all of which are vital to allow people to engage with and benefit from one of the most dynamic sectors of the contemporary UK economy.

Individual artists, professional networks, events, festivals, commissioning bodies, creative businesses, arts and cultural organisations both large and small can all play intermediary roles. Some of the most exciting opportunities for research in this area are occurring in the city regions. In part this is because of their size and multiplicity of cultural resources, but also because these areas have large concentrations of communities suffering multiple deprivation who are being left behind by the post-industrial creative economy.

Investigations undertaken as part of developing this research project revealed that those individuals and organisations undertaking cultural intermediation are coming under significant pressure. Public sector funding cuts and a new agenda of localism are changing the relationship that intermediaries have with the state, requiring a reappraisal of their activities. The 'Big Society' agenda places an emphasis on community-led activities at the same time that the institutional support for capacity building in those communities through cultural intermediation is being squeezed. The creative sector is itself highly fragmented with weak connections between different sectors, different communities and policy processes. So-called 'hard-to-reach' communities remain disconnected, suffering multiple deprivation, social disenfranchisement and exclusion.

Acknowledging the importance of cultural intermediation, the research asks to what extent these processes meet the needs of urban communities in the 21st century and how they might operate more effectively. The aim of the research is to discover how the value of cultural intermediation can be captured and how this activity can be enhanced to create more effective connection between communities and the creative economy. The objectives of the research are to: create new ways of measuring value; analyse the historic development of cultural intermediation to inform current practice; examine how intermediation fits within the existing policy landscape and the governance of relations between the different actors; explore the effectiveness of intermediation activity from a community perspective; design new forms of intermediation through a series of practice-based interventions; and reflect on the process of working across and between disciplines and sectors in order to enhance practice.

The research has a number of key applications and wider benefits. In providing a means to capture the value of intermediation, policy makers and practitioners will be able to foster better practice. This is of particular importance given the shifts in the governance and funding landscape, particularly within the public sector. The historical material, will provide a crucial evidence base situating understandings of intermediation, providing lessons to current practitioners. Those creative intermediaries directly involved in the interventions will receive training in research methods in order to analyse and improve their own practice. A subsequent 'how-to' research guide will disseminate these lessons more widely. Academically the research will make a major contribution to debates on: creativity and valuation; the historical evolution of the creative economy; governance and localism; practice-based methods; interdisciplinarity and epistemic communities; and the role of culture in connecting communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have impact across a number of sectors including policymakers, cultural intermediaries, arts practitioners, communities, creative businesses and academics.

The mapping and valuation work (WP1) will be of direct benefit to DCMS as well as regional and local policy makers. DCMS have already commissioned work on modes of valuing the creative economy and a specific analysis of intermediation will be of particular use, feeding into debates on the most effective use of public resources in order to maximise the engagement of communities in the creative economy. This will tie into the analysis of cultural policy and governance at the local scale (WP3) which will produce reports looking at best practice in joining up different activities across the sector in order to produce more effective modes of working. This will benefit not only national and local policymakers (including direct engagement with Manchester and Birmingham City Councils) but also those working within cultural intermediation to enhance integration with policy networks.

The historical work (WP2) and creative interventions (WP5) will produce outputs which will directly benefit Birmingham Museums and Art Galleries, the Library of Birmingham and Manchester International Festival through a series of installations based on multi-touch tables. In the first two cases this will provide content to populate existing investment in this technology as part of the ERDF-funded Digital Demonstrator project at the University of Birmingham. The development of this multiplatform technology (WP6) will also form a significant output in its own right, providing a model for museums/galleries/businesses to scale content across web/mobile/touch-table for a more immersive experience.

The intervention practices (WP5) will be artistic outputs in their own right to be engaged with by a general audience, but they will have significant additional benefits. By providing training to cultural intermediaries to undertake research - and producing a best practice guide for the wider sector - different creative organisations and individual artists will gain skills to undertake critical review of their own practice. Through collaboration with a-n the Artists' Information Company, there is a clear route for disseminating these lessons across a wide community of practitioners. This is complimented by training community researchers (WP4) to examine the ways in which cultural intermediation has impacted on their lives. This will have direct benefit to those trained in terms of upskilling, confidence building and direct engagement in developing new modes of working to improve community engagement in these activities. 

By feeding into the research process as stakeholders on the Steering Group, Virtual Panel and local panels, practitioners and policymakers will help to shape the research to address specific areas of need within their areas of interest. In addition, membership of these groups will represent significant networking opportunities and capacity building for participants, particularly in terms of engaging with the HE sector. 

The seminar and pamphlet series will ensure that a range of practitioners, policymakers, community groups and academic stakeholders are engaged with the practical and theoretical lessons delivered by the research. A process of reflecting on the research project, its modes of knowledge exchange and epistemic communities will improve the quality of this engagement and provide lessons for improving future practice in interdisciplinary working across and beyond the HE sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1232746</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a film made from footage recorded as part of the AHRC Connected Communities Festival 2014.

A series of cultural intermediaries in both Ordsall (Salford) and Balsall Heath (Birmingham) engaged with this element of the project, in order to explore how their activities could be adapted to produce projects directly responding to community aspirations for cultural activities. Reflections on the Ordsall Method have been published as a policy report by Symonds and Perry (2016). This built on a series of workshops with intermediaries in Salford about the opportunities for engaging communities in developing their own cultural projects and exploring how these collaborative projects might be realised within the current funding structures. Intermediaries have thus been drawn into a series of reflections about their own practices in terms of how their aspirations and those of communities can be aligned and the extent to which collaboration between different intermediaries operating at the neighbourhood scale can be enhanced.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>229F83DC-6202-4CD5-B141-ADBC7A2DC917</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cultural forms can play instrumental roles, going beyond being mere aesthetics, to playing an active role in reforming society. This instrumental role has always been present within cultural activity, but over the last 30 years, particularly in western economies, the instrumental value of culture has been increasingly emphasised. Culture has become valued for what it does. Where the instrumental role of culture is discussed in relation to community, there tends to be a focus on issues around social inclusion, or, perhaps more positively, on inspiring individuals to engage with creative practice as a first step toward involvement in the creative economy. Communities that do not engage with these instrumental uses of culture are seen as somehow lacking, problematic and in need of some form of intervention. 
This project examined 'cultural intermediation' - the process of connecting communities into the activities of the wider cultural and creative economy. We explored the policy and social frames through which citizens and wider communities are being engaged with culture as a tool to mitigate the effects of social exclusion and deprivation. The study was based on a four-year investigation of those individuals and organisations whose mission is to use culture, instrumentally, to help deprived communities in a variety of different ways. The research was undertaken during a period of quite dramatic change in policy and governance within the UK's cultural sector. These changes were driven by one of the biggest experiments in refiguring the role of the public sector within the UK since 1945, as post-credit crunch governments have responded to the challenges of a struggling global economy by employing the discourse of 'austerity'. What has emerged is a cultural intermediation sector that has refined its practices, adopting new funding models and arenas of activity. Doubtless, the changing funding landscape has done a great deal of damage, with organisations closing and activities being reduced. There are, however, examples of highly innovative practice that have emerged since the financial crisis, from which important lessons should be drawn for the future effectiveness of cultural intermediation as a sector dedicated to improving people's lives through cultural engagement.
The key findings of the project were:
1) Economic activity within the broadly defined cultural intermediation sector is disproportionately concentrated in London. This replicates the well-established concentration of arts/cultural spending and creative economic activity in the capital. As a result the power of cultural intermediation to overcome social exclusion is stymied by reproducing an existing set of geographic inequalities concentrating wealth and opportunity in south-east England. (working paper by De Propris &amp;amp; Mwara, 2013). This can be seen in parallel with work indicating that the creative industries more generally have high social class barriers to entry, meaning that socially excluded communities are much less likely to benefit from engagement with the sector (peer reviewed paper by O'Brien et al. 2016)
2) That intermediation activities have a long history but have been hollowed out by public sector cuts. A case study of documentary photography illustrated historic tensions between the priorities and timescales of the arts-funding sector and capacity for commercialisation. (peer reviewed paper by Grosvenor &amp;amp; Macnab, 2015)
3) That funding structures in the public sector continue to work counter to the rhythms of creative production. New public management in the contemporary public sector has put considerable strain on creative organisations both in terms of how funding is applied for and in reporting requirements of grant-funded activity. The complexity of this audit culture means that the benefit/cost ratio of public funding is tipping increasingly toward organisations curtailing certain activities as too much time is taken up on managing projects rather than actually engaging with communities (peer reviewed paper by Jones &amp;amp; Warren 2016). In parallel, the ways in which policymakers deploy the creative/cultural economy frequently pulls those working in the sector away from their aesthetic/community engagement missions (peer reviewed paper by Symons, 2016).
4) That the intermediation sector continues to play a vital role in engaging communities with cultural activity, but that funding cuts since 2010 have made it increasingly difficult to play that 'big society' role (peer reviewed paper by Perry et al. 2015). Nonetheless, reflection by practitioners shows that there has been considerable innovation in the sector attempting to adapt to the changing funding landscape and priorities (working paper, YV Jones, 2015).
5) That the record and legacy of intermediation activity can be relatively difficult to uncover as time passes. In part this can be as public art projects lose their meanings and/or are damaged or destroyed (paper by Long, 2014). Conventional ethnographic and arts-based techniques can be a productive means of accessing the folk memory of intermediation activity (peer reviewed paper by Jones &amp;amp; Jam, 2016), but there can be problems with certain techniques in some communities. The use of walking interview techniques to explore how communities are engaged with their neighbourhoods can be deeply problematic when used with people who have limited mobility for cultural reasons (peer reviewed paper by Warren, 2016).
6) Processes of handing power down to communities, which has been central to the UK's Localism agenda, is completely reliant on intermediaries facilitating that process. Experiments in community cultural budgeting undertaken as part of the research project demonstrated the crucial role of cultural intermediaries to provide support (both practical and emotional) to community members seeking to realise their vision for cultural activity within the neighbourhood (outputs relating to this are being written at the time of producing this report).
Innovation in the sector is allowing intermediaries to adapt to a changing policy and funding landscape, but creativity and culture cannot be seen as a magic bullet; entrenched problems of structural inequality and social exclusion cannot be solved by the activities of cultural intermediaries alone. Nonetheless, this research has demonstrated that the sector has a valuable role to play in mitigating some of the worst effects of neoliberal abandonment of communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research raises significant questions about the distribution of public funding around culture and also whether that resource is being spent in the most effective way.

The platform is based on CSV tagging of images with particular themes and content which is then used to generate an interactive display around the themes within the data users have inputted into the software.
