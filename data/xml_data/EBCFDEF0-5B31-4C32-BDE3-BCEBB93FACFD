This was performed using X-ray microtomography (XMT or micro-CT) with advanced visualisation and modelling techniques and held the promise to historians and archivists of gleaning information from hitherto inaccessible texts in delicate and damaged documents. But although it caused quite a stir at the time, against the harsh realities of X-ray photon statistics and the characteristics of real materials, that promise failed to deliver and today the promise has receded. The stumbling block, hindering progression beyond proof of concept, is the conceptually simple step of increasing the XMT scanner performance (particularly contrast ratio) beyond the reach of commercial or even research XMT systems. What is conceptually a small step actually requires a technological leap in imaging methodology, involving entirely new modalities in data acquisition, reconstruction and processing. With a unique track record in this specialist area of development, we have the capability of delivering the necessary imaging hardware and analysis software to revive this exciting application and make the dream of 'reading the unreadable' a reality.Just as the term high definition in television refers to the screen dimension in terms of pixel numbers rather than physical size, so in XMT we use this term to describe the imaged volume dimensions in voxels, irrespective of resolution. The problem is that as the definition increases, so the detector elements must become smaller and the contrast ratio in the projections must increase. The combination of these two requirements gives a fourth order relationship between definition and required X-ray exposure. Furthermore, increasing the definition increases the susceptibility to systematic errors that give rise to ring and other image artefacts, creating problems even for synchrotron XMT systems (limiting attainable contrast resolution even with ring artefact reduction techniques). The QMUL group is already leading the way with high definition XMT scanners which are currently the only ones to employ moving time-delay integration cameras for ring artefact elimination and field size extension. We thus already have the ability to resolve ink in historical parchment samples much larger than the test samples previously demonstrated.The Cardiff group have been analysing and imaging historical artefacts in conjunction with the major archives in the UK; building excellent collaborations /and trust- between fundamental scientists and experts in conservation and curation. Their research has focussed on the degradation of parchment, which leads to fragility and ultimately to the need for virtual unrolling with the proposed facility. The Cardiff team is already working with experts in high performance computing on code parallelisation for X-ray diffraction analysis. They will develop a suite of 3D image processing tools that can be used to extract information from a wide variety of document types with varying degrees of damage and deformation. This will cover anisotropic noise filtering to aid identification of the ink containing layer of the medium, surface identification, volume rendering (visualisation of the parchment surface and mapping to two dimensions) and 2D image processing to improve text clarity. As this software is being developed, the QMUL group will develop an advanced equiangular TDI XMT scanner with extended field size and ultra-high contrast resolution, capable of imaging whole documents. The archivists will work with us to identify historical documents amenable to this scanning method and at the culmination of this project, all the groups will work closely together to produce the first real world results. This will be a milestone in historical information recovery that will foster interest throughout the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>785724</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Norfolk Record Office</gtr:department><gtr:description>Norfolk Records Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>564C37A3-F1DF-497B-9EA8-78DAB48D2861</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BBC The One Show.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They were enthusiastic about our project; we were able to describe the capabilities of our system so that they could search their archive for appropriate material.

Pioneering X-ray technology is making it possible to read fragile rolled-up historical documents for the first time in centuries.



Old parchment is often extremely dry and liable to crack and crumble if any attempt is made to physically unroll or unfold it. The new technology, however, eliminates the need to do so by enabling parchment to be unrolled or unfolded 'virtually' and the contents displayed on a computer sc

Following this, there were numerous contacts from interested parties, mostly journalists. Various printed and online articles appeared shortly afterwards.

To date, March 2013, the most successful scan has been of a small rolled piece of parchment from the Norfolk Records Office. This was tightly wound and could not have been opened easily without causing damage. The scroll was successfully scanned and the iron in the ink was detected. The volumetric data was then successfully virtually unrolled at Cardiff University to produce text that could easily be read by a palaeographer. It appeared to be an old property related legal document. Following rehydration, the scroll was physically unrolled by a conservator, confirming the written test. This success has resulted in confidence in the project and we are now looking to get a larger scroll which is truly beyond conventional means of unrolling.



The new X-ray microtomography scanner was designed to employ equiangular time-delay integration (TDI) readout as a means of obtaining the most accurate scans possible using a laboratory X-ray source. This has proved to be much more difficult than anticipated because of the need to precisely control the orbital motion of the specimen about the source, which must be in exact synchronisation with the camera readout. Reconsideration of the fibre-optic faceplate shape has shown that no perfect surface can be defined that will allow for theoretically blur-free equiangular TDI images to be captured with a planar detector. However, an optimal shape has been calculated, where the blurring associated with conversion from equiangular to equidistant spacing is small in comparison with the blurring from light and X-ray scatter within the scintillator. Equiangular TDI images are free from the effects of detector array and X-ray field inhomogeneity in the horizontal direction.

In terms of determining possible damage to parchment when exposed to the X-ray dose required for high definition microtomography scanning, the following has been done:

We have used multiple techniques to assess if there is any evidence of change in parchment structure during scanning by XMT. Modern and historic parchment samples were exposed to X-rays using the high contrast XMT equipment. 



Attenuated Total Reflection Fourier Transform Infra-red Analysis (ATR-FTIR FTIR spectra for the parchment samples showed little evidence for systematic changes with radiation, principal component analysis was used to see if small changes in signal differences between samples could be revealed. This showed that the variation between the samples was greater than any changes induced by the exposure to X-rays.



Biochemical analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Results indicated that we could not detect any visual change in the separation of the peptides between control and irradiated samples.



Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) Principal components analysis of the NIR spectra of modern parchment samples showed little in terms of differences between control samples and irradiation time.



X-ray diffraction (XRD) A visual inspection of the intensity distribution could not identify any systematic changes to the collagen diffraction signal or diffuse scatter contribution between the irradiated and corresponding control samples. Principle component analysis was used to examine if there were differences between samples; however, there is no systematic detectable change as a function of irradiation.



Our overall impression from the techniques used shows that we cannot detect a systematic change to the collagen chemistry or structure that is an effect of the simulations of XMT radiation we are using to read documents.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The scanner itself has application is a wide variety of disciplines and is particularly useful where 3D information is to be recovered from objects with low X-ray contrast, such as fossils or historical artefacts. The use of linear time-delay integration in microtomography is already licensed by Queen Mary University of London to Nikon Metrology. We will seek to extend this to cover equiangular time-delay integration.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BBD53333-71DE-47C2-ADAE-16F1EEC0BBCC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.apocalypto.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Heritage Science subcommittee of the Royal Society of Chemistry</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3831B2BA-C24C-4924-B66F-E13F5B74074D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This subcommittee is in the process of arranging a parliamentary day to inform government of advances in cultural heritage science and to present the need for funding in this area.
