Vocational Education and Pedagogy in England (HIVE-PED) research seminar series will map out the research territory, report research findings, facilitate debate, and make research-based proposals relating to the field of higher vocational education and pedagogic research.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminars will define key research questions and recommendations for further research, policy development, provision and progression between further, higher and apprenticeship education sectors and related employment outcomes. A new expert group of UK and international research partners will be brought together to exchange theoretical and evidenced-based research findings, make contributions to the seminar series and collaborate in advancing research and advising on developments in policy in higher vocational education. Each major partner will contribute by leading one research seminar on a related topic over the three years, encouraging others to contribute to the debate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Partners will also collaborate in two HIVE-PED Mini Conferences, a global HIVE-PED Research MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) and in the production of more than 30 research publications, videos, research summaries, booklets and research methodology training guides over three years, including at least one special journal edition. &amp;nbsp;Partners include UK and international experts with significant experience of higher vocational education and training and post-compulsory education research.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic and societal impact from this HIVE-PED ESRC Research Seminar Series will be achieved through active engagement of partners in government, the public sector, commercial private sector, third sector and wider public. Medium and longer term impact achieved will be instrumental (developing policy, through BIS); conceptual (contributing to frameworks of understanding, through expert academic researchers); and capacity-building (developing research, provision and practice, through researchers, providers, qualifications agencies and think tanks). 

The series brings together expert UK and international partners to debate research in higher vocational education and pedagogy over three years. Seminar contributions will be facilitated from all partners. Researchers, policy makers and providers will become part of a community of practice ('HIVE'), collaborating to map out and develop further research evidence. Short term impact will include an increase in knowledge, understanding and communication between stakeholders. 

Pathways to impact were considered from the outset and will be achieved through a wide-reaching, broad-based participation policy to ensure opportunities for stakeholder engagement and dialogue are at the forefront of activities. The Impact Strategy involves users at all stages, including Design, Execution, Dissemination and Training. The strategy has four elements:-

* Programme Design: Conferences will 'top and tail' the seminar series, influencing the design of the research seminar programme, enabling a larger forum for participation with themes of general interest and a broad range of perspectives. Seminars will focus on narrower themes, attracting specific constituencies of users and beneficiaries, while MOOC sessions will intersperse seminars with global dissemination of research findings and methodologies. 

* A Steering Group: brings together users, including BIS, PwC LLUVAC, AoC, City &amp;amp;Guilds, Pearson Think Tank, UKCES, LSIS, NIACE, NAS; Linking London, Second Wave Youth Arts and employer representatives with Academic Strategic Planning Partners, enabling members to shape seminar content, ensure relevance, currency and fit with policy issues. The Steering Group will have a key role as a critical friend, reviewing seminar content from a user perspective and disseminating outputs through established infrastructures, enabling a reach beyond the capacity of seminar investigators. 

* HIVE-PED Communications and Engagement methodologies: will include the publication of papers, case studies and roundtable events in the conferences and seminars; podcasting keynote speakers, two global HIVE-PED MOOC Research sessions in Higher Vocational Education and Pedagogy and the development of a dedicated website with extensive links to prior ESRC projects, websites of our collaborative partners and to the use of interactive social media. In addition, the University of Greenwich will utilise its Public Relations and Partnerships offices to provide additional capacity and expertise.

* The Impact Typology: focuses on academic and user impacts to enhance understanding of vocational education and pedagogy, reviewing innovative methodologies for tracking progression, best practice emerging from international comparative models and drawing together established and early career researchers to share research outputs and define a forward plan which will shape future research agendas. Economic and Societal impacts will be considerable, given the strength of the extensive user base. Specifically it will contribute to evidenced based policy-making by enhancing the knowledge base of user organisations, influencing the future shape of vocational provision and informing professional practice within the HE and FE sector.

The conference had a significant impact on those who participated, evidenced by very good feedback data and subsequent publications, still in preparation, which will be gathered together in the final reporting period for the ESRC Seminar Series. 

A notable impact is that the South African government contacts involved with the four universities involved were highly supportive of the focus on higher vocational education, since in South Africa policy developments involving the Year of the Artisan (2013) was taking place at the time that the PI proposed that a higher vocational focus would be appropriate to what had originally been envisaged, notionally, by African colleagues as an 'elearning in higher education' conference. The PI persuaded academics in the universities involved to consider making the focus 'higher vocational' instead, which at first puzzled the co-organisers (they asked 'what do you mean by that, does that include work in universities or not?), but which gradually took shape and increasingly made sense in an African context. Further information on this will be added in the final reporting period when the publications and data are complete.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>#ETinEd 2015 Emerging Technologies Conference Twitter stream and digital artefacts</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/hashtag/etinedconf?src=hash</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Huddersfield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Education and Professional Development</gtr:department><gtr:description>University of Huddersfield Education</gtr:description><gtr:id>D9D4B943-86A3-4575-9E68-3917D427B56F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professors Kevin Orr and James Avis have contributed presentations to the seminar series events and will be participating in publications and other outputs to emerge from the series in due course.

HIVE-PED Research Seminar Eight: Higher Vocational Education: Parity and Success
Date: 13 May 2016
Venue: Institute of Education, University College London (UCL)

PURPOSE
This seminar at the Institute of Education, University of London aimed to provide an expert seminar update on research findings in higher vocational education for the HIVE-PED series, enabling participants to engage with trends emerging in current research, notably from the work of the Keynote Speakers, organisers and the audience. There was a good attendance of c.65 delegates from higher, further and adult education provider representatives, research and policy-making organisations, independent researchers, third sector voluntary, charitable and community partners. 

OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
Excellent engagement throughout the day indicated yet again a continuing strong interest in the field of higher vocational education, particularly with regards to emerging higher vocational education developments in relation to teaching and learning, research theory and the economy. The immediate outcome of the day was an improved knowledge and understanding of the theoretical, pedagogical and economic context of the field, provided in the many contributions from expert researchers amongst the speakers, discussion panel and audience. This had ramifications for impact on institutions indirectly and more directly on delegates' professional practice and policy-making responses in institutions. The longer-term outputs, outcomes and impacts of this event and others in the series include specialist publications, indirect and direct influence on national and local higher vocational and pedagogic understandings of policy and impact in terms of the ongoing dissemination and knowledge-buildlng processes generated by the series. 

SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS
Following a welcome by Professor Karen Evans (UCL Institute of Education), Professor Jill Jameson (ESRC HIVE-PED Seminar Series Lead) provided an overview of the HIVE-PED Seminar Series. This was followed by an outline of the seminar by Dr Natasha Kersh (UCL Institute of Education). The proceedings of the day are outlined below.

The free conference focused on important research evidence recently published by BIS about the progression of apprentices nationally and on new research evidence published by Linking London about the progression of apprentices and college learners in London. The key findings of the BIS funded national research on apprentices was presented along with keynotes about policy from BIS and NAS and about the research context from Professor Alison Fuller from the Institute of Education, University of London.

The conference then focused on London and the key findings of the Linking London research into the progression of both London apprentices and London FE students were presented. Keynotes relating to the London context from London Councils Young People's Education and Skills Unit, the FE context from the Association of Colleges and about key messages for universities and colleges from Professor Jill Jameson from the University of Greenwich.

There were opportunities for discussion, reflection, questions and networking.

PURPOSE
This final conference intended to provide an overview of the HIVE-PED series, enabling participants to engage with the findings that had emerged during the series. There was good attendance of c.75 delegates from higher, further and adult education provider representatives, research and policy-making organisations, independent researchers, third sector voluntary, charitable and community partners. 

OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
Lively engagement throughout the day indicated a strong interest in the developing field of higher vocational education, particularly with regards to the relationship of vocational progression re. employment, the UK economy and emerging policy developments. The immediate outcome of the day was an improved knowledge and understanding of the field, provided in the many contributions from expert researchers. This had ramifications for impact on professional practice and policy in institutions. The longer-term outputs, outcomes and impacts include specialist publications, indirect influence on national and local higher vocational and pedagogic understandings of policy and impact in terms of the ongoing dissemination and knowledge-buildlng processes generated by the series. 

SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS
Following a welcome and overview of the series by Professor Jill Jameson, Chair, Centre for Leadership and Enterprise, University of Greenwich, Chris Philpott, Deputy Pro Vice Chancellor of the university, welcomed delegates to the day conference and introduced the first keynote speaker, Professor Ewart Keep, Director of the Centre for Skills, Knowledge and Organisational Performance (SKOPE), University of Oxford. 

Professor Keep's speech on 'Some thoughts on the centrality of employers to achieving more and better higher level vocational education' was followed by a question and discussion session. Themes from this were picked up in the Discussion panel: 'Higher Vocational Education: the state we're in', chaired by Professor Christopher Winch, Professor of Educational Philosophy and Policy, King's College, London. Professor Jameson introduced the Panel members: Professor Alan Tuckett, OBE, Chair of Education, University of Wolverhampton; Sue Betts, Director of Linking London, Birkbeck, University of London; Charlynne Pullen, Senior Research Fellow (Skills), IPPR, who each delivered a presentation on the main themes of the higher vocational education and pedagogy series and its relationship with their own work and organisational context. 

After lunch and networking discussions, Professor Jameson introduced Dr Liz Atkins, Reader in Education, Department of Education and Lifelong Learning, Northumbria University, Visiting Research Fellow, University of Huddersfield, who delivered a Keynote Speech on 'Higher Vocational Education in an age of uncertainty,' 

This challenging subject was debated further in the Discussion panel on 'Professional and vocational dilemmas in Higher Vocational Education', chaired by Professor Kevin Orr, Professor of Work and Learning, University of Huddersfield. Hugh Joslin, Senior Research Associate, ESRC HIVE-PED Project, University of Greenwich introduced Panel Members: Debi Hayes, Provost and Chief Academic officer, GSM London; Dr Bob Gilworth and David Winter, HEFCE Learning Gain Pilot, the Careers Group, University of London; Sharon Smith, Senior Research Associate, ESRC HIVE-PED Project, University of Greenwich, who each provided an overview of their own work and organisational developments in relation to the current state of higher vocational development. A lively discussion ensued. .

To round off the day, Professor Jameson summed up the key events and activities delivered in the seminar series and then introduced Professor Gareth Parry, Director of the Centre for the Study of Higher Education, University of Sheffield and Programme Leader at the ESRC/HEFCE Centre for Global Higher Education. Gareth delivered a Keynote Speech, providing a 'Final Reflection: higher vocational education: a local-global space?' Gareth's talk mirrored the start of the series, as he had been invited to deliver the opening address at the first seminar, encouraging participants to reflect on developments in higher vocational education in the intervening time. 

A concluding thanks and acknowledgements from Professor Jill Jameson, Principal Investigator, provided an official end to the seminar series, with thanks to the ESRC, all co-investigators and partner institutions, participants and supporters. It was noted that further outputs would emerge in the form of books, journal articles, teaching and learning materials including a MOOC. The seminar rounded off an encouragement from the PI and expert team to engage in follow-up dissemination, output completion and the delivery of ESRC HIVE-PED Seminars Series impact during the next several years.

HIGHER VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND PEDAGOGY (HIVE-PED) POLICY COLLOQUIUM

Date: Wednesday 29th June 2016 King's College London 10.30 - 16.00
King's College London, Edmund J Saffra Lecture Theatre, Strand Campus, Strand, London, WC2R 2LS

PURPOSE
This policy colloquium at King's College London aimed to provide an expert policy update on higher vocational education for the HIVE-PED series, enabling participants to engage with the findings that were emerging in current research, notably from the work of the Keynote Speakers, Professor Alison Wolf, Professor Stephen Tee and Professor James Avis. There was very good attendance of c.80 delegates from higher, further and adult education provider representatives, research and policy-making organisations, independent researchers, third sector voluntary, charitable and community partners. 

OUTCOMES AND IMPACTS
Lively engagement throughout the day indicated a continuing strong interest in the field of higher vocational education, particularly with regards to emerging tertiary education policy developments in relation to the UK nations, Europe and the economy. The immediate outcome of the day was an improved knowledge and understanding of the policy context of the field, provided in the many contributions from expert researchers amongst the speakers, discussion panel and audience. This had ramifications for impact on government policy indirectly and more directly on professional practice and policy in institutions. The longer-term outputs, outcomes and impacts include specialist publications, indirect and direct influence on national and local higher vocational and pedagogic understandings of policy and impact in terms of the ongoing dissemination and knowledge-buildlng processes generated by the series. 

SUMMARY OF PROCEEDINGS
Following a welcome and overview of the series by Professor Jill Jameson, Chair, Centre for Leadership and Enterprise, University of Greenwich, Dr Camille Kandiko Howson, Academic Head of Student Engagement, King's College London, welcomed delegates to the day conference. The proceedings of the day are outlined below.

In addition, presentations about the series and the research linked with it were made in 2013-16 to several British Educational Research Annual Conferences, to the Society for Research into Higher Education Annual Conference, to the JVET conference in Oxford, to Linking London and London Councils partner events, to the UALL Annual Conference, to further education participants at the AoC Higher Education conference, to school teachers, researchers and research students at the ETinEd conference at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, and to local managers planning degree Apprenticeships at the University of Greenwich. The resulting knowledge exchange and debate has stimulated the thinking of participants and partners in multiple ways, informing policy makers, academics, researchers and agencies from across the field of higher vocational education and pedagogy in national and international contexts. 

The events run in the series have been used to consider and debate the role of higher vocational education and pedagogy and their effectiveness in relation to local, national and global economic, employment and skills performance. In addition, a number of events have made specific links between higher vocational education policy, progression and parity, in terms of equality, social justice and the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom and other participant nations. 

A focus on improving the effectiveness of the system of tertiary/higher vocational education provision for students has emerged as regards improving public services and policy-making. There has been a general recognition that, despite much evidence of local good practice, a recurring theme has been the relative complexity and impenetrability of higher vocational progression routes from school-college-higher education to employment in the UK, notably in England. Researchers have recognised the strong need to improve the viability of the system to achieve better outcomes for employment, social justice and equality amongst students, with the ultimate aim of enhancing quality of life and health and reducing poverty and unemployment throughout the UK's communities.

Findings from the BIS-funded HIVE-PED progression research linked to the project seminars were also specifically used in 2014-15 to provide evidence for BIS government policy in the field of higher vocational education and skills relating to progression to higher education and employment, as well as to regional and local policy makers and providers, and did so again during 2016. The ninth seminar in the series, a Higher Vocational Policy Consortium at King's College, London, was held in June, 2016, with Keynote Speaker Professor Alison Wolf, Baroness Wolf of Dulwich, a world expert in tertiary education, who reported findings from her seminal research on tertiary education. This colloquium debated potential impacts on policy of research into higher vocational education and pedagogy and considered also emerging work from various experts on HEFCE-funded Learning Gain projects, in preparation for likely introduction of the Teaching Excellence Framework. 

A regional spin-out from the series, closely linked to presentations from the University of Greenwich team and partners, reported at several events, was a series of progression research reports funded by Linking London. The contributory findings of this series of successive funded research projects, run in parallel with the seminar series, widened and deepened the impact and involvement of expert researchers from numerous institutions, including the Institute of Education, University of London, the Universities of Oxford, Birmingham, Huddersfield, King's College, Sheffield, Wolverhampton, the Open University and Northumbria. The contributions of a range of specialist vocational sector and research agencies such as the Association of Colleges, City and Guilds, the IPPR, the Education and Training Foundation, UVAC, the Learning and Work Institute and the Apprenticeships Policy Unit were strongly welcomed. 

An international spin-out impact from the series has been that it also influenced the organisation and delivery of a new conference series on Emerging Technologies and Authentic Learning in Higher Vocational Education (ETinED: http://etined.com/ ) in Africa. The Principal Investigator, who is also the Convenor of the British Educational Research Association Special Interest Group on Educational Technology, invited colleagues in the Universities of Cape Town, the Western Cape, Cape Peninsula University of Technology and the University of Stellenbosch, to set up a conference with her in higher vocational education, linked to two special editions of the British Journal of Educational Technology (BJET) in 2016: http://goo.gl/gSxerJ co-edited with academic colleagues in South Africa. 

The seminar series award therefore influenced a new set of collaborations and research partnerships linked to higher vocational education and pedagogy with specific reference to educational technology within a Sub-Saharan African context, as the 'higher vocational' focus (and all of the resulting research, presentations, discussions and collaborations that resulted) would not have occurred without the award. It is likely that the ETinEd conference will be called together again for a second event: ETinEd2, in 2018-19, again with a higher vocational education focus. This is crucial within an African digital education context, in view of the higher level skills, inequalities, poverty, drought and youth unemployment crises currently affecting developing Sub-Saharan African nations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BB002FD0-A6DB-490F-85CC-73CC603A2300</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Eleven specialist HIVE-PED research events were held and a network of researchers developed during this ESRC research seminars project. Important new research questions opened up as part of this process regarding the viability, equity and effectiveness of higher vocational education in England and elsewhere. 

The events included nine research seminars, one of which was a policy colloquium held at King's College, London, plus an initial and closing conference held at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and University of Greenwich respectively. An additional spin-out conference was organised - the Emerging Technologies and Authentic Learning in HIVE (ETinEd) conference in South Africa. In total, twelve events were held, involving a wide range of international, UK and EU researchers, institutions, agencies and participants. 

Key findings on research into higher vocational education and pedagogy were reported by expert researchers from England and all the UK nations, from Australia, the USA, the EU, Canada and Africa. These were debated in detail in discussions involving representatives from numerous universities, colleges, schools, policy makers, private training providers and agencies, including particular reference to different higher vocational skills and qualifications pathways, countries and geographical areas. A number of research-based proposals relating to the field of higher vocational education and pedagogic research in England were proposed in the various events of the series, and these are being collected together in numerous publications that will emerge during the next few years. 

An example of the events held was the in-depth research event reporting large scale data on progression in London in Seminar Seven in partnership with Linking London, Birkbeck College and London Councils, involving 32 different providers and agencies based in London, which attracted a range of regional and national delegates. 

A further example was in Seminar Six organised in collaboration with leading professorial experts in adult education at the University of Wolverhampton. This event discussed UK-wide and EU research findings on the decline in adult learning opportunities, a theme which was picked up again in Seminar Nine at King's College, London, where professorial experts in policy presented research findings to selected participants in a Higher Vocational Education Policy Colloquium. 

By contrast, a different kind of series of findings and discussions on higher vocational education in relation to emerging technologies and transforming pedagogy for developing countries occurred in the ETinEd Conference in Cape Town in Aug/Sept 2015, when researchers from numerous universities, postgraduate students, school and college teachers and policy makers from across a range of African countries came together to discuss the need for digital pedagogy in higher vocational developments in Sub Saharan Africa.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings presented in the project will inform policy makers, researchers, academics, practitioners and agencies in the field of higher vocational education and related areas. It is likely that government policy has been and may continue to be influenced as a result of the new information on higher vocational education and apprenticeships provision and pedagogy provided by the project and the underpinning strands of research connected with it. Project members were in discussions with two Deputy Directors at BIS and with colleagues at the Association of Colleges, London Councils, Linking London, UALL, SRHE and elsewhere about this. It is also likely that provider approaches were positively influenced as a result of the reporting at the ESRC research seminar series events of the findings of in-depth analysis carried out on higher vocational longitudinal progression data tracking all colleges and apprenticeships provision in England. As an example of the influence on government policy, see: https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/121889/BIS-13-664-progression-of-apprentices-to-higher-education.pdf.

As an example of the influence on leaders, managers, practitioners, agencies and policy makers, the ESRC HIVE-PED Greenwich team was invited to present on the subject of 'Understanding College Students' Progression to HE' in relation to higher vocational education at the Association of Colleges Annual Conference and Exhibition on 3rd March, 2016: https://goo.gl/7i4WlP

The ESRC award for the seminar series has therefore enabled the HIVE-PED research team and its partners to disseminate research findings, debate and critique findings, collaborate on the formation of new ideas, and provide advice to managers and practitioners in charge of shaping provision in colleges, private provider institutions and universities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0615D31A-FB55-4B15-9298-DFDEAA87E8B4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gre.ac.uk/eduhea/research/groups/cle/research/hiveped/seminars</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Higher Vocational Education and Pedagogy (HIVE-PED) BIS-Funded Progression Research Data and Analysis</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F6ECB5D8-DF8F-430B-B2C7-2BE6A7C72924</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are anticipating that existing impacts in terms of new influences on BIS government policy as a result of the longitudinal research reported and discussed in the ESRC seminar series will have long term effects in the provision and tracking of higher vocational education students and related economic and public service delivery efficiency impacts across England in particular.

The session was explicitly linked to the ESRC HIVE-PED Research Seminars project in relation to findings from two government-funded BIS (Dept for Business, Innovation and Skills) reports on research underpinning the seminars project. 

The authors reported that &amp;quot;Understanding progression behaviours and trends are critical if we are to grow the college HE sector. The workshop was a summary of two BIS-commissioned reports into the progression to higher education of students from FE Colleges and Sixth Form Colleges in England. This was longitudinal research and the presentation related to cohorts of students between the academic years 2007-08 and 2011-12 entering higher education (HE) between the years 2008-09 and 2012-13. The research provides a unique and comprehensive picture of the very different factors underlying the progression behaviour of students progressing to higher education from colleges rather than from school sixth forms. It illustrates the added value that FE and Sixth Form Colleges contribute by looking at the GCSE results students leave school with before going to college, examining the achievement rates of those awarded degrees.&amp;quot;

Delegates attending the AoC annual college were practitioners and managers from the FE and Sixth Form College and Higher Education sectors, and the impact on evolving national internal institutional policy and practice resulted from improved educational knowledge about progression behaviours amongst students.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or
