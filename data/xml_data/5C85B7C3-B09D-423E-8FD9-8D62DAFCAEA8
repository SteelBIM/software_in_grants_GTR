But what do organisms do that do not have sex? How do they face environmental challenges, such as high temperatures?

We will address these questions by focusing on a special protein called heat shock protein Hsp90. As its name implies, it is important during heat stress. Hence, every organism from bacteria to humans requires it for life. Hsp90 stabilizes other proteins that are involved in such crucial processes as cell division, development and stress response. Two specific examples of how Hsp90 affects life include its chaperoning of proteins involved in human cancers and the emergence of drug resistance in fungi. Indeed, Hsp90 interacts with and stabilizes up to 10% of all other proteins in the cell. This organization, which includes Hsp90 and its interactors, is called the Hsp90 chaperone network. We hypothesize that the network and its interactors are changing over evolutionary time depending on the environmental conditions. This helps organisms, such as asexual fungi, adapt to new environments. Since Hsp90 occupies a central position in regulating gene function, addressing these questions will inform our understanding about some important basic biological mechanisms.

Fungi are excellent model organisms to test this hypothesis. We will employ three different fungi that diverged about half a billion years ago and live in very different environments. One occupies fruits. Another lives in pigeon guano and trees but can cause severe infections of the human brain in AIDS patients. The third fungus lives naturally in the mouth and guts of humans but can cause life-threatening infections under special circumstances. Only the first fungus is capable of exchanging genetic material, the other two are not. Due to their diverse life styles and modes of exchanging genes, these three fungi have been developed as model systems over the past decades. In fact, the experimental tools required to map the Hsp90 chaperone network to date only exist in these fungi.

We will investigate how the Hsp90 chaperone network aids organisms in the exploration of novel environments without the benefits of sex by pursuing three objectives. First, we will map the Hsp90 chaperone networks in the three fungi when grown in six different environmental conditions. Second, we will collaborate with mathematicians to analyze which kinds of proteins are particularly common in our networks and test conditions. Third, we will study how specific Hsp90 interactors affect fungal stress responses.

Our research program will deliver three new chaperone network maps. By comparing them with each other, we will understand how networks change over time and in dependence of different environmental conditions. We will, furthermore identify novel Hsp90 interactors and understand how specific interactors affect stress adaptation in different fungi.

The research proposed here will benefit a diverse clientele. In the short-term, on a scholarly level, we will be able to assess the impact of the Hsp90 chaperone network on an organism's ability to colonize new spaces. We will identify novel interactors that can be further investigated by scientists interested in the diverse aspects of Hsp90 biology, including geneticists, cancer biologists, and fungi researchers. We will provide theoretical biologists with network data that they can use to generate new hypothesis, which in turn can then be tested by biologists. The long-term beneficiaries of our research will be patients in the UK and world-wide who suffer from cancer and fungal infections, both of which are regulated by Hsp90. Our novel Hsp90 interactors could potentially lead to the development of new drugs to help conquer cancer and fight fungal infections.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Some species exist without the benefits of sexual recombination. Thus, how do predominantly clonal organisms colonize new niches and cope with the stress associated with adaptation?
We will focus on Hsp90, which occupies a central position in the cell's protein homeostasis and is critical for diverse aspects of life. For example in humans it stabilizes the oncoprotein p53, while it potentiates emergence of drug resistance in fungi through its client protein calcineurin. Hsp90 regulates gene function on two organizational levels. It interacts with up to 10% of the cell's proteome and it modulates the translation of genotype to phenotype by buffering cryptic genetic variation in its interactors, the mechanics of which remain elusive.
We propose that Hsp90 affects environmental adaptation and stress resistance in predominantly clonal organisms. Fungi are excellent models to test this. To date, genomic tools exist in three species that diverged half a billion years ago, adapted to different niches, and have varied mating systems. We will use Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans to: (1) Map their Hsp90 chaperone networks, (2) Compare networks for evolutionary and ecological signatures, (3) Associate genetic variation in interactors with stress response.
We will conduct chemical-genomic screens on bar-coded mutant libraries grown in six environmental conditions. The resulting networks will be analyzed for functional enrichment, bulk properties and interactor strength. These will be correlated to fungal life history. From the networks we will select conserved and divergent kinase interactors, screen those for selection signatures and test the effect of different alleles on stress response.
Our research is expected to deliver new Hsp90 network maps complementing existing data. Our multi-species chaperone network landscape enables comparative analyses and identifies novel Hsp90 interactors, which could be exploited as drug targets.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Different aspects of our research into cross-species Hsp90 genetic interaction networks will affect basic bioscience, human health as well as the economy. Here we specify, whom our research program will affect.

Academia - Our research program focuses on fundamental scientific questions. Consequently, the most immediate impact will be of academic nature. Our research is inherently cross-disciplinary, touching on genomics, microbiology, and molecular biology for example. Hence, our research program will be influencing academic knowledge in other areas beyond our immediate colleagues in fungal genetics. It will, furthermore, add to the UK academic portfolio of systems biology.

Biomedical research community - Two aspects of our research will impact biomedical research. First, antifungal drug resistance is a considerable problem. Drug resistances emerge rapidly and are irreversible rendering many drugs inefficient, sometimes within a very short time. Identifying suitable drug targets is tremendously challenging due to the shared ancestry of fungi and animals. Hsp90, however, potentiates drug resistance. While Hsp90 is highly conserved across the tree of life, not all of its interactors are conserved. Thus, by identifying molecules that regulate fungal Hsp90 but not human Hsp90, our research will affect biomedical research by providing novel drug targets that could be used as starting points by chemical pharmacologists. Second, Hsp90 stabilizes cancer proteins. Yet, enquiries into Hsp90 interactions in humans are technically challenging. Here we provide a novel set of down-stream interactors, some of which will be conserved and could thus be used as templates for the study of Hsp90 clients in humans. This is particularly interesting because we know the function of many yeast proteins but not always that of their human homologs. Consequently, investigations into human Hsp90 clients could be guided by our set of interactors, helping to inform human geneticist about which experimental venue to follow when dissecting Hsp90's role in cancer.

Human health - Every year ~700 people die in the UK of systemic candidiasis, an infection of the blood stream and organs caused by Candida albicans. For comparison, according to the Office for National Statistics, 364 people died of MRSA in England and Wales in 2011. While MRSA has garnered substantial publicity in the past, fungi are the hidden killers (Brown et al., 2012). We are poised to lessen this burden on human health. Previous research showed that inhibiting Hsp90 renders fungi susceptible to drugs. Our research will yield novel Hsp90 regulators that can be exploited for more efficacious therapeutic strategies to combat fungal infections.

Economy - Every year the UK spends &amp;pound;16.2 million to treat fungal infections, such as candidiasis, and to support life-long antifungal therapy necessary in HIV patients with C. neoformans. Our goal is to positively affect this situation by delivering new drug targets that will lessen the economic burden of fungal infections.

PDRA - An important aspect of being a principal investigator at an academic institution like the University of Bath is being a mentor and teacher to the next generation of scientists. The principal investigator here takes mentoring and teaching serious and aspires to being a role model for young scientists, particularly female scientists. This research program is designed such that parts of it can be developed independently by a PDRA with the option of evolving it into a future research program, which can be continued in the PDRA's own lab. It furthermore equips the PDRA with novel cross-disciplinary skills, involving genomics and bioinformatics.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>427936</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Animation artist Tamara Webster (http://creativepool.com/MaraWebster) created a short video based on my Bath Ignite talk.

Intensive optimization was required because the DNA samples derived from these experiments will be submitted for next gen sequencing, at a substantial cost. To ensure maximum success, we carefully optimized the screening conditions. As these screens using bar-coded mutant libraries are still rather uncommon for the organisms we are working on (non-model, human pathogenic yeast species), optimization was a rather pain-stacking process but is complete now and samples ready for the next stage of the process.

As a research resource, we created a collection of &amp;gt;200 viable mutants of an important Hsp90 client that will be important in our quest for understanding Hsp90's buffering capacity. This mutant collection, which will be publically available once the grant expires, could be of use to other researchers who are interested in how mutation load affects protein function or general aspects of natural variation in DNA sequence. 

This aspect of our research has also yielded a new research question. It is quite astounding how degenerate a protein can be for Hsp90 to correctly treat it and ensure cell viability. This raises the question what the maximum mutation load (and quality of mutations) can be at which point the Hsp90 system breaks down and with it cell survival.

As part of this grant, we developed an online software tool that allows for the quick and easy analysis of growth data from arrayed strain/mutant collections. This resource is publically available and facilitates quick comparisons between growth curves from different conditions for the same set of strains/mutants (GrowthGrids; https://hobrien.shinyapps.io/GrowthGrid/). We aim to continue to develop free software tools as part of our research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In concordance with the Pathways to Impact statement, I have disseminated research outcomes from this grant through oral and poster presentations at the ASM Candida and candidiasis meeting and the meeting of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology (ISHAM).
