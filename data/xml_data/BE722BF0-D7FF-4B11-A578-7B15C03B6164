We can't see or directly observe molecules, atoms, or electromagnetic fields -- never mind quarks or the Higgs boson! But advanced physics, with its well-confirmed theories and impressive experimental instruments, is typically portrayed (in the mass media for example) as providing knowledge of the true nature of fundamental reality. The aim of this project is to evaluate the credentials of this scientific realist attitude in the context of quantum physics. 

Scientific realism, although widely shared, commonsensical, and supported by the success of science, has been viewed by many as a justified attitude towards fundamental science. Equally many have stepped up in defence of realism, and the debate between scientific realists and anti-realists has raged in the philosophy of science since the late 70s. Like much of philosophy, the debate has been largely conducted in very general and abstract terms, quite independently of specific scientific detail. Philosophers have advanced increasingly sophisticated arguments both for and against scientific realism on the basis of general considerations (involving, for example, radical theory-shifts in the history of science, on the one hand, and the impressive instrumental, explanatory, and predictive success of science, on the other). Recently philosophers have started to acknowledge the limitations of such general arguments and the importance of case-specific scientific details. But such case-specific study of scientific realism has yet to be done in connection with one of our most advanced sciences: quantum physics. This project fills this gap by systematically reconsidering the arguments for and against scientific realism in the light of quantum physics, its history and its current state of play. 

To do this we bring together researchers from general philosophy of science and philosophy of physics for fruitful interaction. We examine, first of all, the various ways in which the actual details of quantum physics matter to the realism debate. More specifically, we conduct a comparative evaluation of existing arguments both for and against scientific realism in light of specific features of quantum physics, clearly pinning down the prospects and problems of these arguments in this particular context. We also consider the possibility of advancing novel arguments for and against realism in the context of quantum physics. Secondly, we evaluate the extent and status of our knowledge of the quantum world in light of the realism debate by examining, in relation to realist positions that are defensible in this context, what we can claim to know about the various features of reality described by quantum physics. (e.g. Can we know the nature of quantum particles and fields? Whether or not quantum wave function represents reality? Whether or not the world is indeterministic?) 

The project's wider significance derives from the cultural importance of the scientific knowledge claims at stake. To this end we aim to enhance the general public's appreciation of the philosophical issues challenging a face-value reading of fundamental physics, and we organise a series of workshops that bring the philosophical issues to the consciousness of A-level physics teachers and science journalists.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>According to a general conception, one of the aims of science is to build knowledge about the natural world. But what are the limits of scientific knowledge? For example: how much do we know about the world through fundamental physics? Our aim is to answer such questions in relation to quantum physics. While our research focuses on state-of-the-art arguments and positions in the so-called 'scientific realism debate' in the philosophy of science, our research questions have broader implications for our science-informed world view. In order to bring out these implications we will bid to attend the British Science Festival and to organise a series of public facing workshops, bringing together academic professionals, teachers, and science journalists. These will enable our research to engage with a number of discussions of public interest and have an impact on the public conception of scientific knowledge of the quantum world. 

Our research has implications and impact in at least three ways:

(1) Our work on scientific realism has implications for our attitudes towards scientific knowledge claims. Physicists and science journalists often communicate about latest discoveries in a way that engenders naive or simplistic realism about quantum physics. 

(2) Our project has impact on the way that quantum physics should be taught at the introductory level. While A-level teaching of quantum mechanics typically makes some contact with philosophical issues connected to realism, many teachers would benefit from a more developed and explicit understanding of the realism debate itself.

(3) Our work has implications on the practice of science journalism. While science journalists have some idea of the interpretational subtleties and complexities in quantum physics, few fully appreciate the force of genuine philosophical worries about 'face value reading' of quantum physics. Science journalists would benefit from a more developed and regimented understanding of the philosophical issues at stake. 


Our workshops will provide opportunities for the relevant groups of non-academic professionals to engage with the themes and results of our research, exchange ideas with academics from different backgrounds, and establish new network connections that will endure into the future. This will help to secure a longer-term legacy of impact for the project by informing future working practices of key interest groups who are able to further disseminate findings in the key areas of research.

An effective means to engage these beneficiaries with our research will be a series of workshops throughout the project. This will enable us jointly to explore the above implications. Further beneficiaries of the research include interested members of the general public who can be reached via podcasts of these workshops on the project website. 

Leeds Faculty of Arts has a strong impact infrastructure; the past record includes over 50 impact cases and it has recently invested &amp;pound;850K in a new Centre for Impact and Innovation (Arts Engaged) that will specifically aid staff in activity such as the kind of external facing workshops we plan to organise. We have good links with the University's press office and the Faculty has extensive experience to support us in organising such workshops; our external partners and further institutional contacts in Leeds for organising the events are named in &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot;. The timescale for realising the benefits here is medium-term.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224065</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project workshop  'Scientific Realism about the Quantum State', 9 September 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F0A1335-8B1E-4CB1-9871-48DF742BC719</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 25 academics and postgraduates attended a project workshop on the topic of the nature of quantum state.
