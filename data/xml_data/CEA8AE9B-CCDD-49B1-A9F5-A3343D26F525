We fully expect more impacts will become manifest at later stages beyond this point in the research process. A summary of impact related activities that have flowed from this grant funding follows.

Our findings on ethnic inequalities in childhood growth and risk of overweight and obesity have been shared via invited contributions with research users including:
- participation in an invitation only summit at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health to produce a report to inform the development of the UK Government's childhood obesity strategy, Tackling England's childhood obesity crisis
- presentations to and discussions with non-academic users, for example Public Health England (Inequalities in obesity in children and young people (November 2014)); the Big Lottery Fund initiative A Better Start (March 2016)
- participation in the All Party Parliamentary Group for A Fit and Healthy Childhood meetings (2014 ongoing) leading to reports and recommendations for 'A fit and healthy childhood' and 'The early years'

Two aspects of our work from this project: on ethnic identity and children's socio-emotional development and mental health; and our findings on the damaging effects of family experiences of racist discrimination in relation to children's development have lead to a series of discussions with the Race Equality Foundation. These links have flourished into a full collaboration and we were commissioned to lead the evaluation of the Department for Health commissioned Strengthening Families Strengthening Communities programme which is delivered by the Race Equality Foundation.

The Child of our Time blog was established at the end of 2014 to showcase the research undertaken and share findings from the ethnicity project. The blog is co-edited by PI Yvonne Kelly and external consultant Chris Garrington. It carries a mix of short accessibly written articles (http://childofourtimeblog.org.uk/2015/08/can-racism-towards-a-mum-hurt-her-children/), podcast interviews (http://childofourtimeblog.org.uk/2015/10/reporting-childrens-challenging-behaviour/), and audio slideshows (http://childofourtimeblog.org.uk/2015/03/how-well-are-the-kids-talking-ethnic-differences-in-childrens-verbal-abilities/) about the research outputs from the project. In spring 2015, as many of the outputs from the project had been shared, it was decided that a good way to maintain interest in the project blog and its existing content, would be to extend its remit to incorporate other child health focused research. An associated Twitter account was also established at this point to help promote the blog as widely as possible. The blog also has its own podcast series (audio interviews with researchers about their research) which as well as being accessible on the blog, can be subscribed to on iTunes (https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/child-of-our-time/id1002386734?mt=2). This has nine episodes. Twitter is used to continue to draw attention to our ethnicity project related content on a regular basis especially when it ties in with something topical being discussed such as child obesity, mental health, and educational attainments.
The blog is updated once or twice a month. To date, Word Press Stats show 120,000 visits from 26,000 unique visitors over the last two years and a total of unique page views at 131,000. The blog has nearly 1000 followers on Twitter and this is growing week by week. Recent Twitter followers include WHO Urban Health, an MEP, an employee of the Government Statistical Service, the director of Barnardo's Scotland, a Public Health Director, an education journalist, a school nurse, a Social Policy Group, the charity Children 1st as well as other academics interested in this area.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5D6C840B-EAE5-40F4-B666-405AAC21F789</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our work has made significant contributions to scientific research, and continues to be widely disseminated with 11 journal articles, 35 conference presentations/invited talks, a blog (http://childofourtimeblog.org.uk/) with over 16000 unique users, 78000 page views and over 800 twitter followers (@childofourtime), and to the building of noteworthy collaborations (Manchester, UK; Melbourne, Australia) and a partnership with the Race Equality Foundation, UK.

Early life experiences have an impact on health and wellbeing throughout the lifecourse. In the context of ethnic/racial inequalities in healthy development, our broad aim was to identify factors that could potentially be intervened on to improve children's life chances. Specifically, we examined how mixed heritage and experiences of racism shape children's development, and the ways in which social context, helps explain observed inequalities. We looked at indicators of health and development including risk of obesity, socioemotional difficulties and cognitive skills from thousands of children growing up in the UK and US. Cross-country comparative work has the potential to identify leverage points, as despite the cultural similarities between the UK and US there are pertinent differences in migration histories, ethnic/racial relations and social systems. Selected highlights of research findings:

Are children from ethnic/racial minority groups more likely to have unhealthy weights?
- On average, 5-year-olds from Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean and Black African groups in the UK, and Mexican and Native American groups in the US had higher BMI and were at increased risk of obesity. Explanations for these observations varied - the risk of obesity for UK Bangladeshi, US Mexican and Native American groups were due to socioeconomic circumstances, whilst a combination of socioeconomic and behavioural factors explained the UK Black Caribbean and African disadvantage (Zilanawala et al 2014).
- Across childhood (age 3 through to 11) children from Indian, Pakistani, Black Caribbean and African groups were disproportionately likely to be on 'unhealthy' BMI trajectories (Kelly et al forthcoming).

Is mixed heritage linked to increased socioemotional difficulties?
- Mixed ethnicity was linked to more socioemotional difficulties among 5 year olds from some UK minority groups, but there were no differences at the same age for mixed race Americans. Observed inequalities for British Black Caribbean mixed and Pakistani mixed children compared with their white counterparts were largely explained by socioeconomic disadvantage (Nazroo et al forthcoming). 
- Across childhood, compared with their non-mixed peers Pakistani-mixed and Bangladeshi-mixed early adolescents had more socioemotional problems (Zilanawala et al forthcoming). 

Are children from minority groups more likely labelled as having problem behaviours by their teachers?
Comparing teacher and mother ratings we found that UK Black African and African American children were disproportionately labelled by their teachers as having externalising behaviours, including inattention/hyperactivity and conduct problems (Waller et al forthcoming).

What are the links between experienced racism and children's development?
Mothers' experience of racism was linked to socioemotional development in early childhood (Kelly et al 2013), and longitudinal analysis revealed that these experiences of racism in early life had detrimental impacts on socioemotional development into early adolescence (Becares et al 2015).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have stimulated further lines of academic enquiry which we (and other researchers) will pursue within collaborations, including those which have developed as a result of this research project.

We have reached non-academic audiences in a number of ways, via: policy briefings (including DH and PHE); our ongoing involvement with the all Party Parliamentary Group for a Fit and Healthy Childhood which seeks to influence government on a range of issues around children's healthy development; meetings (Manchester December 2015 and Sheffield January 2016) which have a focus on policy and practice; the Child of our Time Blog (www.childofourtimeblog.org.uk). Findings from this project feature in 10 blog outputs, including:
Can racism towards a mum hurt her children
Ethnicity, birthweight and growth in early childhood
How well are the kids talking
What are the links between ethnicity and mental health?
Understanding ethnicity in the battle against obesity
How racism can damage our children's development
Racism rise would be bad for the kids
An associated Twitter account @childofourtime shares the blog content, followers include: young people's charities and groups, campaigners and activists, health and education practitioners, professional bodies, journalists and bloggers, think tanks and policy focused groups/organisations.

This accessible resource enhances and complements the range of outputs outlined in this report and substantially increases the potential of the research to have impact now and in the
