Such venues have been accused of offering exploitative and degrading forms of entertainment which compromise the safety not just of female performers, but all women who live and work around such venues. However, there is no existing academic research documenting this. This research accordingly aims to collect such evidence, performing a grounded analysis of the impacts of such venues on surrounding businesses and residents. This will be achieved through an examination of the impacts of venues in a small town, a large town, a small city and a regional capital, chosen to represent the diversity of club styles and settings. The research will combine analysis of objections to club licensing, guided walks in the vicinity of clubs and an extensive survey of local residents.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project is grounded in social science literatures on the sexualisation of society, fear of crime and the regulation of the night-time economy. The findings will be of interest to stakeholders in licensing, town centre management and community safety, as well as audiences in sociology, criminology and geography.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project has been formulated to have significant impact in the fields of social policy, urban planning and community safety as they impact on the work of local authorities in the UK. 

Sexual Entertainment Venues, though limited in number, are extremely significant in debates about the shape and form of contemporary nightlife given their presence in British cities has aroused considerable opposition in particular quarters because of their presentation of women's bodies as objects for sexual consumption. Such opposition has posed significant challenges for a licensing system that is supposed to have no interest in personal morality and consider only questions of public safety, disorder and crime in so much as these are germane to the licensing process.

At present, there is no reputable evidence that would withstand legal scrutiny about the impact of Sexual Entertainment Venues on residents and local businesses in British cities. As such, this project would produce evidence that will be of value to local licensing authorities in determining the suitability of venues in particular locales, considering both their responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 as well their general aim of reducing crime and disorder.

This project will hence involve considerable engagement with stakeholders and user involvement in research design, data collection and dissemination. Relevant constituencies here include: (1) residents and business representatives, including some that have opposed Sex Entertainment Venues (2) the operators of such clubs and the organisations that represent their interests (e.g. the Lap Dance Association, Federation of Licensed Victuallers) (3) the local authority licensing officers and councillors who make judgments about the suitability of premises in given locales, and the organizations who represent and advise them (e.g. the Institute of Licensing, Local Government Association). In each locale, we have the support of chief licensing officers, with letters of support attached in two cases. 

Given sensitivities and potential biases, the project will not be publicised or launched locally as being a study of attitudes towards Sexual Entertainment Venues per se. However, at the end of the project we will seek to exploit the broad public interest in this topic by developing press releases and media podcasts which summarise the aims, results and theoretical implications of the research. These will also be available on the ESRC Today web interface. Given the topic stands at the interface of sociology, social policy, gender studies, critical legal scholarship, urban studies and criminology, we intend to publish the results in journals capturing this range of disciplines. Pre-publication versions of papers are also to be presented to major international conferences, with funding for these budgeted for accordingly. All of this will help stimulate an informed discussion of the impacts of lap dancing venues on local communities.

In terms of engaging with policy makers, there will be both a final stakeholder conference at the University of Kent. The final workshop event will launch the project report - 'Crime, safety and Sexual Entertainment: what are the issues?' - and present the findings and outcomes of the research with an eye to ensuring that stakeholders are aware of the policy implications of our research. The report will offer a summary of findings that is clear, accessible and offer information directly relevant to policy and practice. This will be disseminated through relevant channels, and downloadable from key websites. The audience will consist of invited groups representing community groups, venue operators and local authorities, along with Home Office representatives in the areas of community safety and crime reduction. Licensing solicitors including Philip Kolvin QC and Leo Chamboldis (Arden Chambers) have agreed to attend this workshop, alongside licensing officers from case study cities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>94271</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short video describing the key findings of the research, featuring the PI, Co-I and RA.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0BDCDE9B-DF4D-411B-B19F-28BF01AD6AB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sexualisation, nuisance and safety : sexual entertainment venues and the management of risk</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Recommendations for Sexual Entertainment Venue  Licensing in England &amp; Wales</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>33467364-5774-48CD-81A5-E8C87157FF3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Five page A4 summary sent to 302 licensing authorities in July 2013 outlining the key recommendations for licensing policy taken from project findings.

These objections mainly suggest clubs will have a negative impact on their locality, 'lowering the tone', attracting 'unsavoury' characters, and encouraging anti-sociality.



These general - and possibly unrepresentative - objections contrasted with the more representative results of our survey completed in four British towns/cities. Only around 3% of 941 respondents felt that an SEV was a source of particular nuisance, and the majority claimed that town or city centres were appropriate locations for lap dancing clubs. However, 83% of people think SEVs are unsuitable near Schools or Nurseries, and 65% near religious facilities. Only 3% think SEVs are suitable in residential areas. Around one in ten claim there are no suitable locations for SEVs. This group is most likely to regard SEVs as promoting sexism, and least likely to regard it as harmless entertainment. This group is most likely to report avoiding walking past SEVs at night, and to say there were too many SEVs in their town. Women were significantly over-represented in this group, suggesting the presence of SEVs in the night-time city has gendered effects. 



This was explored in our guided walks, which suggested women were significantly more likely to note, and comment on, the presence of SEVs in their local towns than men. Here, unease about SEVs appeared more related to questions of class, morality and disgust than fear, with SEV's contribution to antisocial behavior and criminality deemed marginal, and in some cases insignificant, compared with other venues. The extent to which lap dance clubs provoke comment and unease appears strongly related to their external appearance and the extent to which they obviously advertise the sexual nature of the entertainment occurring within. Here, concerns centred on the idea that seeing such clubs would normalise particular ideas about the consumption of women's sexuality among young people (a concern most likely to be expressed by women).



The implication is that SEVs are not regarded a significant source of nuisance by the majority, but that a minority feel such clubs are inappropriate principally because they promote sexism. Perceptions of SEVs therefore appear to be strongly shaped by gender: religion and ethnicity made no significant difference to attitudes to SEVs. Far from dismissing gendered concerns about the presence of lap dancing clubs in British cities, our research underlines that their visibility and location is something that can raise anxieties that appear most strongly felt by women.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These results are of consequence for managers and owners of clubs which are subject to Sexual Entertainment Venue (SEV) licensing in Britain, as well as the local authorities charged with administering the licensing system introduced to regulate such clubs. They are also of import for communities and groups opposed to lap dancing clubs on grounds of community safety, morality and/or gendered equality. As such, they will be cited in public, media and political debates, and may be used/exploited by legal experts in licensing applications and judicial review. This use is likely to be limited to the UK, though the data collected in this study will no doubt be cited internationally given the lack of studies of the impact of sex premises on communities. These findings are of relevance in the context of wider debates about the sexualisation of society, and will be cited in fields including sociology, women's studies and criminology. Beyond the results of the survey and guided walk activities, this project has shed new light on the role of licensing in shaping the 'moral' landscape of British cities. 



While there is little obvious potential for commercial exploitation, the results will be of value in enriching the public and political debates surrounding the putative sexualisation of our cities. For particular stakeholders concerned with the management or regulation of lap dancing clubs, these results will be of considerable importance (see below).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5566BC3B-527E-4C07-B46D-0B47B8473261</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/14F3C30C-5E83-4F6E-983C-2DF2152587C1"><gtr:id>14F3C30C-5E83-4F6E-983C-2DF2152587C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Taking back the night : gender and the contestation of adult entertainment</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eba5976960f464ce3a5c9fe709380f03"><gtr:id>eba5976960f464ce3a5c9fe709380f03</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Philip Hubbard (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/203D5B5E-890A-4D91-B117-406B89638A75"><gtr:id>203D5B5E-890A-4D91-B117-406B89638A75</gtr:id><gtr:title>Taking back the night?
