Although invited speakers were all academics, the audience invited are the general public, with a general interest in the topic. Important to this project it helped raise awareness of the scam. We believe this important given that part of SOCA's prevention strategy fro mass marketing fraud has been to raise awareness. We hope that more people knowing about the scam will help stop them becoming a victim in the first place.

Abstract: The online dating romance scam is a relatively new and under-reported international crime. It has serious financial and emotional consequences, which may have affected large numbers of people. Little is known about psychological characteristics that may put people at risk of victimization, or the effects of being targeted by scammers. This talk describes a project examining the psychological processes underlying online romance scams, possible risk factors, and psychological consequences for victims. Findings from two online studies will be reported, and implications for crime-prevention and victim protection will be discussed.

This was a seminar/workshop which is a quarterly event that focuses on prevention and support for victims of crime that Trading Standards staff deal with in the Hampshire region. Attendees included staff at the Trading Standards in the region as well as those they work with in the region. Topics covered included Scam developments; new developments in safeguarding; adult serviced developments; and the specific regions within the Hampshire area's developments. The seminar/workshop was designed to consist both of lectures and interactive sessions.



The contribution Prof Whitty made to this seminar/workshop was a 2 hour session on disseminating the results of her research, providing suggestions on how Trading Standards might deal with victims and was involved in an interactive session. The lecture Prof. Whitty gave summarised the type of person more at risk at being scammed by the romance scam, the types of strategies the criminals employ as well as the psychological impact that the crime has on victims. In addition, she provided a summary of what she had learnt about how online dating companies were currently dealing with the crime and suggestions that herself and SOCA had discussed with them on how to prevent the crime. In the interaction session a discussion took place on how Trading Standards might be involved in educating their communities about mass marketing fraud, in order to help prevent the crime as well as a discussions on improved strategies Trading Standards might employ to better deal with victims of this crime. In particular, a discussion took place on how to deal with victims in denial to help break the cycle of victimisations. Prof. Whitty provided suggestions on how to do this based on the research findings. The feedback Prof Whitty received from this session was very positive.

This was created as a Youtube video and is show at the New Media Museum in Bradford.



The interview is described as: Monica Whitty (University of Leicester) discusses her recent ESRC funded work on dating scams, aided by SOCA, various online dating agencies, and victim support groups. This work has focused on attempting to identify a typology of victims, as well as to recognize the techniques used by scammers, and the psychological impact of the scams themselves. She tells Bernie Hogan (Oxford Internet Institute) about the extraordinary sums of money fraudulently obtained through these scams, and also highlights the long lasting effects felt by many victims. Because of the intimate nature of these crimes, she discusses strategies for creating more effective forms of awareness, as well as mechanisms for automatically alerting people to the potential for an online interaction being fraudulent.

In some cases the victims themselves become involved in illegal activities (sometimes knowingly)&amp;quot;.



Professor Monica Whitty, author of the paper, The Psychology of the Online Dating Romance Scam, wrote: &amp;quot;Towards the end of the scam, some individuals are asked to take off their clothes and perform sexual acts in front of the webcam. The recordings might be used at a later date to blackmail the victims. The fraud ends only when the victim learns they have been scammed and ceases to give money.&amp;quot;

Suggestions included developing networks of victims to provide support for one another, new strategies to break news to victims that they are indeed victims, introductions to Victim Support to provide supper for these victims. The Trading Standards took on some of these suggestions and Prof. Whitty is in ongoing communication with them to discuss how the strategies are working and to consider development of future research considering other mass marketing frauds.

Study1: In Study 1 we found that most of our hypotheses were rejected. The one hypothesis that was supported was that individuals higher in romantic beliefs were more likely to be victims of the scam. People with a higher tendency towards idealisation of romantic partners were more at risk of being a victim. Victims who had lost money did report significantly more distress than those who had not. However, some non-financial victims were also severely affected, some of whom experienced more distress than the average for financial victims. Correlates of emotional distress in the non-financial victims were explored to examine the amount of variance that was found for this group on emotional distress. It was found that more lonely people, more neurotic people and those with lower scores on openness to experience were significantly more emotionally affected. Women were more affected than men. With regards to financial victims neurotic men were more likely to report distress compared with emotionally stable men.



Studies 2 and 3 revealed the following:

Typology:

? Many female victims had a history of abuse prior to the scam

? Some male victims had suffered from social phobia throughout their lives.

Persuasive techniques employed to scam the victims: 

? Scammers drew from typical persuasive techniques as previously identified by social psychologists (eg Cialdini's (2001) six basic tendencies of generating a positive response; the foot in the door technique and the elaboration likelihood model).

? Victims are given a limited time to respond to scammers' requests, preventing them from checking the legitimacy of requests and preventing hesitation.

? Media switching and frequent use of media is used to develop the relationship to higher levels of intimacy (ie grooming the victim).

? The 'ideal relationship' is established with someone who appears to care for the victim more than anyone else has in their lives. This relationship is experienced as therapeutic.

? Given the hyper-personal relationship that is developed the scammer is able to comply with secrecy.

The psychological consequences of being taken in by such a scam:

? Victims experience shame and depression and the level of shame and depression does not correlate with the amount of money scammed. The shame makes it difficult for the victim to turn to the social support they need to cope with the trauma of the event.

? There is a 'double hit' from being taken in by the scam: the loss of money as well as the loss of a relationship.

? Victims described themselves as being 'brain washed' and 'mentally raped'.

? Victims often cut off important social ties in the real world if that person questions the authenticity of the relationship.

? Victims vacillate through Kubler-Ross's (1969) stages of grieving (denial, bargaining, anger, depression, acceptance) after learning that the relationship with the scammer was not an authentic relationship.

? The denial can lead to a second wave of the scam.

? The relationship with the scammer might be best understood as an abusive relationship (sometimes sexually abusive).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results from this study can be used in non-academic contexts:

1. By health professionals who counsel these victims. Psychologists need to be aware of the trauma these victims experience and that the upset is both a financial and an emotional loss. Victims could be suicidal. Moreover, that family and friends often offer little emotional support.

2. Law enforcement agencies who deal with this crime. Officers need to be aware that victims have been traumatised. They need to ensure that they move from the early stages of denial into accepting they have been a victim very early on to ensure they do not become a victim of the second wave of the scam. Officers also need to be aware of the possible transference effects if they demonstrate empathy towards the victim.

3. Judges. Need to be made aware that these victims should be treated as intimidated witnesses and therefore be provided with the same conditions as any other intimidated witnesses (eg doing video statements etc). There is a dearth of research available on 'individual mass marketing fraud', in particular the psychology of these crimes. There is no research to date, prior to this project, on the psychology of the online dating romance scam. This study learnt about potential risk factors to this crime. We learnt that being high in romantic beliefs made individuals more vulnerable to this crime. However, importantly we learnt that there was little else that distinguished victims -- meaning that many types of people could fall victim to this crime.

4. Regulation bodies and authorities (e.g., ACCC in Australia)



Drawing from traditional psychological research on persuasive techniques we learnt about some of the persuasive strategies that scammers employ. What was especially unique about the research is that we learnt how the internet can be harnessed to create a fake identity and develop a 'hyper-personal' relationship with victims. 



Most victims (both financial victims and those who did not lose money) were stressed by the event and many were traumatised. Many experienced the loss of the relationship as a bereavement. The denial victims experienced made it difficult for them to accept the reality of the crime and sometimes made them vulnerable to a second wave of the crime. Often family and friends provided little or no support to victims making it more difficult for them to recover. Some victims transferred their love for the criminal to a law enforcement officer again making recovery difficult. We recommend that early psychology intervention is imperative for victims of this crime.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8DD38D20-E3A9-490F-A2D8-0719F359B86C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/media/research/research-groups/digital-identities-research-group/online-dating-romance-scam-project</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>First online dating romance scam court case dealt with by the UK and Ghana</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>90E6BD4C-C358-4EB3-BDB0-F0879E067A84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In November 2011 the first court case on the romance scam began where a suspect in Ghana is on trial for defrauding women in the UK.

At the beginning of the case the MET police spoke with Prof. Whitty to advise them on how to contact the victims (who were originally unaware they were victims) and how they should be treated. Prof Whitty emphasised that the victims would be originally in a state of denial and to be prepared to provide as much evidence as they could to help them believe the relationship was fraudulent. She advised that they could become suicidal and often family and friends would not provide support. Prof Whitty advised that they find available support agencies in the respective countries they were living in. She warned them that if a male officer was dealing with these female victims that it was likely that they would experience the 'transference effect'; that is because of the empathy displayed by the male officer, there was the risk that the women might transfer the love they felt from the criminal to the police officer. Given all of the above advise it was decided to bring a female Family Liaison Officer to deal with these victims after the police officer in charge of the case first contacted the women.

Given this case was going to court the police asked advice on how the women should provide statements. It was suggested that the victims should be treated as 'intimidated witnesses' in a similar way to victims of domestic violence. Given this it was decided to give the victims an option of a video statement, rather than having to appear in court. 

In addition Prof. Whitty's paper under review and report were presented to the judge to help assist in deciding a sentence. The judge did read these to help arrive at a decision. The sentence decided on was 6 yrs, 4 mnths, which the MET believed to be a good result.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/810C8F45-7726-4990-BD8A-CF092BA9FAE9"><gtr:id>810C8F45-7726-4990-BD8A-CF092BA9FAE9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mass-Marketing Fraud: A Growing Concern</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Security &amp;
