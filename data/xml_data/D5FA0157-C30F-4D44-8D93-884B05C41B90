It will incorporate and extend the work of eleven academics drawn from Computer Science, Oxford Internet Institute and Oxford e-Research centre, together with other Oxford Academics from as wide a spectrum of disciplines as we can manage. Mindful of the known difficulties of pursuing genuine inter-disciplinary research (including the challenges of finding funding, finding publication venues, and undertaking research recognised as leading-edge by each of the contributing disciplines), we have consulted at some length on the means to make such engagement fruitful. 
 
As a result, we anticipate that our new Centre will have both a real and a virtual existence. As a real centre, the Computer Science department provides office space - eventually co-located for all who wish to share expertise in Cyber Security Research. We intend to expand this to provide both laboratory space for experimental work with security systems, and also to host environments where usability experiments and evaluations can be undertaken. We will also offer to host visiting researchers from academia, industry, and government, and will hold short, intensive by-invitation workshops as the need arises. A measure of co-location of this kind is essential for the development of serendipitous conversations and research ideas. A virtual existence will enable us to integrate members of other departments into the Cyber Security activity, without forcing them to lose touch with their own disciplines. This is important both for individuals' own career development, but also in order that the best live scholarship can be brought to bear upon the difficult problems encountered in this domain. By actively maintaining these academic connections, we expect to be able to form collaborations to respond to new research challenges, and prospectively to explore and shape responses to open problems. As more and more disciplines - in academia and outside - depend on strong inter-connectivity and shared data, we see our existing shared activity across departments as a mere shadow of possible paths to impact in the future. 

As a centre of excellence, we will aim to be a principle point of contact for those inside and outside the University seeking to engage with leading research in Cyber Security. We will actively seek to develop new partnerships to embrace the range of disciplines necessary to make a significant impact in the improvement of theory, technology, techniques, policies and practice in cyber security.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main purpose of this ACE-CSR proposal is for impact. In addition to the pre-existing academic disciplines which benefit from the research through the usual means, the following beneficiaries exist:

* the wider academic community: the breath of concerns faced in the challenges of Cyber Security are not always appreciated by the academic community at large. Some may be undertaking research which might fall into this category, without realising it; others have techniques and expertise which could be brought to bear, but are unaware of the opportunities - for research funding and for engaging with real, pressing problems for society.

* the information security community: practitioners of security and vendors of solutions will always need to drawn on expertise which helps to address new and emerging threats - research which covers those topics which are not yet mundane or every-day in character. The centre will improve communication with this community - both for dissemination and for motivating new research.

* the public sector: by providing a flagship centre, the University will enable public bodies (as well as the private sector) better to understand the capabilities which it can offer and the partnerships which are possible - in some contexts, the University having much more flexibility in undertaking projects (unclassified projects with useful results for more high-assurance contexts, for example), or a range of untapped expertise hard to assemble elsewhere.

* the general public: the University takes seriously a public education and dissemination mission. Members of the University frequently participate in the Media in order to explain or comment upon issues of security or privacy - and how members of the public are impacted or can protect themselves. Through the better linkages and internal communications enabled by the centre, this public engagement will be strengthened.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50903</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>E-safety lessons</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5F1B0ED1-56AB-47B2-893E-40B9E3C3FE91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three members of the ACE network in Oxford delivered e-safety talks to local primary schools (years 5-6, two schools so far).

Singapore recently funded a large portfolio of Cyber Security Projects. Oxford staff were named as collaborators on several successful projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford Cyber Security Cluster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FFAD2840-3ED6-452D-85C1-DCA4E29BDC73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Oxford Cyber Security Cluster (part of the national UK Cyber Security Forum) meets regularly.

whereas in Oxford we emphasise critical thinking [i.e. knowing which tool to use for the job] and give all undergraduates some exposure to security and privacy).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>23000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
