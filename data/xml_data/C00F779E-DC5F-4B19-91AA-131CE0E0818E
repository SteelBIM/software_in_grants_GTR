&lt;p>From panel surveys,a lot can be learnt as long as the measurement of all topics of interest is without error. There are two sources of error that threaten to make panel data invalid and unreliable. First, nonresponse among specific respondents, and second errors in measurement of the topic of interest using survey questions.&lt;br />Survey methodologists worry that errors due to nonresponse and measurement interact. Some reasons for nonresponse might at the same time also be a reason for reporting with more measurement error. Lower cognitive abilities, complex income compositions, or language difficulties are among these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this research project, trade-offs and common causes for both nonresponse error and measurement error are studied using a Latent Variable modeling approach, using data from the British Household Panel Survey.&lt;br />&lt;br />Understanding the trade-off better will enable researchers to compare the nature and size of both errors, and make better informed decisions in trying to limit survey errors, and reduce the costs of trying to minimise such errors.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Longitudinal survey data are the source for many social scientists, economists, and policy makers who study or take policy-decisions regarding poverty, income and well-being. In the UK, research based on longitudinal surveys such as the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), the Birth Cohort Studies and the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA) has over many years had a huge impact on policy debates and policy decisions. This study should improve the quality of such data and of the research based upon those data. 

Specifically, any lessons regarding improved analysis approaches that better take into account measurement error, non-response error and the interaction between them will be of use to analysts across the broad range of disciplines that use longitudinal survey data, including sociology, economics, geography, psychology, politics, health sciences and demography. Although this includes research in academia, it also includes researchers in market-research and government agencies; for example the home office, and Office for National Statistics.

Market researchers and survey agencies perform much of the fieldwork for companies, government agencies and academia. Market researchers have over the years faced increasing pressure on the quality and costs of doing surveys. Because of increasing nonresponse rates and the higher survey costs associated with it, many market researchers have left traditional sampling methods, and have instead opted for using non-probability samples in the form of volunteer opt-in panels. Even within those panels however, nonresponse among panellists is a large problem. Market researchers are also worried about the answering behaviour of respondents in their panel surveys. Respondents often do not take the time and effort to complete surveys seriously, and instead opt for a strategy that takes the least effort against the least amount of time, resulting in strategies as &amp;quot;nondifferentiation&amp;quot;, &amp;quot; straightlining&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;speeding&amp;quot;.
Such undesirable answer strategies are often dealt with using 'ad hoc' methods. The guidelines that this project will produce will allow market researchers to easily study the extent of nonresponse and measurement error in their panel studies. The guidelines will enable market researchers to decide whether to convince unactive members to become active again, and whether measurement error really is as large as a problem as many suspect it is. Finally, market researchers will be able to use the guidelines to whether nonresponse or measurement error is the largest problem in their survey. The statistical models that this project will use are rather complicate for some people without a solid statistical background, The guidelines will be practical however so that everyone can use and implement them. If any statistical models are necessary, specific programming syntax for all major statistical packages will be added to the guideline as an appendix. To this end, we will actively work together with the Market Research Society (MRS) in designing and writing down these guidelines. We will also collaborate with the MRS to disseminate the guidelines to market researchers and survey agencies.

Government agencies will benefit from this project in two ways. First, by the improved data quality of the panel surveys it uses for decision making, leading to better informed policy-decisions. Second, by the lower costs of panel surveys, meaning that funding costs of future panel surveys will be lower. 

It should be noted that academic researchers will also benefit from improvements that are implemented by the non-academic sectors, notably government and private sector survey agencies. Academics use a lot of data collected outside of academia so the impacts on non-academic audiences (see &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot;) are highly relevant for academics too.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>129016</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Nonresponse workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D06BE8F5-3CD0-44B7-864E-3C2328646D86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion meeting of about 50 people from academia and national statistical offices, with the goal to exchange information on survey practice and theory.

Most notably attrition due to refusal by the respondent.
- Respondents who drop out from surveys have a different profile from respondents who continue to participate in panel surveys. The most notable differences between the two types are not merely demographic, but also psychographic. More conscientious and introvert people are more likely to become 'loyal' panel members.
- Item missings, and lower cooperation rates by the interviewer are good predictors of later dropout from a panel study.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings can be used to inform decision-making in so-called adaptive survey designs. These design gain a lot of interest in recent years from survey methodologists and survey practioners. The project has found for example that specific forms of attrition (due to noncontact, refusal etc.) can be predicted to a different extent. Refusals are the one cause for attrition that can be predicted fairly well. Using covariates, I have identified who will attrite.
