India's economic growth has been matched by rapid urban development in recent years; the urban landscape is being significantly re-modelled in line with the principles of New Urbanism - the creation of 'walkable,' diverse, inclusive, sustainable spaces where people will want to live both now and in the future. New large scale developments such as the case study community, Lavasa, are emerging to meet the demand for housing in the Indian context (c.300,000 residents). Future plans include the replication of Lavasa, providing homes to hundreds of thousands of families and individuals across the country, a move to attract individuals away from the clogged metropolitan cities of Delhi and Mumbai, to new urban environments. 

This research is a unique opportunity to gather empirical evidence of the day-to-day experiences, issues and needs of residents (children, young people and adults) living and moving through this new urban environment. The research is of international significance; current research into the lives of families in large scale, inclusive, sustainable communities is lacking, particularly in the context of an emerging superpower. The research predominantly uses qualitative research methods; however, an innovative mobile 'app' will be developed to further explore and map family mobility within the community. There are three interlinked strands to the research:

Internationalising New Urbanism: 
Primarily, this strand aims to create a dialogue of exchange between those engaged in sustainable urbanism in the UK context (primarily those involved in the creation of 'sustainable communities', albeit on a smaller scale) and those creating new communities in India. What lessons can be learnt from applying the principles of New Urbanism (essentially American and European informed), are there specific design features and points of best practice which can be transferred between these communities and contexts? 

Sustainable design and mobility - everyday routines, transport and access: 
This strand will explore family mobility in the context of this new urban environment; a landscape which has been designed in line with principles of sustainability and effective transport use. How are residents moving through and interacting with their environment during their everyday routines? Given that its design has been planned so that 'all components of essential city life are located within walking distance,' is car use minimised within this context? Given the plethora of services and amenities Lavasa provides, how are these connected and used in the rhythm of everyday life? Efficient connectivity is a key principle of the urban infrastructure in Lavasa. This strand aims to explore the successes and limitations of Lavasa's connectivity.

Nature and green space in a planned city: 
Following on from the previous objective, this strand aims to explore the impact of green and public space on the lives of children, young people and their families living in the community. Nature and green space are important and educational; they are interactive elements of the planned city. How are these spaces being used in the everyday life of residents? Are children and young people free to explore the nature and open space which has been planned into their neighbourhood?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research objectives are not intended for single audiences; they are interrelated and will be of significant interest to a wide range of local and international stakeholders. In addition to the enhancement of academic knowledge, outlined elsewhere in the proposal, this research has relevance to a wider audience:

Practitioners and stakeholders: Planners; Urban Designers; Community workers; Play workers; Local Councillors; Private Sector Developers; Local Government; National Government. 

Engaging with practitioners: Working in partnership with urban practitioners is a central aim of this research project. Relations with urban designers, architects and planners in the UK context have already been forged through previous work on the New Urbanisms, New Citizens ESRC project, this work will extend this network and conversation to the Indian context. For high impact research, strong relationships with stakeholders working in the field are essential. There will be two workshop events, one based in India and the other in the UK, these will be networking events for practitioners based in the field of urban design, urban living and mobility. 

Benefit: The project has the support of Lavasa Corporation Limited (see attached letter), this relationship is vital for the dissemination of outputs and for meaningful impact (particularly given the plans to replicate Lavasa). This will be a significant pathway for ensuring the results of this project are taken into account for future large scale developments in both the India and potentially in the wider emerging market context (medium and long term impact). The project has the potential to increase the effectiveness of newly built communities, considering service provision, individual mobility, sustainable transport and access to nature and green space (for both future phases of the Lavasa development and other planned large scale communities). In terms of the UK context, where large scale new build developments are on the agenda, this research has the potential to inform and advise on examples of best practice from an international setting; consulting on local government development plans and informing those in policy settings for housing provision and the creation of liveable communities.

Local community: Participants of the research; children and young people; local residents; local businesses and services. 

Engaging with communities: Developing methodologies and engagement tools for working with communities, particularly children and young people, in the context of urban planning and design is an important element of the project. I have experience in running community based workshops with young people in the UK context and hope to transfer this knowledge and practice to the Indian context.

Benefit: Developing guidance for practitioners working in the field (in India), in terms of local consultation and particularly working with young people is important and this could have significant impact in terms of future engagement in the community. Engaging with residents in the form of participatory workshops can have significant self-and localised impact (providing a forum for individuals to have a stake, a say in their community). The project has the potential to stimulate change in terms of urban design and perceptions of local engagement, for both existing and future residents of large scale developments. In terms of a wider community impact, the research will be engaging with stakeholders who can make changes to policy, design and consultation; thus, the research has the potential to contribute to community well-being and quality of life, both in existing communities and those living in future areas of large scale development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>222329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The researchers put together a school based exhibition for participants and the wider community to engage with the research findings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B83FFAB5-9B17-4ED8-AE3F-BF0250610E7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The school based display prompted wider discussion about the research findings and exposed the work of young people in the planning and design of new urban spaces.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>New Urbanisms in India: Project exhibition (1: Local school)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the 'New Urbanisms in India' research project, children and young people were involved in the building of a city model using recycled materials.

In relation to practitioners and stakeholders (urban designers, community workers, local councillors, private sector developers, local and national government) the research team has engaged with such stakeholders since the outset of the project, which has provided fertile ground for the recommendation and implementation of research findings. The Lavasa Corporation has been a significant stakeholder from the outset and the project is continuing to have impact on changed perceptions and practices in relation to urban development (in terms of recommendations for education provision, mobility, access to services and facilities and experiences of nature in urban spaces). Impacts have been noted with regard to changed perceptions and ways of working (in terms of designing child-friendly spaces). 

The research team are pursuing multiple networks in terms of the delivery of the Smart City agenda in India, speaking with stakeholders about the implementation of project findings which relate to the broader urban transformation agenda. 

The research team is also engaged on an international scale with UN-Habitat on the development of metadata for Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 11.3.2, with a specific focus on citizen participation in urban planning, directly drawing on the research from this project. 

Significant developments were made in the design and implementation of new technological tools for social science research. An app, 'Map My Community', was designed as an innovative mapping tool to capture data on young people and their families' mobilities, their access to services and everyday experiences of their local environment. The data gave extraordinary insight into everyday routines, marginal spaces and spatio-temporalities of life in a new urban development. The data also gave access to interior, private spaces and moments which are normally difficult to access in social science research - favourite spaces, family routines and habits. Map My Community has three research-led features: Map my week, Capture that and Explore that space. In addition to advancing methodological capabilities, the research has raised new questions with regard to the ethical complexities of technological tools in research with young people. The research tool has since been implemented (in collaboration with the researchers) by an NGO in Delhi, using the innovative tool in their work with children and young people, to advocate for improved living conditions in Delhi's informal settlements. The work through using the app has led to changes on the ground in these communities (from the implementation of sewerage systems, opening up of toilet facilities and the allocation of resources for children's play spaces. The app has received widespread attention, internationally, as a tool which has the potential for citizen participation in a diverse range of contexts and communities. Opportunities for further collaboration are being pursued. The wider use of this app demonstrates good value for money and the potential for impact broader than the initial scope of the project. The app design is currently being used by other researchers in other international contexts.

The research process has opened up a significant network of collaborative partnerships with NGOs, local governments, private corporations and international agencies working on inclusive, participatory, urban development processes and practices.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0A639124-65AB-466E-B177-DA891C6B93A5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The New Urbanisms in India research project investigated the everyday lives of children, young people and their families living in a site of urban change in India. Through an extensive period of ethnographic fieldwork (January - November 2015) and use of mixed, innovative methodologies (individual in-depth interviews, guided walks, creative methods, focus groups, community based workshops and the use of a mobile app 'Map My Community'), data was collected from 350 children, young people and their families. The research and findings offer a major insight into the everyday lives of children and their families at a site of urban transformation in India through the delivery of the core project objectives. Significant new knowledge has been generated about the lived experience of urban change. Twelve core themes emerged from the analysis: education provision; (dis)connection; a place in the making; nature and green space; experiences of play; being and feeling safe; experiencing inequality; opportunities; tourism vs. living; being part of urban change; lived experience of financial turmoil and imagining a future (the final project report can be accessed here: www.new-urbanism-india.com). 

A series of policy recommendations have been proposed to be considered by governments, policy makers, developers and urban planners who are embarking on or involved in planning urban futures:

- Connections between the rural and the urban are vital for pathways of social and economic prosperity. Small towns and villages are core components of urban life; connections (roads and pavements) should be made and maintained.
- A diverse education portfolio must be at the heart of any urban transformation strategy. Sites of education connect young people to place and enable families to commit to sites of urban change.
- Spaces of interaction are key sites of belonging and community building. It is essential to integrate spaces for people to sit, eat, walk and play throughout the development (both indoor and outdoor).
- When translocating urban design features across contexts and communities, the design and physical properties of materials need to be compatible with the local environment. It is important to also acknowledge the socio-cultural context in the translocation process.
- It is important to recognise the significance of water for wellbeing (beyond its requirement for survival), providing spaces for recreation and interactions with water, avoiding the privatisation of such spaces.
- Urban planning should have nature as a key component for the wellbeing of urban dwellers. A diversity of natural spaces are needed, from planned nature trails to informal spaces for people to interact with nature.
- Play spaces are important for young people's everyday lives and careful consideration needs to be given to their safe location, walkability and accessibility for all young people.
- When planning, building and transforming urban spaces, developers and policies need to be sympathetic to the landscape of memories which families and communities hold.
- Urban agendas need to be inclusive in terms of who is counted as a citizen and actively seek opportunities for utilising local resources, skills, labour and knowledge in urban development.
- New urban spaces, whether they be entirely new cities or sites of urban change should not be visioned, designed and built without considering the everyday lives, needs and desires of children, young people and their families. Opportunities for citizen participation needs to be at the core of urban agendas.

The research process has opened up a significant network of collaborative partnerships with NGOs, local governments, private corporations and international agencies working on inclusive, participatory, urban development processes and practices. The research findings are being considered by a range of local, national and international agencies with regard to policy implications in the context of a New Urban Agenda (UN-Habitat). 

During the process of fieldwork, local students and researchers were trained in qualitative research with children and young people, ethical research practice and the use of technological tools in the field. There was a sustained effort at capacity building across the wider research team.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are multiple Pathways to Impact being pursued to ensure that the research findings detailed in the final report have maximum impact, academically and in terms of influencing policy and practice with regard to the urban transformation agenda and impact on young people and families' lives.

The app collates data on where they go, how they travel and their local experiences. There are three methodological components:
 
i) 'Map my Week', gathers data on participants' everyday life, mobility and use of community space. Outdoor movements will be tracked for a one week period and at regular intervals participants will be prompted to take part in short surveys to ask where they are, who they are with and how they got there. This will be translated back to the designers of these urban spaces, improving and modifying for future residents of new city developments.

ii) 'Explore that Space', enables the research team to pre-define specific areas of the urban environment to prompt information from users (i.e. a park, streets or open space). The app will poll for a participant's position (through their device's GPS), detecting whether they have entered a pre-defined area and then request the completion of a short survey.
