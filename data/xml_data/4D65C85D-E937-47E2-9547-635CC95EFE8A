The research program is entitled 'The production and application of Japanese alloys and patination' and will run from May 2007- April 2010. \n\nIn this application we seek funding to support research into the application of the niiro patination technique which is used to patinate irogane alloys. This research was outlined in the original fellowship application and is central to the overall research program. Funding from AHRC will ensure that the research is carried out to the highest quality. \n\nThe Western tradition of metal patination and colouring is based on the use of a small range of metals and alloys which are coloured by the application of a wide range of patination solutions. In contrast to this, Japanese metalworkers developed a wide range of irogane alloys which are coloured with a single patination solution (the niiro eki or boiling colour solution). This approach allows different alloys to be combined in one piece and patinated, producing a multi-coloured piece of metalwork.\n\nThere are several barriers to consistent niiro patination. For example, the frequent 'patchiness' of the colour obtained results in time consuming re-polishing and re-patination. Variations in colour and colour consistency make the planning of a workpiece difficult. There is disagreement amongst Japanese craftspeople on the optimum composition and correct application of the niiro patination solution. In this study we aim to develop a reliable and easy-to-use patination process using standard ingredients available in the UK.\n\nThe research will ask:\n\n1. How should the surface be prepared prior to patination to ensure even patination?\n\n2. How can we optimize the ingredients and composition of the niiro solution to achieve good patination on the alloys prepared in our earlier study?\n\n3. How should we apply the patination solution to the alloys?\n\n4. What is the full range of colours that we can achieve with the niiro patination solution?\n\nIt is proposed to study the effects of niiro colouration on the alloys developed in the previous proposal, paying particular attention to the performance of alloys produced and finished by hand and by semi-commercial processes. Traditional niiro solutions and solutions made with laboratory or commercial grade chemical agents will be tested on both samples and studio work, and any differences between them will be characterised. \n\nA limited number of researchers have published work on the chemistry of niiro patinated surfaces, on surface preparation, and on substitutes for some parts of the traditional recipes. However, a full understanding of the process and the variations that occur is still to be achieved.\n\nThe research will be located at Sheffield Hallam University using the facilities and expertise of the Art and Design Research Centre (ADRC) and the Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI). There is a strong team of highly experienced and internationally recognised Metalwork and Jewellery staff at ADRC to support the research. MERI has the background of precious metals research, and the extensive equipment and materials characterisation techniques essential to support this research. \n\nPapers will be submitted to scientific, design and craft related journals and at least two conferences. The University website will be utilized for the publication of papers etc. Commercial collaborators will be sought through SHU to exploit any materials or processes that are developed.\n\nThis project is a fundamental part of the larger research programme as understanding and control of the niiro solution is crucial to the patination of the irogane alloys. The niiro solution will be tested under laboratory conditions and through studio work. A combination of laboratory based testing on small samples with practice based testing on larger workpieces in the studio will allow for a through study of niiro patination.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>16403</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Seven Smiths: new work in metal and silver

13 November - 31 December 2007

Seven Smiths brings together the new work of seven of the UK's leading silversmiths. Each has exhibited widely both in the UK and internationally, and between them their work is represented in most of the major public collections. Blackwell, filled with exquisite handwork in wood, stone and plaster, provides the peculiarly fitting backdrop for these new examples of an age-old craft. Some of the pieces made for Seven Smiths have evolved as a direct response to the Arts and Crafts Movement, the house and its spectacular setting.

Silversmith/designer Coilin O'Dubhghaill studied for a doctorate in Tokyo, where he mastered a range of techniques using coloured metal inlays, or irogane, which he now uses in combination to create vessel forms with an emphasis on surface pattern and colour. He is currently a research fellow at Sheffield Hallam University, researching the production and application of Japanese alloys, such as the copper/gold shakudo alloy, and their patination.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DD23A2E-9D0E-4F81-96AD-1DCC1C927283</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Seven Smiths, Blackwell, Bowness-on-Windermere</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.blackwell.org.uk/exhibitions/seven-smiths-new-work-metal-and-silver</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2007</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The award was a national biennial event, sponsored by Yorkshire South Tourism, in partnership with Yorkshire Forward and South Yorkshire Objective 1.

From Richard Rabel's blog discussing the Five into Four exhibition:

C?il?n ? Dubhghaill is one of the brilliant young designers keeping alive the age-old tradition of silversmithing. There are too few artists like him, so we must show our support for ? Dubhghaill! His works have a noticeably Eastern influence and that is no coincidence - he studied in Japan and received a doctorate for research into traditional Japanese metalwork techniques (the Japanese have a marvelous history of incorporating different metals into stunning pieces). One of my favorite pieces in this show is his &amp;quot;Ritual 9&amp;quot;. Taking a cue from traditional Japanese koros, this vessel has the most beautiful speckled finish. The paper-thin silver is also an amazing contrast to what appears to be a very weighty object.

Another of his works in the show is this elegant bowl &amp;quot;Ceo 7&amp;quot;. Fashioned from a copper and gold alloy, I first took this for pottery until I looked closer. An &amp;quot;? Dubhghaill&amp;quot; piece for sure, I thought, this time working outside of silver to create this earthy, yet sophisticated piece. While we mere mortals would think working with copper or silver is the same, the talent in bringing these two different pieces to such a high level of perfection and beauty is actually quite a feat!</gtr:description><gtr:id>6CC5F5B7-EF3B-462F-9A6A-3903B7B82F31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this exhibition was purchased for the Irish State Art Collection.

The project was initiated by Coilin O'Dubhghaill and developed in collaboration with Maria Hanson and Christoph Zellweger. The project was described in detail in the publication: HANSON, Maria and WOOD, Nicola (2010). KeyPiece: Creating a critical dialogue in contemporary craft; Design and craft: A history of convergences and divergences: 7th Conference of Design History and Design Studies (ICDHS), Brussels, Belgium, 20-22 September 2010. 

The exhibited pieces provided the basis for discussion between the makers, along with other pieces brought along by the makers that were considered significant but not necessarily suitable for exhibition. The question of how a keypiece can be identified and defined led the makers to develop an understanding of the different roles objects they make play within their practice. 

The participants were: Lionel Dean, Coilin O'Dubhghaill, Sara O'Hana, Maria Hanson, Grace Horn, Antje Illner, Drummond Masterson, Tine de Ruysser, Lucian Taylor and Christoph Zellweger.

The aim of the exhibition is to visualise and articulate the complex, multi-faceted and often non-linear creative journey that individual researchers make to get to the final object. It built upon and extended the enquiry started during the KeyPiece exhibition and research event in 2009 where the exhibited objects devoid of any textural explanation provided the basis for intensive critical discourse between participants in order to reveal the embedded knowledge. By presenting a range of tangible textual and non-textual material, Beneath the Skin aims to elicit and reveal the knowledge embodied by the object and proposed that there are intangible aspects within creative research that are not possible to quantify.

This research tests the application of irogane alloy and newly developed synthetic niiro patination techniques through the production of a series of decorative vessels. By introducing Japanese alloys into the domain of the traditional silversmith, this work also challenges perceptions of fine crafted metal objects, disregarding hierarchies of value set up by precious metal commodity markets and the institution of the hallmark. 

Resulting from the application of material and process knowledge developed during earlier laboratory based testing these artefacts are an outcome from the practiced based study into Japanese metalworking techniques. (Irogane alloys and niiro patination).Small scale laboratory samples produced consistent results with the synthetic niiro solution but full exploration of the material and process properties and behaviours required extensive large scale craft workshop activity. Through this ongoing series of vessels, utilising hand forged hammer techniques and fabrication; creative possibilities have been explored by combining an extended range of irogane alloys beyond the standard palette usually encountered. The intrinsic material qualities and subtle variations of colours have been further exploited through surface enrichment and selective polishing resulting in surface finishes with new variegated colours.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DEF79819-BF07-43CE-9028-34233EC9A5B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work from this collection was purchased for the Marzee collection, Netherlands in 2012.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Coilin O'Dubhghaill at Galerie Marzee, Netherlands</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of vessels produced as a result of the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F7AC9E5-F708-4E63-828F-03F23B56B4BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>KunstRAI, Amsterdam (2012)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of vessels produced as a result of the research program.</gtr:description><gtr:id>46357435-821A-47A3-8CF7-0AF6D64275A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>European networking</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Frame at Schmuck, Internationale Handwerks Messe, Munich, 2013</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The fair is a platform for the latest limited editions and one-offs from well-known and upcoming designers working in different design disciplines and various materials.

These were compared with results for standard polishing materials aluminium oxide and silicon carbide. A system for polishing and cleaning test pieces has been developed based on this work.

Traditional ingredients used in the niiro patination process have been studied including daikon radish, rokusho verdegris and plum vinegar.

The application of grated daikon radish to the alloys before patination has been studied. A reduction in the formation of silver chlorides on fine silver and shibuichi has been identified as the main positive benefit in the use of daikon. A number of possible active ingredients in the daikon radish have been identified, further testing will be needed in this area.

Rokusho has been tested and found to contain copper acetate, sodium chloride and calcium carbonate. The presence of salt and calcium carbonate has not been reported extensively in the previous literature on the subject. Lead, tin and zinc are also present in rokusho at significant levels, the presence of which could be a barrier to the use of niiro in the West. The development of a 'safe' solution is desirable.

The effect of plum vinegar on niiro has been studied, and the resultant formation of chlorides on fine silver and shibuichi has been identified. Although the plum vinegar can 'improve' the colour of niiro patinated copper (bright red/brown rather than dull brown), the formation of chlorides on silver and shibuichi (yellow/brown colour rather than white or grey colour) is not a desirable result. Active ingredients in plum vinegar such as citric acid, malic acid, and sodium chloride have been identified and testing is underway to characterize the effect of these ingredients individually.

Traditional niiro solutions and solutions made with commercial grade chemical agents were tested on sample alloys and the differences between them were characterised. A systematic method of recording and quantifying the colours produced by niiro patination has been developed and a database of alloys, niiro compositions, conditions of immersion and colours has been produced and will be used in further work and in comparison with other research.

Through this research we have characterized the various pre-patination polishing techniques, clarified the composition of traditional solution ingredients, developed and tested a solution made from commercial grade chemicals, and described the influence of solution ingredients on patination colour. Overall the research has greatly improved our understanding of the niiro patination process and clarified the areas that will require further exploration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DBCB6DFE-A7BF-4C81-B7F2-722F56779565</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Manufacturing/ including Industrial Biotechology,Culture/ Heritage/ Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F99D707C-42EB-4353-B211-8AEB53554B04"><gtr:id>F99D707C-42EB-4353-B211-8AEB53554B04</gtr:id><gtr:title>Japanese irogane alloys and patination - a study of production and application</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Twenty-Third Santa Fe Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751"><gtr:id>7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coilin O'Dubhghaill (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B5A480AF-FADC-4710-93BD-471B31FF5557"><gtr:id>B5A480AF-FADC-4710-93BD-471B31FF5557</gtr:id><gtr:title>Original research into Japanese alloys and patination</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Goldsmiths' Company Technical Bulletin</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751"><gtr:id>7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coilin O'Dubhghaill (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/91778389-9543-4581-BCD9-6FB975EE86E7"><gtr:id>91778389-9543-4581-BCD9-6FB975EE86E7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metal Mosaics: Customizing designs with homemade shibuichi and shakudo</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>MJSA Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751"><gtr:id>7fa0eebd0f0a9027b97fad463f814751</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coilin O'Dubhghaill (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/883624D0-8929-4381-ABB0-67B762AB36A7"><gtr:id>883624D0-8929-4381-ABB0-67B762AB36A7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reliable Irogane Alloys and Niiro Patination- Further Study of Production and Application to Jewelry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Santa Fe Symposium in Albuquerque, New Mexico</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872"><gtr:id>cfbf495411f888acc0f6efe617e84872</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>A.H.
