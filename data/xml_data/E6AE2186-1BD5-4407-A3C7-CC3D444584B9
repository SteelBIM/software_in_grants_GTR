The significance of computer software, and the codes and algorithmic processes in which it is written and programmed to act, is particularly vivid from an educational perspective. Technically, code instructs software how to act, but as code increasingly comes to saturate our world, as an invisible presence in everyday life, it also instructs people to do things. Code acts back on us as the lessons written down in the languages of computer programming, and as an algorithmic curriculum instructing us in new ways of thinking and acting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Code Acts in Education seminar series focuses on education as a specific field in which the problems associated with code are now part of an emerging public policy agenda and media debate. Over a series of six events, the seminar series will provide a critical exploration of computer code in order to build greater public awareness of its influence on how we act, think, and conduct ourselves, and to inform and augment the existing debate about the importance of teaching children and young people to be able to program and understand computer code.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

Educators including teachers and curriculum developers in schools, further education colleges and universities. This group also includes professional bodies that support the work of teachers, such as Education Scotland.

Policymakers focused on skill development and education, such as representatives of Skills Development Scotland, Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, as well as Scottish Government (education) and the UK Department for Education.

Public policymakers in Scotland and across the UK concerned with promoting digital engagement, usually to improve employability and quality of life, support communities, boost economic growth and increase productivity and innovation. Specifically, these users include representatives of the Scottish government (those engaged with Scotland's Digital Future: A Strategy, and the Scotland Futures Forum); the UK government (the Government Digital Strategy), and the Welsh government (Delivering a Digital Wales Strategy). 

Intermediate third sector organisations promoting digital fluency, digital skills and capacity to code, particularly among children and youth. These organisations include Demos, Nominet Trust (which funds research that promotes digital capacity among disadvantaged children), Mozilla Foundation, and providers of educative materials to promote digital capacity, such as Raspberry Pi. They also include Nesta which has a broader mandate, specifically to generate innovation by promoting digital making, digital R&amp;amp;D, and digital education.

Professional bodies that promote standards of practice for professionals, and that provide professional development opportunities which increasingly promote digital literacy and adoption of digital technologies in practice, are also beneficiaries. In the first instance these groups include professional bodies serving teachers. However more broadly, we will be advertising this seminar series through our networks of professional bodies in nursing, medicine, social work and policing who are now linked with us in research and knowledge exchange initiatives to improve professional education and learning.

Broader public users include parents, employers and community members concerned with issues of digital engagement, digital skills development, and issues of digital code: how computer code shapes everyday life and lifelong learning, while opening new knowledge practices and forms of work.

How will they benefit from this research?

Advisory Group: We intend to assemble an Advisory Group comprised of key representatives from each of the user groups listed above. A key purpose of this Advisory Group is to help maximize the impact of this seminar series through specific input in identifying specific objectives, audiences, messages and channels for communicating findings and dialogues of the series. Members of the Advisory Group will be asked to attend as many seminars as possible and to work with the research team (including the investigators and four doctoral students) to draw together key themes and questions across the seminar activities. Members will be asked to mobilize their own networks and to suggest specific knowledge exchange activities to help engage their users in the seminar outcomes in the most productive ways.

Educational benefits: Most groups in this list are interested in influencing education, particularly of children and youth for developing digital capacity and critical digital literacy in learning to code and learning through code. This series will produce better understanding for all of the issues at stake, the skills required, the initiatives underway, and the pedagogies that can best enhance education for digital futures. Further, the series creates opportunities among highly diverse perspectives and sectoral interests to share perspectives, challenges and resources towards improving digital education through a focus on the problem of code.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29702</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference paper by B Williamson on neurocomputation and education at Theorising Digital Society (University of Canberra, Australia)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AECD7142-B968-4E3A-A9DA-84C4298C8985</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper at an Australian conference, generated questions and debate</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference paper by L Grant on 'constructions of the datafied child' at Data Power Conference, Sheffield, 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3786C407-970B-4DF6-BFC0-76B1F641DDE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A conference paper at a major conference on the power of data in society, which generated questions and debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote lecture (Sian Bayne) at European MOOCs Stakeholder Summit, Belgium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>565850FE-DB05-4927-BBA8-F73B226CFCB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Practitioners of learning at scale across Europe attended and engaged in discussion relating to critical approaches to teacher automation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.emoocs2015.eu</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference paper by B Williamson on computer programming in schools at Researching Work and Learning conference (Stirling Uni)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DC832AA2-E2F0-44F6-886F-1F62440822A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper, generated questions and debate</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Opinion piece by B Williamson in ESRC Britain in 2016 magazine on commercial parrticipation in the new Computing curriculum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12326835-BA88-4CE0-B590-ADE9E74733EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An online version of the piece was widely circulated on social media.

In particular, Williamson's updates on his research on the behaviour change app ClassDojo has itself been accessed over 5,000 times in 2016. In 2016, Code Acts in Education was listed by Ed-Tech Magazine as a 'Top 50 Must-Read' on education technology issues (http://www.edtechmagazine.com/higher/article/2016/05/higher-ed-must-read-it-blogs). This accolade has generated considerable visibility among educational technology practitioners and developers for research findings emerging from Code Acts, with users referred to its site directly from the Ed-Tech website.

In August 2015 the Code Acts in Education team produced an open access e-book based on the series and their related research. Entitled Coding/Learning: Software and digital data in education, it has been accessed 1,165 times and has been included as a resource on Make Things Do Stuff, a public-facing website of resources for practitioners on education and technology created by innovation charity Nesta. 

PI Williamson has also contributed regularly to the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub throughout the duration of the project (http://dmlcentral.net/person/ben-williamson/). DML is an initiative of a major US-based Connected Learning initiative funded by the MacArthur Foundation, which is leading in the development of practices and knowledge related to educational technology in the era of connected technologies. Williamson has translated the findings from the series and his associated research into more than 20 posts for its global audience of educational practitioners, technology developers and researchers. His posts on big data in education, kids coding, behaviour change programs, artificial intelligence in education, social media platforms and learning, and the role of tech-entrepreneurs in setting up new schools have been widely circulated via social media.

One of the priority areas identified during the seminar series was how children are being encouraged to learn to code. PI Williamson undertook extensive documentary research to trace the networks of organizations involved in promoting coding and computing the children. As a result, Williamson was invited to a teleconference meeting with SpinWatch, the non-profit organization which focuses on the networks of powerful individuals and institutions shaping the public agenda. SpinWatch is currently exploring the lobbying groups and commercial interests involved in the formation of computing as a subject in the National Curriculum; Williamson contributed the results of his research to assist this project. As a further result of this research, Williamson was invited to contribute an opinion piece to Britain in 2016, the annual ESRC magazine on the impact of social science to the UK, where he detailed the commercial technology interests behind new computing programmes of study in the National Curriculum. Williamson also published an article in The Conversation focused on the role of technology businesses in the establishment of new free schools and academy schools in England (https://theconversation.com/beware-the-digital-entrepreneurs-who-are-opening-their-own-schools-54626). The article was translated into German and reproduced in the online magazine Netzpiloten (http://www.netzpiloten.de/unternehmer-livingstone-bildungspolitik-schulen-eroeffnung/). 

Algorithms have emerged as a subject of serious social concern in recent years. Code Acts in Education explored the role of algorithms in reshaping education, and led to detailed research by PI Williamson on algorithmic data analytics in schools, by CI Edwards on the algorithmic structuring of 'open education,' by CI Fenwick on the influence of analytics on professional learning, and by CI Bayne on algorithmic software 'bots' in online HE courses. As a consequence, Williamson was invited to consult on the Shadow of the Smart Machines initiative by Nesta, the charity focused on innovation in government and public services. Nesta is, at the time of reporting, considering commissioning further research on the role of algorithmic analytics in education. Williamson contributed to shaping the agenda through teleconference call and the production of a briefing paper based on research findings from the Code Acts in Education project. Williamson was also invited to produce an article for the LSE Impact of Social Sciences blog, where he detailed how algorithmic processes are intervening in Higher Education practices (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/02/10/the-death-of-the-theorist-in-digital-social-research/). Late in 2016, Williamson was invited to be an expert participant in a two-day workshop on 'Technological Sovereignty' hosted by the Mayor of Barcelona and organized by prominent technology journalist Evgeny Morozov.

PI Williamson has focused significant attention on the education business Pearson during the Code Acts in Education project. After publishing an article about Pearson's move to use big data in education, Williamson was approached by Pearson to engage in a dialogue about their activities. This dialogue took the form of a series of blog posts by Williamson and Pearson staff (http://blog.pearson.com/educational-data-pearson-and-the-theory-gap/). This forum allowed Williamson to share his research findings with the commercial subjects of the research and with its global audience of customers and users.

Policy Innovation Labs have emerged during the project as significant actors influencing how digital technologies and big data are being positioned in education. On the basis of his published research on policy labs, PI Williamson was invited to participate in the Global Lab Gathering 2015, an international conference for policy lab leaders organized by Nesta in London and attended by over 300 delegates. The only academic speaker out of a list of over 30 speakers (http://www.nesta.org.uk/events/labworks-2015-speakers), Williamson joined a panel discussion about policy networks and promoted research collaboration between policy labs and Higher Education researchers to address complex social problems. He especially encouraged the policy labs community to address the issue of 'policy learning'--Nesta has since established an 'i-School' initiative for policy learning across innovation labs and government departments, crediting insights presented at the conference with its development (http://www.nesta.org.uk/project/i-school). Williamson subsequently produced an open access working paper on policy labs (published on the Code Acts website), and his writing on policy innovation labs has been shared widely via Nesta in the UK (http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/lab-notes-june-edition) and twice by the GovLab in the US (http://thegovlab.org/governing-methods-policy-innovation-labs-design-and-data-science-in-the-digital-governance-of-education/; http://thegovlab.org/testing-governance-the-laboratory-lives-and-methods-of-policy-innovation-labs/). 

In sum, Code Acts in Education has led to considerable public engagement beyond academic impacts, and extended the findings from the seminar series and the investigators' associated research to diverse audiences. We are optimistic that as the seminar series leads next into further research that further lasting impact will be generated as we make use of our findings to shape debates and practices in relation to the use of advanced software and digital data in education.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8FCDE8DF-C2A5-4967-AF38-94E88902D03F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has generated significant new research findings, built new relationships and networks, and opened up new lines of inquiry in four key areas. 

1 Software code, algorithms and digital data systems are reworking education. The researchers examined the effects on education of learning analytics and adaptive learning platforms designed for use in classrooms and online courses, the emergence of tracking apps used to monitor student performance, massively open online courses (MOOCs), and the use of automated bots as teaching assistants. The researchers also studied how predictive analytics with associated data systems and digital devices are transforming professional work, and identified important consequences for professional learning and education. These technologies represent an emerging new form of 'smarter learning software' that is designed to be aware of itself, that can adapt to its user, and that can semi-automate the pedagogic routines of the digitally-augmented classroom and online course. The project has shown where and how these technologies are proliferating in educational contexts, and examined positive and negative possibilities for learners, educators and policymakers.

2 Education is being reimagined for smart cities. As urban environments have become more augmented by coded technologies and data-driven, this project has opened up new lines of inquiry into the future of education in smart cities. This has involved an investigation of how commercial vendors such as IBM are reimagining education and learning in computational urban environments, and how local government initiatives have sought to educate 'smart citizens' with the digital skills and data analysis capacities required for participation in smart cities. 

3 Education policy making is being shaped by new data processing platforms and actors. Software systems and digital data platforms are now being put to work in the policymaking machinery of education. Large-scale global databanks, real-time data analysis, data visualization and predictive analytics technologies are being put to work to conduct a constant analysis of education systems, institutions and individuals. This is being driven by new kinds of non-governmental actors. Companies such as Pearson, Google and IBM, along with entrepreneurs advocating for the digital economy, are now actively intervening in education policy decision-making. At the same time, new public policy innovation labs such as Nesta (UK) and the GovLab (US) are becoming significant influences on the future direction of education.

4 Learning to code has moved from the margins to mainstream schools policy. A significant strand of the project has focused on the emergence of 'learning to code' and 'digital making' as new movements in education. This has traced cross-sector networks of governmental, commercial and civil society actors that promote programming to young people. Learning to code has become central to ambitions to develop digital citizens who can contribute to the digital economy and participate in new digital government services.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project findings and inter-disciplinary researcher/user networks are already driving further work. Through project contacts, Williamson is now co-I on an inter-disciplinary research proposal to investigate data literacies. Williamson and Edwards are invited to support a major US-based research proposal. Bayne has established the Digital Education Research Centre at the University of Edinburgh, with Williamson, Edwards and Fenwick as associated members, to pursue key issues arising from this project and build new networks for further research. 

The project's engagement with third sector organisations has emphasized the importance of collaborative ethnographic research with policy innovation labs. This engagement shows signs of influencing the practices of such labs and opening new lines of research, e.g. Williamson's research on policy innovation labs has been widely circulated via Nesta (UK) and GovLab (US) to their networks of partners, practitioners, and policy influencers. Similar possibilities are arising from engagement with commercial organisations, such as Pearson, which has expressed interest in pursuing issues raised by the project and circulated research by Williamson to its global network.

The project has extended others' use of the findings through wide-ranging use of social media, involving intermediaries such as the Digital Media and Learning Research Hub in the USA &amp;amp; LSE Impact of Social Sciences blog in UK. Our own Code Acts in Education website has received over 20,000 views from 13,000 visitors since September 2013.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1E182D69-BF06-4D2C-B39A-0729CC968EEC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://codeactsineducation.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/20DCDAE1-6D57-4B19-8EE9-F5CC98C21D1B"><gtr:id>20DCDAE1-6D57-4B19-8EE9-F5CC98C21D1B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Social media, professionalism and higher education: a sociomaterial consideration</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Higher Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01"><gtr:id>950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fenwick T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2862D645-88AE-4E51-B103-F4B8EA9CC659"><gtr:id>2862D645-88AE-4E51-B103-F4B8EA9CC659</gtr:id><gtr:title>Professional Responsibility and Professionalism: A Sociomaterial Examination</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01"><gtr:id>950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fenwick T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C4E2D37A-A8A1-447D-BCDF-AEE3D42D9A38"><gtr:id>C4E2D37A-A8A1-447D-BCDF-AEE3D42D9A38</gtr:id><gtr:title>Political computational thinking: policy networks, digital governance and 'learning to code'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Critical Policy Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9bdfee87c8018d4536157eda87453e9"><gtr:id>b9bdfee87c8018d4536157eda87453e9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Williamson B</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E59ABED3-36C4-4F07-95B0-9146A57CAA32"><gtr:id>E59ABED3-36C4-4F07-95B0-9146A57CAA32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital analytics in professional work and learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Continuing Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/963bbeaf786a155480b5ecdd01376946"><gtr:id>963bbeaf786a155480b5ecdd01376946</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Edwards R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/84EAE84E-6BC5-4977-80B0-190302357449"><gtr:id>84EAE84E-6BC5-4977-80B0-190302357449</gtr:id><gtr:title>Teacherbot: interventions in automated teaching</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Teaching in Higher Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cff6062c8e32f114958d23990e3718a5"><gtr:id>cff6062c8e32f114958d23990e3718a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bayne S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/15CA9C5D-6EC5-4D54-9F6D-2DC2D002DC55"><gtr:id>15CA9C5D-6EC5-4D54-9F6D-2DC2D002DC55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Governing Knowledge: Comparison, Knowledge-based Technologies and Expertise in the Regulation of Education</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01"><gtr:id>950c1a62c23efa958f4a063b4b11cf01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fenwick T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0E3B42B0-F4B4-4D2E-954D-DD7D9336BFC5"><gtr:id>0E3B42B0-F4B4-4D2E-954D-DD7D9336BFC5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coding the biodigital child: the biopolitics and pedagogic strategies of educational data science</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Pedagogy, Culture &amp;
