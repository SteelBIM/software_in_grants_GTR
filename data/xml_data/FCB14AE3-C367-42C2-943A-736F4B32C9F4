Peri-urban areas, at the interface between urban and rural, link rural livelihoods with the urban lifestyles that put multiple pressures on peri-urban ecosystems. This poses huge challenges for the health and livelihoods of an increasing number of disenfranchised, poor and marginalised citizens, and for the sustainable urban development.

Urban policies for provision of essential services such as food and water, draw upon ecosystem services (ES) from the peri-urban zone and from further and further afield. At the same time the export of polluting activities and domestic waste to peri-urban localities degrades ES, with adverse implications for urban and peri-urban communities.

This research project aims to explore the intersections between ES and poverty in peri-urban areas of India, and implications for urban development. Our overarching research hypothesis is that a better understanding of peri-urban ES and relationships with poverty alleviation will generate knowledge and mobilize people, and in turn generate more effective urban development initiatives. These will build much needed synergies between urban and peri-urban communities to support poverty alleviation goals.

To better understand the complex interactions of ES and human well-being in highly dynamic peri-urban landscapes, we will use spatio-temporal modelling to analyse interactions and trade-offs. This will involve a combination of primary and secondary data and the development of new approaches to modelling that could be used to support initiatives to enhance ES benefits and support urban planning processes.

Empirical detailed case studies will be carried out in Delhi's National Capital Territory. We will work with peri-urban communities to examine the relationship between ES (emphasis on primary data collection for ES associated with agriculture and food systems) and multiple dimensions of poverty (emphasis on health). We use this new knowledge to identify specific, local, technical and institutional interventions with affected communities, that will help to sustain ES and the livelihoods that they support. We will also identify policy entry points, working with diverse stakeholders to examine the potential to integrate an understanding of the interaction between peri-urban ES and poverty alleviation goals into decision making processes and implementation. Target policies and programmes will include those associated with the national urban horticulture initiative, which aims to support peri-urban producers and ensure a supply of fresh produce to cities, and urban waste management and pollution control plans. The spatial analyses will form the basis of tools to support dialogue with policy actors.

For comparison, parts of peri-urban areas around five additional cities (Hyderabad, Bangalore, Varanasi, Kathmandu and Dhaka) will be mapped at coarser resolution and a subset of ES, selected based on their importance identified in the detailed case studies, will be modelled using tools developed for Delhi. Using data from 5 cities and Delhi we will explore the use of time-series, space-for-time substitution and scenarios to explore the use of narratives and quantitative models of the likely impacts of current (and future) policies on ES and dependent livelihoods.

We will also actively engage with initiatives in other south Asian cities, building a network with partners from other Indian cities and in Nepal and Bangladesh through project-linked activities. This network will facilitate the joint development of research approaches and tools for policy engagement that can be applied more widely.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our vision is of a world in which diverse peri-urban residents recognise the value of ecosystem services (ES), are able to identify potentially destructive pathways which erode these ES and work with stakeholders (e.g. civil society organisations, policy makers and regulators) to develop constructive pathways that protect ES and help lift people out of poverty.

Our project involves impact activities at three interacting levels: 1) peri-urban communities in the vicinity of Delhi, 2) building on our Delhi case study, national policies of direct relevance to other Indian cities, and 3) a south Asia regional network. In each case we draw on established contacts and extensive experience within the research team.

We aim to provide an evidence base and analytical tools that will support greater coherence across the policy streams of environment, health, agriculture and development, to achieve poverty alleviation and urban development goals while the long term sustainability of ES is maximised. Our focus is on building epistemic communities and ES-conscious policy makers, rather than directly tackling vested political and economic interests. The overall goal is, nonetheless, that these activities continue after the research funding ceases, with community representatives, researchers and intermediary organisations skilled and knowledgeable enough to engage in on-going impact initiatives.

Our primary target beneficiaries are poor communities dependent on peri-urban ES, whilst secondary beneficiaries include local political actors, national and regional policy makers, government service providers (e.g. water, agriculture) and health/environment NGOs. Our theory of change, to be developed at the inaugural workshop, starts with the assumption that excellent science needs to address local concerns, engage the most affected people and translate these concerns into policy relevant findings, linking science, practice and policy.

We will engage with peri-urban communities and stakeholders (government officials, policy makers, NGO workers, environmental activists) from the onset. We will utilise participatory approaches throughout including community participatory mapping and impact pathways analysis, in conjunction with a programme of community meetings, workshops, training sessions and policy dialogues. We will engage in dialogue with stakeholders using the maps of ES flows from our spatial analyses, using these visual tools as a way of engaging in discussions about different strategies and policies for peri-urban ES and livelihoods. In addition to identifying specific local interventions to protect ES with the communities involved in Delhi, we will explore specific entry points and processes for local and national policy interventions. In order to do so, the project will build on different partners' existing relationships and engagements with key policy processes (e.g. IWMI engages with policy makers on urban agriculture, water and urban resource reuse and recycling).

Finally, we will establish a regional south Asia group on peri-urban ES to support development of ES/PA methodologies, identify opportunities to raise awareness of ES and poverty alleviation interactions in city policies and plans for resource management. The group will include representatives from each of the cities participating in peri-urban ES mapping activities (Delhi, Varanasi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Dhaka and Khamandu) and from other relevant national and regional groups including WHO and FAO.

Our range of communication material will include details on the participatory mapping of ES and their values, spatial charts of processes, project newsletters, blogs, as well as academic seminars, conference papers, and peer-reviewed journal articles. A project website will provide a collection of new material, including documents, photos, accounts of caf&amp;eacute; scientific and other meetings, and a central space for on-going discussion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>306680</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What does the future hold for Delhi's urban?farmers?

The aim was to sensitise as well as actively engage with the planners who are currently revising the Master plans. We have suggested the ecosystem services concepts that can be used for developing plans looking into the following:
- Areas which are currently supplying high levels of ecosystem services that must be retained for both present and future use;
- Areas which have the potential to supply high levels of ecosystem services and must be rehabilitated or managed to meet the current demand for these services;
- Areas which are not supplying high levels of services and could be used for alternative purposes.
Planners explained that external lobbying was needed to change the approach of municipal governments as well as engagement with development of Master Plans (involving the external consultants who develop the plans). These meetings have highlighted important future pathways to impact which will be followed up through the regional policy group and in other city-level engagements.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder meeting - Nepal</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5F71863-40D3-4A51-97F7-3BDD00F4169A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Team member Ambika Khadka in collaboration with our consultant National Water Conservation Foundation (NWCF) organized the workshop to share the primary outputs of ecosystem services assessment of Nepal.

The participants were encouraged to discuss the various aspects of their agricultural livelihoods (related to spinach and buffalo rearing) through the exercise of creating a physical map by placing objects and marks onto a map of the village.

In addition further photo mapping exercises were conducted in which investigators accompanied individuals throughout the day as they worked in their fields and asked them questions based on a specifically developed questionnaire while taking photos. This was termed 'Photo Mapping'.

The participatory work of generating this data helped foster greater mutual understanding among community members and researchers of the key issues of concern to different groups. The participatory mapping also provided a forum for local community members to discuss and raise awareness of local pollution, health and livelihood issues which guided the direction of the research.

The photos and findings will also be shared with those who took part and the wider local community to help the reflect on their environment and livelihoods.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Short video interviews with Ritu Priya and Ramila Bisht recorded at STEPS Resource Politics 2015 conference for upload to interactions.eldis.org</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A449E0D-57D6-4AEC-91AE-49DB4D6302F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sharing insights from our project with policy makers, activists and researches.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://interactions.eldis.org/urbanisation-and-health</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy Dialogue with national level officials</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C6FE69B-0CCA-4A7D-862E-296E080BE3A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Team member Priyanie Amerasinghe had discsusions with Member Secretary Biodiversity Board, Principal Secretary, Agriculture and Horticulture and Director Ground Water Board.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The pathways to impact for this project targeted multiple levels: leading to outputs for increased awareness amongst peri-urban communities; to opportunity for influencing particular policy processes; through to regional dialogues on the importance of integrating peri-urban environment and health considerations into city region planning. These activities have been embedded into each phase of research, beginning with the development of our theory of change at the projects inception workshop, and revisiting this as the project has evolved. 
Throughout the fieldwork with the local communities in Karhera and Yamuna, a diverse range of local stakeholders were engaged in shaping the research to directly address their concerns. Participatory mapping activities and community meetings have helped to promote a better understanding among the communities themselves of the issues emerging from the research. Contact with the Karhera community in particular has been maintained and this ongoing two way exchange of knowledge between communities and researchers opens up the potential for immediate and tangible impact from the research in terms of mobilising and equipping communities to raise awareness of important local issues.
In Karhera, there is strong sense of disempowerment within the community makes it difficult to move from enhanced knowledge to immediate change in practices or other action. The particular characteristics of the peri-urban can lead to low social capital and other factors that further disempower the poor. However it is expected that impact beyond the project will help to address this. We are linking with local NGOs (such as the Bhoomi foundation) and potentially wider civil society groups to support communities to monitor environmental change and engage with policy makers and officials to seek action on local issues. Beyond Karhera, in the other case study cities, focus groups (Hyderabad and Bangalore) and participatory mapping (Hyderabad, Bangalore and Varanasi) with local stakeholders led to similar exchanges of knowledge and enhanced both the relevance of the research to local issues as well as increasing the local public engagement with those issues. This laid the foundation for an ongoing relationship with local groups which will be brought together in the final stages of the project impact activities to help shape policy influence and mobilise communities. 
In a similar way, engagement with policy makers was undertaken from the start of the project with the aim of building ongoing relationships that could help inform the research and provide future channels for policy influence in the long term. Discussions with policy makers and interested departments in regional group and at National level in India and Nepal and with municipal level officials in Hyderabad and Delhi have led to changes in views on behalf of policymakers and to plans for future engagement and opportunities for future policy influence.
In addition to the local community impacts and policy related impacts the project has been successful in developing the skills base at JNU, IWMI and the NGO ToxicLinks in interdisciplinary research. We have initiated new disciplinary and sectoral partnerships and involve students, early career researchers and third sector activists in research design, data collection and analysis and in contributing to conference papers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0FDF5278-C740-474F-AFA5-CA92D6A5E6E0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Inputs to DFID HEART Helpdesk Report on Urbanisation, Health and Nutrition of the Poor</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>70130C5F-AA3D-49C3-AE6F-04503BC0FE25</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in DFID CRISSA Regional Consultation (7th - 8th April 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DE45AFB-1B3A-4888-9EB0-F6FAE0923674</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/164246005</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Briefing note for National Urban Livelihoods Mission, India.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B3FC3B4-5A6B-4116-B1DE-636EA900BF4E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Formal response to the draft Indian National Health Policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D6058D6E-F318-4692-AD8B-0B571BE3E064</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Transcripts of interviews with policy stakeholders in Delhi.
