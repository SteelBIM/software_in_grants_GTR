(a) Attempting to plug the gaps in our knowledge of human induced climate change by uncovering historical records that help us understand climate and environmental change in the last 400 years. European intellectual engagement with the environments of empire over four centuries produced a corpus of documentary sources on the environment. The use of colonies for environmental experimentation resulted in locations in South Asia, Southern Africa, Australia and islands such as Mauritius becoming open-air laboratories for scientists attempting to understand, investigate, and manipulate a world of new peoples, species, environments and diseases. These sources have rarely been examined for the information they contain on environmental and climate change.
(b) By redressing the information imbalance in the Global South by creating a group that would bring together data and approaches in the area of climate change and environmental history with groups and researchers concerned with understanding change in the environments on the peripheries of the Indian Ocean.
The network will do this by: 
1. Bringing together an interdisciplinary community of researchers from the humanities, social sciences and the natural sciences to debate and conceptualise a database project on plant sciences and climate science of the IOW as documented in the records of the period. Sciences such as historical meteorology, phenology (a study of which species of plants and animals were living in which locations during which period) palynology (study of how much of the pollen of which flowering plants has been preserved in various places like lake sediments) depend on both historical documentary evidence and on physical evidence.
2. Discussing how to combine physical evidence of environmental change, with historical documentary evidence such as colonial records, documentary evidence of indigenous knowledge systems, and practices of natural resource use. 

The locations for which we intend to gather and aggregate data are China, Mauritius, East Africa, the Cape, Sri Lanka, Western Australia, South East Asia and India. The region under study is the Indian Ocean World (IOW): an area of primary geo-political importance whose foundations are related to the monsoons, a system of winds and currents unique to the Indian Ocean, Indonesia and South and East China seas. The influence of the monsoon on the land and communities of the Indian Ocean and the inter-connected bodies of water helped to generate long distance trade and and led to an exchange of ideas, commodities and peoples. The intensive maritime voyaging of European mercantile empires after 1500 led to further interactions between indigenous knowledge systems and European ideas resulting in the distinctive environment, society, economy and culture of IOW of the modern period. 

CWEH is uniquely positioned to do this as a leading centre in the UK working on the environmental history of the tropics and as a result of its links with other networks such as ACRE and Historic Weather concerned with transcribing, digitising and publishing online various sorts of meteorological data for the period 1700-2000. Our expertise in the tropics has been further established as a result of our collaborative work with Kew and the Natural History Museum (NHM) on specific Indian records relating to natural history and our participation in an AHRC-sponsored meeting in Bangalore in March 2011 on South Asian historical records and climate change which led to another meeting on 'Botany Climate and Empire' in Sussex in May 2011 involving the MET office, Kew Gardens, the British Library and the Natural History Museum.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The key beneficiaries of the research outside the research community include: librarian and archivists, museum specialists, policy makers in government institutions in the Indian Ocean World and the UK government.

Several librarians and archivists will be involved in the network, including the head of the National Archives of India, the archivists responsible for the India Office collections at the British Library and the Nehru Memorial Library in Delhi, the collections at Kew, the Natural History Museum, at the heads of institutions, such as, the Kolkata Botanic Garden, and the National Museum of Natural History, Delhi. These holding institutions will benefit from the interaction with scholars that this network will provide, firstly in terms of understanding which of their own collections are of interest to scholars of meteorological and botanical history and secondly in becoming aware of one another's holdings and how they might complement one another. 

Given the importance of the issue of climatic and environmental change, the data that is generated in the network project will also be important for policy makers, who will benefit from a long-term perspective on climate change and the responses to it from the colonial period onwards.Through the involvement of the MET office in the UK and its counterpart in Pune, we will ensure that the findings of the network reach government institutions in the UK and India, and influence policy concerning climate change research and policy. Both the National Archives of India, and the British Library have strong links with the Indian Ministry of Culture while the National Museum of Natural History comes under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, and thus the findings of the network will also be fed into Indian government policy. The UK Department of Business, Innovation and Skills will benefit from the promotion of UK expertise in how to use historical records to understand climate change as part of its endeavour to promote research partnerships between centres of excellence and towards developing professional and technical skills in education and training which meets the needs on an environmental scholarship for the 21st century. 

The discussions during the networking project will include how to involve the wider public in research on an issue that affects every member of global civil society. Through the involvement of museums and libraries, the findings of the network will be transmitted to researchers outside the network and to the general public. It is envisaged that at a future date, academic members of the network will assist with displays and events to make the research visible to these audiences. Members of the Centre for World Environmental History are currently involved in existing projects to digitise and make use of the botanical records of Nathaniel Wallich and Joseph Dalton Hooker. As part of these projects we have taken part in public conferences and meetings and aided with the design of displays. These include helping to organise a public meeting on Nathanial Wallich and Indian natural history 6th and 7th December and a major public conference and museum display on Joseph Hooker at Kew Garden on the 9 December. 

The overall impact of the network will be an increase both academic and non-academic collaboration around a critical issue, between the UK, Commonwealth partners in the Indian Ocean, and China. The potential impacts are environmental - in terms of the potential benefits for our understanding of human interaction with nature over the longue dur&amp;eacute;e; cultural - in terms of the potential for exchange and personnel between countries; technological - in terms of the planned road map for large-scale digitisation; and have the potential to influence public policy, particularly in the UK and India.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34699</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The result of our collaborations with Kew has resulted in the development of co-produced project on Hooker and India which is now hosted on the Kew website

The value of these both in terms of preserving the natural heritage of these countries in the Indian Ocean world and in knowledge creation and knowledge repatriation cannot be underestimated.

As a result there has been a resurgence of interest in inventorying and showcasing these collections among a range of institutions from NHM, to Kew to the BL and Indian institutions such as the National Museum of natural History, The Forest Research Institute, The Botanical Survey of India, The Indian Museum. We are planning to bring the Hooker exhibition to India next year as part of the larger engagement process with the wider public in India.

The network built up as a result of the AHRC network grant has 105 members. These include librarians and archivists in holding institutions such as the British Library, Kew Gardens, the Natural History Museum in the U.K, Indian institutions such as the Botanical Survey of India (BSI) in Kolkata, the Indian Museum in Kolkata and the Natonal Archives in Delhi and academics from a range of universities from Malaysia, India, U.K. and Australia. The network had three meetings in U.K. and India and several steering committee and technical committee meetings. These were very successful meetings, attended by 50 scholars and archivists each, as a scoping exercise of archival collections and a discussion of the relevance of these to the problems of environmental and climate change in the Indian Ocean region. There were also detailed discussions and presentations of papers by members of the technical committee on the development of an interpretative framework for the records through a discussion of capture, presentation and metadata of the sources. The discussions on the technical and intellectual infrastructure for an interactive online database for these digitised collections have been invaluable in taking these ideas forward for holding institutions such as libraries and archives within the network. All the detailed discussions and the workshop minutes are available via URL http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean. More recently CWEH and the AHRC network are listed in the INDARE (Indian Ocean Data Rescue) implementation plan that was signed by several countries of the Indian Ocean Rim at a senior government level to preserve the climate heritage of the Indian Ocean. http://www.gfcs-climate.org/node/1

As a result of these meetings the Botanical Survey of India, the Indian Museum and the Forest Research Institute, Dehradhun are attempting to conserve and digitise their vast holdings for example on meteorological data and historic botanical collections. In the Botanical Survey of India, Kolkata, this exercise has resulted in the rescue and digitisation of the 33 Volumes of Nathanial Wallich's manuscript files and some of his herbarium specimens from the 1820s. Along with the transcription of Joseph Hooker's India letters 1848-52 which also emerged as a result of the ongoing discussions between CWEH and Kew Gardens further facilitated by the award, these resources provide an invaluable source for the environmental history of India. These letters are hosted on the Kew website. http://www.kew.org. As a result of the successful meetings of the network, a memorandum of understanding has also been signed between the University of Sussex, the British Library and the U.K Met office to share historic weather and climate data to enhance understanding of environmental and climate change in the Indian Ocean World. There is also a further proposal being currently discussed with the British Library to have a display of holdings relating to indigenous sources on Indian environmental history at the BL such as manuscripts from the endangered collections in the Sundarbans region of Bengal and a further proposal, in discussion with Kew Gardens, the Botanical Survey of India and the Indian Museum to bring the Hooker exhibition to the Indian Museum in Kolkata in 2017 the year of Hooker's bi-centenary.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E02A746E-2B85-4E2C-BC39-E2D69273F812</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The AHRC networking grant on the botanical and meteorological history of the Indian Ocean has helped to create a network of 105 members which includes holding institutions such as libraries and archives and academics from a number of countries in India and the Indian ocean world with an aim to enhance the use of historical records to understand environmental and climate change in the period 1600-1900. This is a hugely important period as European empires, the British, Dutch, French and Portuguese brought about an unprecedented transformation of the landscapes and environments on the periphery of the Indian Ocean. They also closely documented the impact of European colonisation on flora and fauna and on the natural world in general by keeping meticulous records in botany, zoology, meteorology and other branches of the natural sciences. These are now proving invaluable for understanding long term climate and environmental change in a global context. The network aimed to address the sense of global concern associated with the threat of anthropogenic climate change by attempting to plug gaps in our knowledge of human induced climate change by (a)uncovering historical records that help us understand climate and environmental change in the last 400 years and (b) by redressing the information balance in the Global South by creating a group that would bring together data and approaches in the arena of climate change and environmental history with groups and researchers concerned with understanding change in the environments on the periphery of the Indian ocean. 

We were successful in both these aims having brought together a very active team of holding institutions and scholars in an interdisciplinary context to debate and conceptualise a database project on plant sciences and climate science of the IOW world as documented in the records of the period. This included detailed discussions of how to combine physical evidence of environmental change with historical documentary evidence such as colonial records, documentary evidence of indigenous knowledge systems and practices of natural resource use. In terms of knowledge exchange we were particularly successful having got together the Botanical Survey of India, Kolkata, The Forest Research Institute, Dehradun, the Indian Museum Kolkata, the British Library, The U.K. Met office, the Natural History Museum and Kew Gardens in a collaborative exercise also aimed to redress the information balance in the global south in the area of botanical and climate history. For the Botanical Survey of India this has resulted in a further collaborative exercise with Kew for the creation of a database of Indian plant types held in major British herbaria. The Centre for Environmental History, (CWEH) is hoping to be the chief liaison institution in this process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Centre for World Environmental History (CWEH) which I am the director of is a leading centre in the U.K. working on the environmental history of the tropics. The AHRC funding has further helped the Centre to establish its position as a liaison between various holding institution and archives and various scholars from the Indian Ocean world on scoping and digistising historical records related to environmental and climate change. As a result of the activities of the network, holding institutions such as the BL, The NHM, Kew Gardens, The Botanical Survey of India, The Forest Research Institute, The National Archives India, The Indian Museum have benefited from interaction with scholars, firstly in terms of understanding which of their collections are of interest to scholars of meteorological and botanical history and secondly in terms of becoming aware of one another's holdings and how they might complement one another. This has led for example in the Global South in a successful attempt by the Botanical survey of India to preserve and digitise its colonial manuscript collections on Indian botany and to put together a further proposal with Kew Gardens for creating a database of Indian plant types held in major British herbaria. This is critical to the creation of a new Flora of India project. Through our links with the BL and Met office we are raising awareness of the records as a source for climate studies. Some of the hard data we have uncovered could contribute to data modelling exercises being undertaken by the Met office. A further small Canadian Research council grant via the University of Mcgill to CWEH for a climate modelling exercise has been enabled by this AHRC grant. More recently in 2016 we have been awarded a Norwegian grant to work on climate change, uncertainity and social transformation and are working on historical climate date in two fragile environments, the Sundarbans and Kutch.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AE9622A7-9AEF-4DE3-971E-4F9FB61EB286</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/cweh/research/indianocean</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on policy of Indian institutions such as the Botanical Survey of India by helping to create an inventory of their manuscript holdings on natural history.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>87C33B63-A178-4D17-B0EC-1D2E8342B5B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The rescuing of India's climate and environmental data will help improve understandings of climate change and environmental sustainability in the long term.
