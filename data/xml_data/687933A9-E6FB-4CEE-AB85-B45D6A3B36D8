A partner could be a museum or a cultural organisation, a freelance artist, a voluntary or advocacy group?the programme seeks to be definitionally open. Connected Communities aims to be both interdisciplinary (hence the fact that although led by AHRC, its award holders are also funded by other research councils such as Economic and Social Research Council), and at the same time to have a core arts and humanities presence. The academic leadership of the programme is given by two Leadership Fellows, each appointed for three years from 2012. The purpose of this grant application is to renew the Leadership Fellowship of Prof George McKay for a further three years, 2015-2018. It includes an administrator, two postdoctoral researchers, and key activities include working with academics and community partners on their funded projects, liaising with the AHRC and other funding bodies, a new set of activities and events collaborating with the Leadership Fellows for other AHRC themes (Care for the Future, Digital Transformations, Translating Cultures, and Science in Culture), as well as undertaking personal research work related to the programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>626992</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cheltenham Festivals</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Organiser on Researching (Jazz) Festivals: A Day of Ideas and Discussion, Cheltenham Jazz Festival</gtr:description><gtr:id>08B4EA7C-4462-4BAC-8ED8-B38F59FDF6B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of an on-going relationship with a small number of festival organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Cheltenham Jazz Festival helped to organise the Day of Ideas and Discussion as part of their 2016 Festival Programme.

This Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded network is a joint initiative between the Translating Cultures theme and the Connected Communities programme, and is open to researchers and partners funded under those areas, as well as to the wider academic and music communities.The network's programme of activities explores the neglected important popular music, political, religious culture of reggae.

The purpose of this first symposium was to begin scoping the field of research and public engagement activity so we could see where work on reggae is already being undertaken and also to begin to think about research gaps. The Symposium was attended by 40 people, with a range of speakers, both based in the UK and internationally, who talked about and presented their work on areas including:

?Current and recent funded research projects on reggae and related areas
?PhD students introducing their reggae-related research topics
?Wider public knowledge activity on reggae, including exhibitions
?Academic researchers presenting their own work in the field.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.reggaenetwork.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Kendal Calling festival, co-curator and chair of public discussion panel, Festivals Britannia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E0E1A61-5E97-48D5-BD23-B8EB956B92F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-curated content and haired panel discussion with researchers and industry speakers in a tent at this pop festival, which attracted a large audience, some in passing through, some for 1-2 hours.

This year long programme encompassed a range of events, from regional events in local communities to large international conferences bringing together researchers from the arts and humanities (and other disciplines where appropriate), research organisations, community groups, creative practitioners and other community partners.

Our largest scale Utopias event was the Connected Communities Festival exploring Community Futures and Utopias which saw local activities taking place across the country between March and July. The Festival was undertaken in partnership with The Somerset House Trust as a part of Utopia 2016: a year of Imagination and Possibility - four seasons of events, exhibitions and new commissions celebrating the idea of Utopia to mark the 500th anniversary of Thomas More's influential text. Utopia 2016 was a partnership between the Somerset House Trust and its neighbours King's College London and the Courtauld Institute and Gallery.

The 2016 Festival supported high quality participatory arts research and research co-production activities across the UK on the theme of community futures and utopias and provided an opportunity to explore creative ways to build upon, and widen and deepen community engagement with, research being undertaken by the Connected Communities Programme and with wider AHRC/RCUK-funded research</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.utopia500.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In the context of a key leadership role for one of RCUK's cross-council and multidisciplinary programmes, Connected Communities is having tremendous impact by virtue of its over 300 awards, working in collaboration with over 500 community partners.
