The key note was the third Barbara Burford Memorial Lecture (http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/may/26/barbara-burford-obituary). The abstract of the paper is below: 
Long standing political struggles mean it is no longer possible to dismiss sickle cell and thalassemia as marginal health concerns that only affect ethnic minority populations. Nonetheless, inequalities remain. Coordinated ante-natal and neo-natal screening is raising important questions about what is meant by informed choice, while essenitalised ideas of ethnic and cultural differences continue to generate barriers to care. In addition, service provision for those with the condition, despite examples of excellent practice, remains under-resourced and poorly coordinated. This presentation will assess the current evidence, by outlining the potential for inequality in current policy and practice, before offering a foundation on which to base future strategies for facilitating equality. In doing so, the presentation will provide an overview of current screening policy for so called 'at-risk' communities and connect these to current assumptions informing health and social care for those with the condition. It will conclude by outlining an agenda for change.

Twenty-five people attended from a range of different backgrounds, including academic members of staff, post-graduate students, NHS practitioners, health care managers and service users. The presentation was broad in scope and using research evidence, identified some of the political, social and ethical tensions informing the historical and current provision of screening and care services for sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders. Part of the presentation reflected on some of the issues informing our current ESRC funded project, Living With Sickle Cell Or Beta Thalassaemia Trait: Implications For Identity And Social Life. These included how people make sense of being a carrier of sickle cell or thalassaemia trait and the specific implications of this for how they perceive its impact on their ideas of health. The workshop also presented an ideal opportunity to publicise the project; identify potential statutory and community partners; and generate our sample.

Karl Atkin and Simon Dyson, using contacts emerging from their current research project, facilitated a day-long meeting in Leicester, to establish whether closer joint working would be welcome by community organisations. To help focus the discussion, three speakers were invited (representing Roald Dahl Marvellous Children's Charity. Age UK and MIND) to share their experience of working in the third sector. These presentations informed the basis of wider discussion among the participants. The day, although challenging, was a success and various action points were agreed, including a further meeting in March 2014, to discuss joint vision and strategy, along with identifying possible joint projects, on which the various organisations can work together.

In the UK, currently there are 240,000 sickle cell carriers (predominantly people of African and African-Caribbean origins origins) and 214,000 carriers of thalassaemia trait (largely people of Greek, Turkish, Cypriot, and South and Asian origins). Even though carriers do not develop the condition, we know little about how the diagnosis impacts on their ideas about health, illness and social identity on one hand and state governed technologies of 'reproductive choice' on the other. It will be argued that clinically a genetic trait exists 'betwixt and between' (Turner, 1967) the medical and the social; constituting a carrier of SCDs and thalassaemias as neither (not) healthy nor sick (Tapper, 1991, Fullwiley, 2010). Further, individual moral engagements with the notion of genetic risk reflect biographical locations and family history as well as wider political responses to these two conditions as minority health issues- both shaping and resisting state policies of governance aimed at prevention and control.

INTRODUCTION
The social and policy impact of our research has been maximised using our long standing partnerships with our national and local voluntary sector collaborators (Sickle Cell Society (SD is a scientific advisor), UK Thalassaemia Society, Oscar Sandwell, SSCAT Sheffield, Oscar Birmingham, Manchester) as well as links with the National Screening Programme (KA is an Advisory Board member; KA chaired Public Outreach and advises on national audit of new-born outcomes). We have used different pathways to engage with three main groups of stakeholders who have benefited from the research process as well as the findings: the NHS Screening Programme; health and social care professionals within the NHS and voluntary sector organisations; and carriers, patients, family and community members potentially affected by or caring for someone with sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders. The main focus of our impact plan has been to facilitate a dialogue across these three groups, without the naivety of assuming that power is shared equally among these three constituencies.

2. ENGAGING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
I. We have engaged with the Outreach Office of the National (NHS) Screening Programme right from the inception of the project. We invited representatives to our Research Advisory Board meetings to ensure that they had a close engagement with the research process and the emerging findings. This link provided additional opportunities for:
? Facilitating an input into the new suite of eight information leaflets for adult carriers published by the Screening Programme. (sct.screening.nhs.uk/publications). These leaflets were piloted (before publication) at the four regional professional workshops conducted by the research team. The research team also advised on the text to ensure it appropriately captured the experience of service users. 
? Providing advice to the Outreach Office on the format and social content of the proposed GCSE Science lessons, using sickle cell and thalassaemia as models to demonstrate inheritance. The lessons, developed in collaboration with the Sheffield Hallam University, used vignettes, aiming to widen the students' understanding of genetic disorders and carrier screening, highlighting probable ethical and cultural issues raised by screening. 
? Inviting the Director of the Programme, Dr Anne Mackie, to the London community dissemination event, at Friends House, in July 2014, to encourage wider public engagement with the salient issues related to information, screening and support raised by the research in addition to those highlighted by the participants on the day (including a thalassaemia patient, a sickle cell carrier and a mother who has cared for a son with thalassaemia who provided biographical accounts). 
? Following on from the London event and the written Summary of Findings (www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/beta-thalass/), the Outreach Office have confirmed that a review of the carrier leaflets will be a 2016-1017 objective; and that the NSC will also consider the value gained (or lost) from knowing carrier status of inherited autosomal recessive disorders (email communication: 08/06/15). 

II. Professionals within the NHS and voluntary sector organisations have used the findings from the research for educational/awareness purposes to:
? gain a better understanding of the shared experiences of carriers in relation to genetic risk across ethnic groups; using this knowledge to challenge their own perceptions of ethnicity, minority ethnic groups and how individuals make reproductive choices; and 
? analyse why patients and carriers might behave in seemingly 'irrational' ways or engage in seemingly 'risky' behaviour; and think outside the box of the 'deficit model of science' focusing on the different meanings of and biographical contexts within which genetic risk is revealed as a process, rather than an one-off event.

Our connections with professionals and voluntary sector organisations have been further facilitated by invited presentations at various events, organised by these key stakeholders. This was to ensure the widest possible dissemination of the study findings, facilitate community engagement and encourage informed discussion about the role of genetic screening and the use of reproductive technologies in our society. Audiences included carriers, patents, community members, local politicians, health and social care professionals, managers and policy makers. For example, we were invited to several educational/annual awareness meetings to discuss the findings: 9th Annual Health Conference, Sheffield Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia (SSCAT) (KA &amp;amp; SC): Research and Audit Seminar, Manchester NHS Trust (SC); UK Thalassemia Society, Bradford/Leeds area meeting (SC); North of England Bone Marrow and Thalassaemia Association (NEBATA) (SD); Annual Awareness Conference, Manchester (SC); Sickle Cell Society, AGM, London (SC and SD) who hosted a seminar 'on being a sickle cell carrier' for 75 participants (representing carriers, patients, family and community members as well as clinicians) in London (SC, SD).

III. Connecting with carriers, patients with sickle cell and thalassaemia, family and community members by: 
? tapping into a shared pool of understanding and experience across ethnic groups and the two conditions and seeking appropriate information and support; 
? engaging with debates that address issues of disadvantage, disablism and discrimination within their own ethnic community as well as the wider society; and
? challenging the wider racialised attitudes held by some professionals that treat sickle cell and thalassaemia as specific attributes of 'immigrant' ethnic groups and their 'cultures' 

In addition to research participants (professionals and carriers), patients, parents, carers and community members were also invited to both our community dissemination events, jointly hosted with our voluntary sector partners at the end of the project in July 2014 (London and West Bromwich, respectively). Both events were positively evaluated and by bringing voluntary, service and user stakeholders together, generated critical discussion on how best to develop service provision and community support in the current climate of austerity and severe reductions in funding, for voluntary sector organisations providing crucial support to the minority ethnic communities disproportionately affected by these disorders in the UK. 

Following on from our research aims and in response to the hostile environment in which our voluntary sector partners feel they have to operate, the team have supported the voluntary sector partners by sharing research expertise in building their research capacity. For example, KA and SD facilitated three national meetings involving eight NGOs (Sickle Cell Society, UK Thalassaemia Society, OSCAR Sandwell, OSCAR Birmingham, OSCAR Nottingham, OSCAR Leicester, Wolverhampton Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Support Group, Sickle Cell Young Stroke Survivors) seeking:
? to facilitate access to other larger/broader based NGOs (e.g. Age UK, MIND, Roald Dahl Charity) with whom they might collaborate and share research knowledge and resources; 
? to enable joint applications between the groups for funding, and 
? to enable collaborations around sharing research evidence in support of making the case for sickle cell/thalassaemia services to commissioners in a changing landscape for health, social and welfare services.

As part of our wider commitment to supporting the voluntary sector organisations and the local communities they serve, KA and SC attended various meetings between SSCAT (Sheffield) and the NHS Local Commissioners to ensure proposed changes to the NHS funding do not have a detrimental impact on service users. Similar support has been provided to Leeds and Cardiff community organisations, along with concerned NHS providers, who feel their current provision is under threat. 

Finally, the team have looked to broaden the impact of the project by giving presentations in other community settings and supporting public engagement with genetics and ethical debates generated by the use of new reproductive technologies, such as, talks to North Yorkshire Humanists, participation in Pint of Science Event and a planned presentation to the University of the Third Age. 

3. CHALLENGES
One of the main challenges of achieving the impact plan has been to deal with certain politically and culturally sensitive issues emerging from and around our research. For example, the potentially conflicting response of local community members and healthcare professionals about the high incidence of consanguineous marriages amongst Muslims of South Asian origin was particularly salient at the Bradford UKTS regional awareness event. Following a standard presentation in English, SC was asked to discuss the findings in Urdu for a diverse multi-generational audience that was palpably uncomfortable at the mention of 'marrying within the biraderi' (endogamous kinship group/ consanguineous marriages). The other contentious issue was the potential policy response to the inadvertent diagnosis of sickle cell carriers through newborn screening and whether or not parents should be informed of such results (cf. the recent change in policy to non- disclosure of such results in Wales). As a research team, we had to respect the often conflicting perspectives of different stakeholders. We have, in fact, seen the negotiation of these as fundamental part of our community and policy engagement; and key to ensuring that informed debates about screening take place in an inclusive manner where the voices of people from minority ethnic and socio-economically marginalised backgrounds are heard as being equally valid.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>57DA1975-C871-404F-A135-6F2B3A0F2841</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study offers an in-depth understanding of how individuals make sense of carrying a trait for sickle cell and thalassaemia (potentially serious, inherited blood disorders), within the context of their broader family and social relationships. An important focus of our research is to link changes in health policy (such as, newborn and antenatal screening) to individual experience and shifting cultural values related to 'genetic risk' and the use of new reproductive technologies. We bridge these two worlds, using the concepts and methods from social sciences. The following issues are highlighted through our findings:

? A trait (for a recessive gene) can remain invisible in families for generations. Hence, despite the higher incidence in particular ethnic groups, individuals/families might have little or no experiential knowledge about sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders. 
? In the language of healthcare professionals and educational materials, genetic risk appears as a fixed, visible attribute of being a carrier. The risk of passing on/inheriting the gene can be easily quantified and once communicated, will not change. In contrast, carriers understand risk as unfolding and changing in meaning over time, within the context of significant relationships, experiential knowledge, professional communication as well as historical and cultural factors. 
? Provision of appropriate counselling for adult carriers remains largely confined to antenatal care for women/couples identified as being 'at risk' for having a baby with these blood disorders. This leaves many anxious carriers to fend for information on their own, with little or no professional support. 
? Voluntary sector organisations provide excellent, easily accessible, personalised support to carriers who might have unaddressed questions triggered by personal circumstances. This support is being threatened by reductions in the NHS funds available to them. 
? The idea of a 'healthy carrier', endorsed by the NHS in the policy and educational literature, is a caricature. It fails to acknowledge and address the potential emotional, physical and social impact of a carrier 'diagnosis'. Some carriers might experience symptoms; be anxious about their baby/child who has been identified as a carrier; or indeed the implications of being a carrier for the health of their children or grandchildren. This finding has particular importance for how policy and practice presents genetic testing.
? Professional perceptions of sickle cell and thalassaemia disorders being an attribute of minority ethnic groups/cultures/heritage (rather than a genetic condition per se) can reinforce stigma for carriers and undermine their confidence in biomedical explanations as well as the credibility of healthcare professionals. 
? A policy focus on 'at risk communities' (rather than individuals) is similarly unhelpful in challenging stigma and promoting reproductive choice. It can inadvertently strengthen misperceptions and stereotypes, such as the association of 'full blown' sickle cell anaemia with AIDS in some people of African origin; or the attribution of thalassaemia to consanguinity in Muslims of South Asian origin. 
? With around 1 in 10 couples in England living in mixed ethnic relationships- and likely to have children with multiple partners over their life-course -parents and (half) siblings within the same family can inherit different traits or complex haemoglobin variants. Identifying ethnicity/ family origin as a marker of 'at risk' individuals will increasingly become less reliable in clinical practice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings can potentially be used by academics, healthcare professionals, policy makers as well as carriers and others affected by these disorders within and outside the UK. 

Several Voluntary sector organisations, including SCS LONDON, UKTS have used our findings for capacity building and strengthening their recent funding applications to the NHS with our support.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>732B7A07-E621-4C17-9047-13A3BFFD8EF4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Review and redesign of 'Screening tests for you and your baby' booklet for the National Screening Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8250D29B-9F9E-478A-BBB8-6F68C8EC7F61</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>It takes two : genetics screening dilemmas to support GCSE science</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2628AED7-1177-410D-8508-532410830C63</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitations/ suggestions from Public/on ways to improve health of Tribal populations in India</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AD006BF-29A4-4ED6-A00C-B677605ACDC9</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Summary of research findings for health and social care professionals</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>77530F01-CFF1-40C6-929B-963D347744E6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.york.ac.uk/healthsciences/research/public-health/projects/beta-thalass/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Living with sickle cell or beta thalassaemia trait : preliminary findings and implications for policy and practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD2556A1-49E8-40D8-8E1C-3E36CBAD67B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We were invited to present the policy and practice implications of the preliminary findings from the project at the Steering Group Meeting of the NHS sickle cell and thalassaemia screening programme, held on 7th November, in London.
