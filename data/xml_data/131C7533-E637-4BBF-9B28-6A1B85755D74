development, impact and business potential of a Virtual Power Plant (VPP) integrating: building energy management;
renewable electricity generation, electric vehicles and battery storage systems. The project will manage the electricity use
of a range of sites, from single properties through to large commercial premises. The proposed management system uses
algorithm based predictive control to enable and optimise the active utilisation of multiple electric vehicle and domestic
storage batteries as an energy storage and generation resource. The project will demonstrate VPP functionality,
aggregating the disparate energy distributed energy resources to provide wider network ancillary support services, such as
peak shaving. This will reduce variability in electricity demand levels, cost and CO2 emissions, plus improve the UK grid
security of supply.
The Warwick university contribution will be a new energy system model that quantifies energy storage, performance and
degradation for a vehicle battery system when exercised under real-world driving and charging/discharging conditions
(Vehicle-to-Grid: V2G). This model will reinforce the capability of the industrial partners in areas of energy system design
and evaluation. A comprehensive understanding of energy storage performance and degradation will also be of great value
to energy providers - it will further support the creation of business models that promote the use of renewable sources of
energy integrated with local storage.
Energy storage is one of the eight great technologies identified by the government to propel the UK to future growth (David
Willetts MP, Policy Exchange, 2013). The RCUK Review of Energy in 2010 highlights that R&amp;amp;D into energy storage has the
potential to yield high levels of de carbonisation beyond 2030. The TSB (Energy Supply Strategy, 2012) states that battery
related R&amp;amp;D within the energy and transport sectors is a UK priority that will benefit from public investment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Consortium Partners
The primary impact from the Warwick contribution will be a new energy system model that quantifies energy storage,
performance and degradation for a vehicle battery system when exercised under real-world driving and
charging/discharging conditions (Vehicle-to-Grid: V2G). This model will reinforce the capability of Potenza Technology for
energy storage system design and the ability of the lead partner Cenex to provide leading guidance and consultancy
service to both private and public electric and hybrid vehicle fleet operators, domestic consumers and energy providers. A
comprehensive understanding of energy storage performance and degradation will be of great value to energy providers - it
will further support the creation of business models that promote the use of renewable sources of energy integrated with
local storage.
Wider UK Supply Chain
Innovations in integrated battery system manufacture and use will spill-over from the transport sector and energy sectors
with impact to other, high-value, industries (e.g. the built environment and air/rail transport). Embedding the researcher
within the High Value Manufacturing (HVM) Catapult and the National Automotive Innovation Campus (NAIC) (see
Pathways to Impact) will ensure broad engagement with a diverse range of stakeholders, including SMEs and technology
start-ups. The proposed research will reduce the commercial risk for energy storage development; opening the market to
new entrants and stimulating innovation. The PI and researcher will exploit their various networks - WMG HVM Catapult,
IIPSI (International Institute for Product and Service Innovation - Warwick), Niche Vehicle Network (Potenza Technology),
Vehicle fleet operators and energy providers (Cenex) to ensure that the research deliverables are disseminated through a
range of means to UK companies and SME's.
Professional Training
The research milestones will feed directly into the syllabus content of professional educational programmes (at Masters
level) on alternative propulsion, energy systems, complex electrical networks, systems modelling and simulation and digital
verification (e.g. the Science Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies Alliance (SEMTA) Advanced Skills Accreditation
Scheme (ASAS) programme). Companies will benefit from staff with improved knowledge and skills, with the potential to
stimulate shorter-term impact in the commissioning, design and manufacture of new energy storage technologies.
Public
The wider public will better appreciate the value and role of engineering and manufacturing science when addressing
international societal challenges. Students at the WMG Academy for Young Engineers will benefit from a structured
programme of learning (focussed on key STEM subjects), based around state-of-the-art facilities and real-world problems.
Information from the project will be disseminated on a WMG website. The website will facilitate a centralised repository for
relevant open source data and open source WMG publications. Research publications and data will also be shared with
Cardiff University for inclusion in their project website for local public engagement.
Social
Reduced domestic energy bills through the adoption plug-in vehicles (through the increased use of Vehicle-2-Grid, V2G).
Greater accessibility of Electric Vehicles within the UK as purchase price falls and OEMs explore integrated service models
of mobility and energy supply (related to improved battery management).
Environmental
The headline environmental benefit through this project is the reduction in CO2 derived from the use of integrated V2G;
where at scale, a 6% average daily balancing contribution to grid services would equate to at least 12 million tonnes of
CO2 saved nationally by 2020.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/34C1EDE7-5360-40BA-AB39-A99C5634793F"><gtr:id>34C1EDE7-5360-40BA-AB39-A99C5634793F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effects of high frequency current ripple on electric vehicle battery performance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Energy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bba13643245247d66f951735a514231c"><gtr:id>bba13643245247d66f951735a514231c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Uddin K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1D3772F1-67F7-44F0-8293-B1BE6F88B25F"><gtr:id>1D3772F1-67F7-44F0-8293-B1BE6F88B25F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of high-frequency-high-current perturbations on film formation at the negative electrode-electrolyte interface</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electrochimica Acta</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bba13643245247d66f951735a514231c"><gtr:id>bba13643245247d66f951735a514231c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Uddin K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M507143/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE7CEC14-3FA2-49BC-89EE-062447C269C1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Efficiency</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>97AD4D1C-4499-4C7E-AF8A-FE9EFE56E306</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy Storage</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
