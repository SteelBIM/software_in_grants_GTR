The timeliness and significance of this question is evidenced by the current and forthcoming centenaries which are the focus of the research. From the recent commemoration of suffrage, revolution and the sinking of the Titanic, to the world-wide events of the First World War, this project places contemporary centenary events in the context of historical celebrations and commemorations in order to interrogate exactly who is now remembering for whom, and how. 

Calls for centennial commemoration and celebration are often met by claims that the time for such activity has passed - particularly as there are no longer any living witnesses - and claims that it is more appropriate to focus on the present and future. Yet, these events continue to have significance for the families and communities involved. As those tasked with caring for the future, museums and heritage sites are at the centre of negotiating these controversial, and very public, issues. This timely, interdisciplinary, cross-sector project works to contextualise, compare and convey the significance of the centenary and to support museums and heritage sites to embed robust ways of negotiating these commemorations.

The proposal will bring together academics, early career researchers, doctoral students, curators, and educators to work in a genuinely interdisciplinary way. The diversity of expertise within the network will facilitate a focus on different cultural conceptions and manifestations of centenary activity. The findings will be of significance for museum and heritage site professionals and educators across the sectors. 

The project will involve four workshops at the University of Birmingham, the University of Sheffield, the Historic Royal Palaces Tower of London, and Cardiff University. These meetings will be structured to promote dialogue, collaboration and progression of the fields. The project steering group will maintain a website and blog throughout its duration to strengthen the exchange of ideas, report back on the workshops, maintain the impetus beyond the life of the initial project, and attract interest more widely from the constituencies of the members. In addition to the website and blog, the steering group will disseminate results via a film, a conference paper, and a co-authored article.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Museum and Heritage Site Professionals:
One aspiration is that the project will feed into and hopefully influence current practice through dissemination within the professional sector. There are many active networks within the field of heritage interpretation and education who would be interested in the results of the research. Museum and heritage site professionals within the Museums Association, the Social History Curators' Group, the Group for Education in Museums, the Historical Association, the International Museum Theatre Alliance, the International Coalition of Historic Site Museums of Conscience, and The International Council of Museums, Committee For Education and Cultural Action will be informed of the outcomes of the network via the website, blog and existing email lists. Increasing awareness, building confidence and providing knowledge exchange about centennial commemorations may play an important contribution within this sector.

2. Policy Makers:
Steering Committee member, Sam Cairns, manages the Cultural Learning Alliance with 8,000 members, drawing together key evidence, expertise and critical mass to influence policy makers in the Department for Education and Department of Culture, Media, and Sport. Given the significant investment of time and public funds into centennial activities, the insights generated by this project may help to highlight and navigate some of the ethical, political and social issues raised by centennial commemoration and/or celebration.

3. Educational programmers:
Findings of the research will be incredibly useful for helping educators (in museums and in formal education outlets) think about and deal with issues of centenary commemoration within education programmes. Such issues are at the heart of questions of identity and community. Centennial celebrations can play an important role in regional, national and transnational cohesion and well-being but they can also prove divisive and contentious. Highlighting divergent expectations and purposes of such celebrations for different groups will be a key element of this project.

The focus of this project is, by its very nature, wide in its temporal scope: it casts its gaze on events from long ago but at the same time there are immediate and continuing opportunities to see the impact of the project on current centenial activity and on work for the immediate and more distant future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22136</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Explorer Manager at Historic Royal Palaces, Alex Drago, worked with schoolteachers Rocky Haines and Phillipa Prince and animators John Harmer and Shelly Wain to create a film on remembrance of the First World War.

This is a time of unprecedented change, pressure and evolution for museums and their continued investment of resources in this area is not assured. The conference directly addressed those contexts, and suggested imaginative responses to them, helping delegates to explore why and how challenging histories maintain their relevance.

The conference programme included keynotes from:

David Anderson, Director General Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales, on 'Avoiding Challenging History'

Samantha Heywood, Director, Museum of World War II, Boston on 'The challenges of challenging history in the 'real' world'

Stephen Bourne, Scholar and Writer, on 'Black Poppies'

David Gunn, Artist/Producer, on 'Museums of Lies and Secrets'

It also included a performance from electro-folk storytellers 'Harp and A Monkey', a performance of 'Graveyard Voices', a number of off-site sessions and tours, two drinks receptions, and a three-course meal at Cardiff Prison. There were a range of high quality papers, panels and workshops, and pportunities to network and exchange in a 'campfire session' and a 'failure cafe'.

The conference was invited to be a part of the Wales Festival of Innovation.

Questions we explored included

* Is it appropriate to re-imagine the role of museums and museum professionals as activists or as civil society mediators?
* How does our understanding of 'impact' in museums (and Universities also) frame what kind of work with challenging history is deemed viable?
* Do museums' current methodologies need re-imagining?
* How are online-only museums free to imagine their work with challenging histories differently?
* Is there a role for gaming, play and mischief-making in work with difficult and sensitive subject matters?
* What is the role of academic research in re-imagining well-known challenging topics?
* How does all of this link into wider discussions about museums' survival in 2016 and beyond?

The conference was sponsored by the Arts and Humanities Research Council World War One Engagement Centre: Voices of War and Peace http://www.voicesofwarandpeace.org/. Debates about Challenging History are currently being framed against the backdrop of this very high profile and ongoing commemoration. A strand of the conference was therefore dedicated to papers that focused on the lessons that can be learned from dealing with this topic, including the ways in which it informs, challenges or intersects with other histories.

Conference sub-themes included:

*Re-imagining commemoration: WW1 and beyond
*Re-imagining space for challenging history
*Re-imagining participation | experience | engagement
*Re-imagining authenticity
*Re-imagining digital
*Re-imagining the political dimensions of museums' work
*Re-imagining relationships | audiences | visitors
*Re-imagining empathy
*Re-imagining silence
*Re-imagining value
*Re-imagining social justice</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://challenginghistorynetwork.wordpress.com/2016-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visitor Survey Questionnaires - Caernarfon</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A98C50F8-5145-40AA-B210-A252F54FF22C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A large quantity of qualitative data was gathered on people's responses to the travelling poppy exhibition at Caernarfon Castle</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Museums and Heritage Show</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F99DD02-1749-48D7-B65C-98A6B733D280</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation prompted an interesting discussion and several requests for information about the network.

The Explorer Manager, Alex Drago, created a campaign called 'Why Remember?' inspired by three questions from the project (Why should we remember? Why is 100 years so significant? And, how would you like to remember?), and which has been embedded in all HRP's offers and across audiences. The purpose of the campaign is to transform understanding of First World War by encouraging everyone to engage in more meaningful discussion about remembrance.

It includes:
1. UNCOVER (ADULT LEARNING) TALKS AND WORKSHOPS:
(i) 'Curious connections: spies' (58 delegates);
(ii) 'Curious connections: war and friendship' (46 delegates);
(iii) 'War declared: the Tower and the First World War '(24 delegates).

2. UNCOVER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT:
Blackfriars residential home reminiscence work (80 delegates).
 

3. EXPLORER (CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE): 
 
INFORMAL:
(i) 10,000 Soldier's Small Book - a family trail - printed and distributed between Aug 4th - Nov 11th;
(ii) 2,500 contacts during half-term covering a range of activities including object handling, story-telling, costumed-interpretation;
(iii) Echoes &amp;amp; Traces: The Tower at War, performances by Arcola Youth Theatre took place at the Tower of London on Nov 4th in a site-specific performance based on real-life people who lived or worked at the Tower during the First World War. 500 Estimated contacts.
 
FORMAL:
(i) Partnership with Discovery Education who broadcast a national assembly from the Tower of London on Nov 10th with content based around the Why Remember? questions. It featured poetry originally written by students for the Commemorating the Centenary of the Great War film from Grey Coat Hospital School. Discovery marketed this to all schools in the UK, USA, and Canada and it was broadcast free online at http://www.discoveryeducationuk.com/remembrance. 850,000 pupils watched the assembly. Two teacher CPD webinars were broadcast before and after which together reached approximately 500 teachers; (ii) Why Remember? schools campaign and fundraising day. Resources available online and CPD delivered. 100,000 people are involved in the fundraising campaign. It is not yet possible to estimate how much will be raised for the six service charities; (iii) Two animation projects with Pakeman and Mayflower Primary, numbering around 500 contacts and the output of two short movies. Mayflower was previously known as Upper North Street School and was the first known civilian air raid casualty in the world. German planes dropped bombs on the school on 13th June 1917 and 18 students were killed; (iv) 1,000 teacher guides to the poppies and the First World War at the Tower distributed by Nov 11th.

DIGITAL:
(i) #whyremember campaign has reached approx 100,000 people. We asked people to respond to the three questions and send us their photos;
(ii) Both Curious connections talks have been recorded and will end up on our iTunesU account. Numbers of downloads are difficult to estimate. Probably around 1,000 each over the next 12 months.

ATTITUDINAL ANALYSIS:
(i) Physical and online survey to encourage everyone to communicate their responses to the three questions with a long-term view to doing some attitudinal analysis revealing a snapshot of our attitudes to the FWW during the centenary year. Estimated responses around 2,000.

The education and learning programme developed at HRP on the basis of the network was instrumental in the successful award of IRO status in 2015.

We have since used the 'Why Remember?' learning programme to do visitor research at the sites of the travelling poppy exhibitions. This includes Woodhorn Museum, Yorkshire Sculpture Park and Liverpool St Georges. 

The PI has also used the 'Why Remember?' questions when liaising with community groups writing Heritage Lottery Fund bids related to the centenary of the First World War.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CBD1D8B3-C0C9-41E1-BEBD-5D7A2E9B3ECF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The significant achievements: 1. The interdisciplinary group of 27 academics and museum and heritage site practitioners developed a framework for investigating centenary events. 2. The project led to two successful funding bids to the Universities of Sheffield and Birmingham for undergraduate research projects associated with the network, one to create a 'History Pin' project and one to carry out visitor response surveys of the 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' ('Poppy Exhibition') at the Tower of London (analysis ongoing). 3. The blog has had 2,686 views since the launch, from 42 countries. This blog was set up as a discussion forum for participants in the network as opposed to an outward facing driver to content and the network's activities. 4.
