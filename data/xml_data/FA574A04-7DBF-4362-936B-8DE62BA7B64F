&lt;p>Defence lawyers have expressed concern that the use of special measures may prejudice the defence by suggesting to the jury that the complainant needs protection from the defendant.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Others have voiced fears that the effect of video-mediated testimony, in particular, may be diminished relative to evidence delivered 'live and in the flesh', leading jurors to view complainants who take advantage of these measures less positively. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Against this backdrop, the aim of this research is to empirically examine the influence of the use of special measures by adult rape complainants on mock juror deliberation. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>In a context in which the Contempt of Court Act prohibits the conduct of research with 'real' jurors, this project will undertake a series of rape trial reconstructions.

In this respect, the research has had an impact in so far as our key findings have been taken on board and widely circulated by the Crown Prosecution Service and the Judicial College. The research was included in a bulletin sent to all the Heads of Crown Prosecution Service Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Units and all rape specialist prosecutors in England and Wales. References to the research were also included in the latest, revised version of the Equal Treatment Bench Book (2013) produced by Judicial College. The Equal Treatment Bench Book is a principal source of guidance about trial related matters and the treatment of victims and witnesses for judges, magistrates and all other judicial office-holders in England and Wales. In addition, the research and its findings have been taken on board by a number of police forces, Rape Crisis and Victim Support. As a consequence, the research has potentially impacted upon the experience of a large number of rape complainants within the criminal trial process, helping to ensure a more informed decision regarding the use of special measures.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E4141646-07DE-4D2F-B377-776CFA9C9C75</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The potential impact of special protective measures on juror decision-making is both a significant consideration in terms of ensuring justice in individual cases and a source of substantial debate amongst commentators and practitioners. Despite this, at least in the context of cases involving adult rape complainants, it has received scant empirical investigation To bridge this knowledge gap, this study investigated the influence of three special measures upon juror perceptions and evaluation of adult rape testimony: (1) live links; (2) video recorded evidence-in-chief followed by live link cross-examination; and (3) protective screens. 



Summary of Key Findings

* Use of special measures had no consistent impact upon juror evaluation of rape testimony

* Jurors' responses furnished no clear or consistent evidence of reduced emotional impact when video-mediated testimony was used, relative to evidence delivered 'live and in the flesh'

* Mode of presentation did not substantially impact upon jurors' perceptions of credibility

* Mode of presentation did not substantially impact upon jurors' perceptions of trial fairness



The methods used in this research offer an improvement upon those used in many previous mock studies. That said, there are a number of limitations which mean that it would be inappropriate to make uncritical or automatic extrapolations to the real jury room, but equally, it is important also not to over-state the significance of these limitations, particularly bearing in mind the present inability to conduct research into deliberations with 'real' jurors in England and Wales. 



To the extent that our findings indicate that there is no predictable or consistent influence associated with divergent modes of testimony delivery in adult rape cases, they should go some way towards assuaging the concerns of critics and - in a context in which previous research has strongly indicated that their use is welcomed by vulnerable witnesses themselves - they should give advocates greater confidence in encouraging complainants of sexual offences to make use of protective special measures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study provides a vital contribution to the currently limited evidence base in regard to the impact of Special Measures on jurors' evaluation of testimony by complainants in rape cases. 



Our findings will be of interest and potential value to a wide range of non-academic stakeholders (including public and third sector beneficiaries, as well as criminal law practitioners and judges, and individual rape complainants) and key support organizations, such as Rape Crisis and Victim Support. In addition, a range of policy-makers and practitioners involved in representing, or evaluating, rape claims in the UK (including key CPS personnel and regional police sexual assault investigators) have indicated that they consider the research to be valuable and important. 



In sum, the study's findings contribute significantly to our knowledge of the impact of Special Measures on jurors' evaluations of complainant testimony in rape cases, and will, as a consequence, help to provide a more informed basis upon which prosecutors can decide whether and when to request them. Other criminal justice professionals / support organizations will additionally be in a more informed position when advising adult rape complainants about the potential effects of special measures use.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7E5F00F7-6C97-4EDE-A2F6-6CD8ABC5DF04</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Findings taken into account by Scottish Parliament Justice Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7365A2A3-2D65-4E95-835C-9EBEB5B979BC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/92B2D534-7E10-4B5B-8EA9-E06AB892C815"><gtr:id>92B2D534-7E10-4B5B-8EA9-E06AB892C815</gtr:id><gtr:title>'What's so Special about Special Measures?
