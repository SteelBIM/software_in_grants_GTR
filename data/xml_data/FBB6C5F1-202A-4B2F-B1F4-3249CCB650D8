This work breaks completely new ground in demonstrating that water and carbon dioxide can be used as environmentally benign solvents in the manufacture of organic compounds for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. A novel high pressure flow reactor will be built that will allow engineers and scientists to take advantage of the complementary solvent powers of carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide and water will be intimately contacted through an emulsion generated by an ultrasonic device. This will enable compounds of differing polarities to be soluble in either solvent and so reactions can occur at the solvent interface. The reactor therefore has the potential to be used for the manufacture of a wide range of organic chemicals for industry. It is clear that the high value added chemical industry sector will need to move to the continuous flow mode in order to improve efficiency and economy of scale as well as to contain the issues of waste disposal. The reactor will address this requirement and will also remove the stumbling block associated with high pressure (supercritical) carbon dioxide reactions by side stepping the problems associated with the solubility of polar compounds in non-polar carbon dioxide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101806</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at CSIRO Victoria, Australia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA66632C-1B0E-45A8-B19E-077DABBCAD4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards

This has clear benefits to health and the environment, but also has benefits from a process point of view. In some reactions it was possible to separate the product from the reaction mixture by depressurising the CO2 or decanting the product from the top of the water phase and therefore alleviated the need for organic solvents in the separation step. 



The research has side-stepped the problems associated with the solubility of polar compounds in pressurised CO2 through the development of a novel high pressure system that has enabled compounds of differing polarities to be intimately contacted through a water-CO2 emulsion generated by an ultrasonic source. A high pressure ultrasonic system was designed and constructed to enable the formation of these emulsions at elevated conditions. The power density, emulsion size, volume fraction and stability were characterised using a high pressure view flow cell constructed in-house. Over the conditions studied the emulsions were found to be CO2 in water emulsions with average sizes of 0.5 microns at a power density of 0.4 W/cm3 at 20 kHz. 



The system was validated by studying a number of industrially important reactions, such as the Suzuki-Miyaura (SM) reaction, reductive aminations and propargylamine synthesis. The SM reaction proceeds in an alkali environment, however the pH of the water-CO2 emulsions was too low for the reaction to give high yield. Even with high mole equivalents of sodium hydroxide base, and using iodobenzene as the aryl halide the reaction only gave a 41% yield at 80 oC, 160 bar. Lower temperature and weaker bases (sodium- and potassium carbonate) gave poorer yields. Pressure was found to have a positive effect on yield.



The research progressed to a reaction that proceeded favourably under acidic conditions. Reductive aminations were conducted using simple carbonyl compounds and primary amines with chemical reducing agents in a one-pot process at room temperature and 80 bar for one hour. The results showed mixed success with aniline yielding higher product (76 to 89%) due to its lower pKa value. 4-methoxybenzylamine with a higher pka gave lower yield and was observed by high pressure IR spectroscopy to sequester the CO2 more strongly hindering its participation in the reaction. In order to understand the effect of process conditions and to reduce chemical costs the formation of the imine, an intermediate in the reductive amination, was studied. The formation of CO2-water emulsions was found to enhance imine yield, compared to systems containing water alone. In systems where CO2 was present but no emulsions were formed the yield was less than that of water alone. Low pressure (40 bar) resulted in imine yields between 58 to 70%, whereas higher pressure (105 and 140 bar) gave lower yields over the entire temperature range. Higher temperature led to an increased kinetics and imine yield, however above 85 oC the yield became independent of temperature at higher pressure (140 bar) due to lack of emulsion formation. 

Where reactant concentration resulted in the formation of an excess phase high imine yields were obtained, which were attributed to reactant availability at the emulsion interphase as a result of enhanced mass transfer from sonication. 



Preliminary studies into propargylamine synthesis showed favourable results. The reaction of piperidine, benzaldehyde and phenylacetylene using a copper iodide catalyst gave the oxazolidine product in 80% (unoptimised). This exceeds literature values for the same reaction conducted in supercritical CO2. Importantly, the product fixes CO2 into its structure which is beneficial from an environmental perspective, but in addition sub-stoichiometric amounts of catalyst were used which has favourable industrial implications. This research has broken new ground in creating a new environmentally benign synthesis process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The technology is currently being explored to process food products and waste. As well as the above, the results showed that elevated pressure sonication could also be used to cause cell death. We have since applied this technology to process dairy products and have shown that an equivalent pasteurisation can be undertaken at less than 20-fold the energy requirement used in normal pasteurisation. We have filed a patent in this area and have been working with a major multi-national dairy through Innovate UK to further develop this technology.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>00AB690F-594A-4AF8-AC11-25161CA15A08</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1A09B0D-89D6-4218-8BF9-6830FE300251"><gtr:id>B1A09B0D-89D6-4218-8BF9-6830FE300251</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ultrasound-induced emulsification of subcritical carbon dioxide/water with and without surfactant as a strategy for enhanced mass transport.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ultrasonics sonochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/41e76096e3d64aa14e5188d74d9bb3c7"><gtr:id>41e76096e3d64aa14e5188d74d9bb3c7</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cenci SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1350-4177</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1BB2EF52-37CB-4E3C-A0AA-F6BF6E18508D"><gtr:id>1BB2EF52-37CB-4E3C-A0AA-F6BF6E18508D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Recent Advances in Catalysis for Efficient Process Chemistry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Recent Patents on Catalysise</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/baf457dc7f276481f3c5f4a0685180c8"><gtr:id>baf457dc7f276481f3c5f4a0685180c8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cenci S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2F7CCDC1-D015-4ECD-B5EB-224048945D8D"><gtr:id>2F7CCDC1-D015-4ECD-B5EB-224048945D8D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ultrasound-Induced CO2/H2O Emulsions as a Medium for Clean Product Formation and Separation: The Barbier Reaction as a Synthetic Example</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS Sustainable Chemistry &amp;
