and performance of carbon capture materials (CCMs) yet attempted. We believe the findings from this study will mark a
major leap forward into understanding of manufacturing low cost and efficient CCMs with unique properties and
applications. A systematic investigation will be carried out to examine the performance of the molecularly imprinted
polymers (MIP) synthesized for CO2 capture through suspension polymerisation technique. This research involves the
application of a powerful set of complementary techniques to the study of synthesis and performance of prepared MIPs
comprising: HRSEM,TEM, XRD, adsorbing/desorbing rig, gas analyser. A substantially better understanding of the
synthesis process and performance of MIPs is likely to yield important economic benefits, e.g. better process control,
efficiency, improved reproducibility and the capacity to modify products for specific applications. Such a step forward to a
new level of understanding would open the way to innovative applications in both residential and industrial emission emitter
systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The programme will have a high level of interaction with industry and public to maximize the impact of this research. Initial
discussions about the project will make use of existing network as a way to raise the project's profile and to identify
potential partners for future exploitation of the research results. Some actions are highlighted as follows.
All investigators and researchers will be actively engaged with the UKCCSRC.
Headline results will be disseminated by regular liaison with the Biomass Energy Center (BEC) and contacts within DECC,
Defra and OFGEM, while the more detailed research findings will be disseminated through conventional academic
publications.
A workshop will be organized in partnership with the UKCCSRC during the project period. The workshops will promote a
high level of participation, attract a high proportion of industrialists and provide a stimulating and lively forum for the
discussion of the most up to date issues in development of a well-controlled carbon capture system with maximum
efficiency.
The investigators will work with the Press Officer in Cranfield University, who will organize press releases about news,
progress and events associated with this project to web-based, local and national media. Recent examples includes the
BBC One Show &amp;quot;Best Way to Board&amp;quot; videoed in Cranfield. Similar opportunities will be explored.
Ultimately society will benefit from this project if the research work actually leads to increased deployment of carbon
capture systems. The success of this project will open up the possibility for commercial exploitation of advanced energy
technologies. All the investigators are very experienced in industrial and international collaborations. The PI and
Researcher Co-I has been coordinating EU Marie Curie Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways (IAPP) projects,
and successfully delivered 10+ Industrial CASE Award, KTP, TSB projects. Many of the outcomes of this programme, such
as high efficiency carbon capture materials, fluidized reactor concepts and monitoring system could be further explored via
those routes with industrial relevance. It is likely that some proposed research activities are expected to lead to exploitable
results.
The newly established Center for Bioenergy and Resource Management has 35 PhD students, and 5 postdoc researchers
and is expected at least 3 new Postdoc joining in each year. Considering the current funding shortfall for Post-doc
researcher, that one new member from Cranfield will bring new blood of young researchers.
The full impact of research will be in line with the standard practice in the partners' universities. Therefore no resources will
be requested beyond staff and travel costs and consumables identified in the Justification of Resources.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>147621</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Formula VIII conference (Barcelona)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C0566CF-EBD1-4F49-950B-FB54069BA890</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More than 50 peoples saw our work as a poster presentation.
