We are trying to understand how different parts of this protein machinery work together. 
Our work is focused on a conserved protein called Mcm10, which connects parts of the DNA replication machinery and is vital for the DNA copying process. We have recently solved the molecular structure of human Mcm10. The structure is a ring formed by six Mcm10 molecules. This gives us a very good idea of how this important protein may connect parts of the DNA copy machinery and DNA at the same time. The structure and a powerful multidisciplinary approach give us an excellent starting platform for molecular and cell biology studies of Mcm10. 
Recent advances show that proteins, which form DNA replication machinery, are attractive targets for the development of new treatments against human disease such as cancer. Understanding the Mcm10?s molecular blueprint and its role in DNA copying process will help in designing novel therapeutic agents, which will selectively target and eliminate cancer cells without damaging normal healthy cells.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The protein machinery controlling DNA replication is a major regulator of cell growth in human tissues and is frequently deregulated in cancer. Initiation of DNA replication is tightly regulated and starts with the ordered assembley of origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, Cdt1 and Mcm2-7 proteins into pre-replicative complexes (preRCs). These preRCs are activated by CDKs and Cdc7/Dbf4 kinase and the loading of Mcm10 protein. The latter event triggers the transition from preRC to pre-initiation complex (preIC) which is followed by the recruitment of Cdc45 and the DNA polymerase-a machinery.
Emerging data point to the existence of a DNA replication initiation checkpoint which monitors the assembly of a critical number of preRCs. When initiation of DNA replication is blocked it results in an apoptotic response in cancer cells and reversible cell cycle arrest in normal cells. This makes preRC formation and the transition to the preIC a promising target for anticancer therapies capable of blocking cellular proliferation without causing genotoxic stress.
The Mcm10 DNA replication initiation factor is a conserved nuclear protein critical for origin activation. During the preRC to preIC transition Mcm10 is vital for origin unwinding and provides a link between the Mcm2-7 replicative helicase and DNA polymerases. The properties of Mcm10 as an integral part of the replication machinery initiation make it an important target for therapeutic intervention. 
We have recently solved the first structure of human Mcm10 by using electron microscopy and image analysis. The Mcm10 molecule is a ring-shaped hexamer. The structure suggests a model of how this protein may serve as a connector between the Mcm2-7 helicase and DNA polymerase. The ring-shaped molecule may serve as a docking platform for assembly of the molecular machinery required for initiation of DNA replication. The structure allows us to predict the areas of DNA binding, major domain boundaries and positions of Zn-fingers potentially involved in DNA binding and/or protein-protein interaction. 
This model gives us the structural background to start molecular and cell biology studies of the Mcm10 structure-function relationship. We now aim to obtain detailed information on functional domains of Mcm10 involved in DNA-binding and protein-protein interaction. The knowledge gained from this project would be invaluable for understanding the molecular mechanisms behind DNA replication initiation. Apart from its fundamental scientific importance, detailed insight into Mcm10 activities will be directly applicable to the development of novel anti-cancer agents targeting the DNA replication initiation machinery thus selectively eliminating cancer cells.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>398803</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Interaction between Mcm10 and SIRT1 histone deacetylase</gtr:description><gtr:id>9E9062F4-6B61-40E6-BB27-B600D96D2CC8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this is strategic collaboration with the lab whose expertise is based on cell biology of SIRT1. having collaboration with this lab cut down time for experimental set up tremedously allowing us to focus on elucidating mechanism of SIRT1-dependent regulation of Mcm10</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>siRNA design, antibodies and cell lines from the group with expertise in SIRT1</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>we identified SIRT1 as an interactive partner of Mcm10.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL Research Department of Primary Care &amp; Population Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>Mass spectrometry of Mcm10 acetylation sites</gtr:description><gtr:id>057CC1DF-386D-4829-B198-B00BCA08C7E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>we have mapped most of lysine residues within Mcm10 sequence that are acetylated by p300 acetyltransferase and subsequently deacetylated by SIRT1</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our collaborators provided mass spectroscopy analysis of our Mcm10 acetylated samples produced in vivo and vitro</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>we have supplied samples of acetylated (and deacetylated) Mcm10 and its domains</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Bioscinces and Bioresources, Italian National Council of Research, Naples, Italy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mcm10 interaction with Cdc45</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8BE20C8-5862-428A-8262-0FB0464B756A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The physical interaction of Mcm10 with Cdc45 modulates their DNA binding properties&amp;quot; manuscript is under review in Nucleic Acid Research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Cdc45-Mcm10 interaction, protein- DNA interaction</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>joint experiments on Mcm10-Cdc45 replication protein interaction and its importance in DNA replication initiation.
