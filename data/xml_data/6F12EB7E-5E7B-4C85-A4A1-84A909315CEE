People find it hard to initiate movements and often make smaller movements, such as taking shorter steps. Currently, cues are used to improve people?s movements, for example, markers on the floor to encourage longer steps. This project will investigate another possible way of eliciting movements in Parkinson?s - imitation. Even just watching a movement primes people to make the same movement themselves, tapping into movement areas of their brain.This could facilitate movements in Parkinson?s, but there has been little research into imitation in Parkinson?s.&lt;br />&lt;br />This project will examine how effectively imitation can improve movement in people with Parkinson?s, compared to a group of healthy volunteers of a similar age. They will copy a simple sequence of hand movements from a video clip and this will be compared to when they are instructed verbally to make the hand movements. Measuring the speed and distance that they move their hand will reveal how effective their movements are. Understanding how Parkinson?s affects imitation will inform the development of therapeutic interventions and day-to-day strategies using imitation, which have the potential to improve the quality of life of people with Parkinson?s.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will produce the scientific groundwork to inform the design of therapeutic interventions involving imitation for people with Parkinson's. Using a behavioural intervention to improve their significant and disabling motor symptoms has the potential to improve the quality of life of people with Parkinson's and of their family and carers in a cost-effective manner. This could have widespread benefits since Parkinson's affects approximately 1 in 500 people and is estimated to cost the UK up to 3.3 billion annually (Findley, 2007). Our findings may also inform the use of imitation to promote healthy ageing.

The immediate beneficiaries of our research findings will be other researchers and practitioners (cognitive neuroscientists, physiotherapists, neurologists) who may develop new therapeutic interventions based on imitation or use our findings to drive further research. Researchers developing technology to support interventions may also benefit from our findings. To ensure that such interested parties are able to access and use our findings, we will hold a multidisciplinary workshop on Parkinson's and imitation in year 3 of the grant, to discuss our findings and other relevant research (see Pathways to Impact for more details). We will also disseminate our findings widely, to multidisciplinary audiences by targeting conferences and journal articles that reach Parkinson's researchers and practitioners (see Academic Beneficiaries for details). This will be facilitated by the breadth of our research team.

People with Parkinson's and practitioners who work with them (such as nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists) may also benefit immediately from our findings, which may inspire changes in their day-to-day lives or to their practice. For example, imitation could be emphasised more strongly in exercise programmes for people with Parkinson's or a carer might be able to use a type of imitation to help a person with Parkinson's who is &amp;quot;frozen&amp;quot;. Hence, we will target people with Parkinson's via talks and articles in newsletters and target practitioners who work with people with Parkinson's via talks and training events (see Pathways to Impact for more details). Raising interest and awareness of imitation will also be important with regard to the development and trialling of interventions involving imitation. In year 3 of the grant, we will apply for local funding to collect pilot data for an imitation training intervention based on our findings, in a small number of participants (N=5). Together with the results of the proposed project, this will form the basis of a larger project to test the therapeutic efficacy of an imitation-based intervention. This might involve exercise or physiotherapy interventions incorporating imitation and could involve imitation of instructors or use technology (e.g. avatars). We anticipate that such interventions could be more widely available within 5-6 years.

We also anticipate that our patient representative and other people with Parkinson's involved in discussing the research at our workshop (see Pathways to Impact) and at local groups, as well as some of the participants, may benefit personally from the opportunity to be involved in the research project, as well as to discuss and influence our research. There will also be longer-term impact from training the post-doctoral researcher working on this project over the course of the project. They will gain experience in working in a cross-disciplinary team, as well as communicating with others outside their field and to the general public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313384</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dramatic performance as an output of an outreach project with Women Asylum Seekers Together (WAST).

Users of this research include other researchers outside of our immediate collaborators, who may also capitalise on our findings and apply them to the design of interventions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>06EC302C-B7D7-4C7F-9C37-3CD0101936E7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://beamlab.lab.manchester.ac.uk/research/imitation/imitationandparkinsons/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/30934005-EB4D-402E-A64F-B16406F3E23F"><gtr:id>30934005-EB4D-402E-A64F-B16406F3E23F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enhancing voluntary imitation through attention and motor imagery.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Experimental brain research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a374c052f958f3d186f7ba8f2df7b2b9"><gtr:id>a374c052f958f3d186f7ba8f2df7b2b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bek J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0014-4819</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CE4A6664-2CBD-4E0D-9C18-12253BF09C72"><gtr:id>CE4A6664-2CBD-4E0D-9C18-12253BF09C72</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patients' views on a combined action observation and motor imagery intervention for Parkinson's disease</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parkinson's Disease</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8b0a084ccc944cb150f0efddccd03e07"><gtr:id>8b0a084ccc944cb150f0efddccd03e07</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bek, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/168C9DCF-4522-41CE-97C7-4AB6FF40297E"><gtr:id>168C9DCF-4522-41CE-97C7-4AB6FF40297E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Patients' Views on a Combined Action Observation and Motor Imagery Intervention for Parkinson's Disease.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Parkinson's disease</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a374c052f958f3d186f7ba8f2df7b2b9"><gtr:id>a374c052f958f3d186f7ba8f2df7b2b9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bek J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2042-0080</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K013564/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E457FFDE-A4C1-4907-AE12-A394D95A3AE5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cognitive Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E1AC33C6-9927-41AC-B23B-2EED8F593588</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Experimental Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
