Particular attention is paid to the future vulnerabilities and potential weaknesses of UK, US and NATO nuclear capabilities, as well as to the impact this is having on the perception and efficacy of nuclear weapons more broadly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main aim of the project is to provide a badly needed assessment of how the role of nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy is changing in the modern world, and to begin a debate over whether such weapons continue to represent viable a means of security&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit three groups that together not only help formulate and implement policy ideas surrounding cyber strategy, nuclear weapons and national security, but also subject those ideas to critical intellectual scrutiny; (1) policy makers with responsibility for nuclear weapons and cyber security strategy; (2) internationally renowned and internationally active think tanks and professional research institutes seeking to influence the climate of opinion surrounding nuclear and national security strategies; and (3) an interdisciplinary range of social scientists with a concern for understanding the implications of cyber for international security and nuclear strategy. Throughout the project the aim will be to present my research in ways that maximise its potential to serve the interests of these varied user groups, thus ensuring the best possible chance of disseminating research in forms that will be of most use to the major stakeholders. This will avoid the pitfalls that can arise from an overly generic method of communicating findings, and allow me to deepen my links with non-academic users by consciously setting out to bridge the gap between the academic and policy worlds.

Primarily the work will be of benefit to those inside of the formal policy-making system within the UK, US and NATO. The proposed research provides timely analysis of the up-to-date trends in the international security environment and how this might affect national and alliance/ IO thinking, security and strategy. Specifically, it provides the first major study of how new cyber challenges will impact and shape thinking about the continued utility of nuclear weapons and nuclear deterrence as central tools and as the ultimate 'guarantors' of security. Given the fact that cyber appears as a major component in the strategies of each one of the project's nuclear stakeholders, this work will feed into discussions about how future strategic planning can be balanced with ever-tighter security resource allocation.

A wide range of internationally-orientated and internationally-active think tanks and professional research institutes both in the UK and overseas will also benefit from my proposed research. While these bodies commission and publish research into cyber security and nuclear strategy, these have remained discrete areas of study, leaving the cyber-nuclear nexus largely untouched. By offering rigorous analysis on this issue, and by bridging the gap between cyber and nuclear research, my proposed project adds to the pool of knowledge available to those who are involved in this vital function of ensuring a more rounded climate of ideas. I have already established links with a number of non-academic stakeholders through my close links with the transatlantic CSIS and RUSI Project on Nuclear Issues, and while many of these actors may well be outside of the formal policy-making structure, they are no less important to the overall functioning of the system.

Finally, scholars concerned with the details of nuclear weapons policy and the implications of cyber warfare will also be interested in this research. For those national security scholars interested in UK, US and NATO nuclear and defence strategy in the cyber age, my work provides a timely addition to debates about how best to respond to changing strategic realities. For those studying global security trends, my work contributes to the burgeoning yet nascent literature seeking to conceptualise and understand what cyber means for international security. Finally, for those whose scholarly concern is nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, my work presents an innovative contribution to the literature surrounding nuclear strategy, stability and disarmament. Due to the nature of research, my articles and dissemination strategy are also designed to ensure the widest possible incorporation of my research findings into scholarly networks beyond UK Political Science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166438</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Impact of emerging technologies on the future of SSBN's workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C41D48CC-C750-4E1D-81DF-AC3C8CD1E3DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop held in conjunction with BASIC and UK Pugwash in London to examine the impact of emerging technologies on the future of UK nuclear thinking,</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.basicint.org/publications/sebastian-brixey-williams-project-leader/2016/report-impact-emerging-technologies</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online article on UK nuclear weapons policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CB2C8A4-BFDC-470A-B260-2B89EB84A00D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article was access by over 1000 readers from all over the world, and has led to email correspondence for many readers.

It was also widely discussed in Parliament at the time of the Trident renewal vote in 2016. 

I have been contacted by numerous media outlets for expert analysis and been quoted in both UK and international press, and my research has been cited and syndicated in both UK national newspapers.

I was asked to contribute to a Parliamentary study looking at cyber threats to UK nuclear weapons in 2016.

I have been asked to join a high-profile think-tank led study into the cyber threat to nuclear command and control based in the United States. The findings of this report will go directly to the US government.

I have submitted evidence to and been directly cited by two UK Government Defence Reviews (2015 and 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>685660D6-BF82-4237-B9C2-B28AFD843F1A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Cyber is an inherently contested concept, and the lack of an accepted definition and terms of use has obfuscated the debate and fuelled cyber hype. To address this problem, I have developed my own novel framework for addressing the cyber challenge to nuclear weapons in the broadest possible manner. The cyber challenge is therefore best thought of as a context or lens through which to view the nuclear weapons enterprise, as well as a specific set of &amp;quot;weapons&amp;quot;.

The cyber challenge is primarily exacerbating tensions and vulnerabilities that already exist with the nuclear enterprise and particularly in the safe and secure management of nuclear command and control. In this way it is drawing our attention back to the inherent pressures and problems that have always been important but have perhaps escaped our attention more recently. 

That said, cyber is unquestionably creating new problems, ways in and vulnerabilities that can be exploited. These are likely to become even more acute as states modernise and further digitise all aspects of their nuclear weapons management systems and make them more complex. 

Cyber-attacks span a wide spectrum, from simple hacking and espionage up to activities designed to cause damage and destruction. Cyber-nuclear espionage is by far the biggest challenge in this regard; cyber-sabotage the most worrying. Cyber interference is the most likely threat posed by terrorists and non-state actors.

The cyber challenge involves both passive threats, that is problems that are inherent in nuclear weapons systems due to their complexity and because of 'bugs' and that might lead to accidents or miscalculation, and active threats from those deliberately seeking to hack into and interfere with these systems. 

We also need to differentiate between types of attack: states are more likely to pursue disabling activities aimed at undermining systems; non-state groups are more likely to pursue enabling attacks designed to cause miscalculation and/ or nuclear use. 

There are certain vulnerabilities arising from cyber for the UK nuclear weapons complex but these are subtler than &amp;quot;cyber hype&amp;quot; would suggest. That said, they do add to the pressures on the perceived role and utility of UK nuclear weapons in the future, and the veracity and invulnerability of the Trident system in particular.

Cyber is creating a range of new pressures for global strategic balances, and will have negative impact of future arms control and strategic stability unless moves are taken to mitigate these risks. This is particularly the case when cyber is included alongside other emerging strategic technologies.

The best way to manage the cyber-nuclear future is to keep nuclear weapons systems simple, safe, and secure. Only then can we look to build confidence, share good practice, and perhaps investigate the possibilities of various moratoria or arms control initiatives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings are already being taken forward in two main fora, both directly by the UK and US governments, and indirectly by a number of professional institutions and bodies that seek to share the climate of ideas surround cyber and nuclear policy.

(1) Firstly, my findings will form the basis of the high-level report into cyber threats and nuclear weapons that will be submitted by the Nuclear Threat Initiative to the US government in 2017. This will go directly to the Trump administration as they go about setting nuclear policy, and will also help shape the climate of ideas that surround these decisions in Washington.

(2) My findings are also increasingly being used by the UK government as it seeks firstly to guard against and mitigate new threats to the UK's nuclear deterrent system, and at the same time seeks diplomatic initiatives to prevent the further spread of nuclear weapons internationally that might be caused by developments in cyber capabilities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B0C3BEBA-3CEC-433F-99B2-177467AEDA44</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence submitted to UK Defence Select Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03AB18A1-FF3E-425C-8B7F-B7E3CB310E0F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/defence-committee/an-sdsr-checklist-of-potential-threats/written/22333.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence submitted to UK House of Commons Defence Committee and cited in Report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A61B2017-A9D5-4103-A906-47A279E32BC5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmdfence/1066/1066.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Briefing to the UK Parliamentary Top Level Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EB802C2-9F57-465F-80B5-E1C90AFB999D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/51A09E30-B0A9-4357-B00D-3C1D8FF1D033"><gtr:id>51A09E30-B0A9-4357-B00D-3C1D8FF1D033</gtr:id><gtr:title>War Games redux?
