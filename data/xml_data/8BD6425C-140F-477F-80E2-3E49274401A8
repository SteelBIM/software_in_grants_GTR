for sustainable engineering applications</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K02910X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The ability to generate strong and stable magnetic fields is a critical enabling technology for a broad range of sustainable engineering applications. Almost invariably, more compact field sources and higher magnetic field densities lead directly to more efficient and cost effective devices. One example of this can be found in the widespread applications of small, high power DC electric motors, which have proliferated since the development of the cheap high energy density family of NdFeB materials in the 1980s. Wire-wound superconducting magnets, on the other hand, may offer the potential to generate large magnetic fields, but they are extremely expensive and are difficult to manufacture. A cheaper, simpler and more robust option is the use of magnetised bulk superconductors. The (RE)BCO (where RE = rare earth element such as Y, Nd, Sm, Gd, etc.) family of bulk, melt processed high temperature superconductors (HTS), in particular, is the subject of extensive world-wide developmental research. Bulk HTS materials offer considerable potential to both improve the performance of existing devices that incorporate permanent magnets and to develop new, high field and sustainable energy storage applications, in particular. Indeed, these materials represent a direct link between the physical sciences and the development of sustainable applications in the energy needs sector that will be fundamental to growth of the UK economy in the short to medium term.

A number of important scientific and technical challenges to the incorporation of (RE)BCO bulk superconducting materials into practical engineering applications remain. These include improving process efficiency, sample properties, yield, reducing the cost of raw materials, recycling, processing larger samples with conformal geometries, development of a practical magnetisation process and the development of bespoke cryogenic systems for specific applications.

The main objective of this proposal is to address and overcome the critical aspects of these challenges to gain a fundamental understanding of the single grain growth process. This will enable the cost-effective processing of (RE)BCO materials with conformal geometries that will be fundamental to their application in a range of sustainable engineering devices within the energy sector and healthcare industry. Specific emphasis of the project will be placed on the development of an effective recycling process to enable a new secondary bulk sample source for low to medium field applications, the development of a novel multi-seeding technique for fabricating large samples of conformal geometry and the development of a novel fabrication process based on a graded composition to produce bulk samples with homogeneous superconducting properties throughout the bulk microstructure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project will be particularly significant for the Cambridge Group and the collaborators, building on an outstanding research and collaboration track record. The project will also benefit both industry and academia worldwide: 1. Engineering industries involved in the manufacture of magnetic bearings, flywheel energy storage systems, high field permanent magnet devices and magnetic separators; 2. Companies manufacturing permanent magnet MRI/NMR systems; 3. High efficiency, compact motors and generators. Researchers working on magnetic and transport properties, solidification and phase kinetics of (RE)BCO materials will also benefit directly from the results of the project. Samples will be supplied to the relevant UK academic institutions and schools free of charge, as required.

The main mechanism for impact and exploitation is via the established collaboration with Boeing Company, which has a number of large, active (propriety) projects with potential users of bulk material in energy storage flywheel systems and other applications such as non-destructive testing. This is a ready-made market, and offers a unique opportunity for the UK to make a major impact on HTS technology on an international scale. Unfortunately the details of these projects are proprietary, although they represent a combined potential market of tens of millions of dollars in the medium to long term. State of the art bulk material developed as part of this project would be retro-fitted into these existing devices (approximately 50 samples in each energy storage flywheel device) to yield a direct route to commercial exploitation. Other emerging applications relevant to developing sustainable engineering technologies include high efficiency, light and compact motors and generators, testing applications requiring a large magnetic field, stable magnetic bearings, fault current limiters and magnetic separators. Boeing has potential interest in these devices, and is well-placed to supply the global market. Cambridge and Boeing have an existing, formal IPR agreement in place, including joint patent interests, and the partnership is well-positioned to fully exploit emerging bulk superconductor technology. The outputs with potential technical and commercial impact will be identified by comparing the properties, manufacturability and cost of state of the art bulk samples with the requirements of global industry, as defined mainly by the Boeing Company. This will provide bench-mark data by which to evaluate the output of the project and enable comparison with competing technology (where it exists). Key properties are the magnitude of trapped field at 77 and 50 K, mechanical strength and production cost, which will be monitored by Boeing as part of the project. In-situ performance of bulk samples in the Boeing energy storage flywheel will provide further technical output to quantify the capability of the bulk materials in an applications-specific environment.

The SRA appointed to the project will undertake the impact activities in close collaboration with the PI. Prof. Cardwell has extensive experience of the generation and protection of IPR, and is well placed to oversee and manage this project. Cambridge Enterprise (a University body established to advise and support the commercial exploitation of emerging technology) will be involved closely with the transfer of manufacturing technology outside the University. Cambridge Enterprise employs specialists in IPR, market research and contract law at no direct cost to the project, and will play a key role in the exploitation of the commercial potential of the material developed during this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>472525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liege</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Liege</gtr:description><gtr:id>52EFC191-0F57-4045-9B6A-6A96D3795225</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2004-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Vienna University of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Atomic and Subatomic Physics (Atominstitut)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Atominstitut der Oester Universitaet</gtr:description><gtr:id>03A7BB46-1B02-4E26-A258-C75F1EA37964</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2004-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>IFW Desden</gtr:description><gtr:id>570DD34C-74F4-4CFE-A958-939B0BEC586A</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2004-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>649885</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Composite bulk superconducting magnets for high field applications</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>EPSRC and CRUK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/P00962X/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>97A8160A-7BB4-41EF-B320-DCEC6CD8B99C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-11-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The bridge seeding technique: Bridge seeding has been used to ensure the alignment of the seeds (2 or more) in the multi-seeding processes in order to understand the properties of grain boundaries of multi-seeded single grains. Large, SmBCO grains up to 20 mm in diameter fabricated by a conventional top seeded melt growth (TSMG) process are selected and cut into bridge-shaped geometries. YBCO single grains fabricated using bridge-shaped seeds with different orientations and of different lengths have been grown successfully. Their microstructure, composition segregation, superconducting properties at the grain boundaries of these single grains have been studied in detail. Three papers have been published on this subject. Larger, multi-seeded single grains up to 32 mm in diameter and bar-shaped multi-seeded samples have been fabricated. The samples fabricated using bridge seeding techniques have attracted attention of the modelling and measurement society and thus were measured in Japan using pulse field magnetisation method, which is in-situ magnetisation method in application. One paper titled &amp;quot;Pulsed field magnetization of 0&amp;deg;-0&amp;deg; and 45&amp;deg;-45&amp;deg; bridge-seeded Y-Ba-Cu-O bulk Superconductors&amp;quot; is published. The most recent research, based on the fabrication of large quantity of multi-seeded samples, has demonstrated that multi-seeded quasi single grains with minimised grain boundaries can be fabricated, with careful control of the distance between the seeds, the size of the seeds (and buffers) and most importantly, the alignment of the seeds. The extent of the grain boundaries can be reduced when the distance between the seeds decreases and the size of the seeds (or buffers) increases under the condition that the seeds are aligned, especially with the help of bridge-shaped seeds or seeds with tailored aspect ratio. As a result, multi-seeding can be used to produce high quality quasi single grains, with minimised grain boundaries at the top surface where the seeds are arranged, and no grain boundaries at the bottom. One paper has been drafted. The buffer seeding technique: A small SmBCO (75wt%Sm-123 25wt%Sm-211) pellet, 0.3 g and 5 mm in diameter, placed between the generic seed and the SmBCO-Ag pellet as a buffer prevents Ag diffusion between the pellet and the seed and prevents the seed from melting. The success rate of the seeding has subsequently improved to almost 100%. As a result of the buffering technique, the SmBCO-Ag system, which has the highest Tc and Jc in the (RE)BCO family of bulk superconductors, is able to be batch melt-processed both successfully and reliably. The buffering technique is now used by the Cambridge group to process other systems, such as YBCO, GdBCO, GdBCO-Ag and SmBCO. Four papers have been submitted to journals on the buffer and related materials research. Buffering technique is now not only established as a general technique in the growth of superconducting single grains, but also used as an extended new technique in the growth of multi-seeded bulk sample. Achieving larger grains from a single seed: YBCO single grains containing graded concentrations of Y-211 CeO2 in U-shaped layers within a cylindrical sample up to 32 mm diameter have been developed and studied in detail, and shown to exhibit improved superconducting properties. Two papers have been published this material research and one paper related modelling based on these samples, titled&amp;quot; Numerical simulation and analysis of single grain YBCO processed from graded precursor powders&amp;quot; is also published. Improved Top-Seeded Melt-Growth: An improved Top-Seeded Melt-Growth process with an adjusted heating profile and composition has been developed and has yielded a higher growth success rate. Larger samples have been fabricated more reliably. A GdBCO-Ag single grain 47mm in diameter has achieved 2.0 T trapped field at 77 K via a Field-cooling process. A shrink-fitting process has been developed to withstand the high interface pressure associated with the high magnetic field generated in single grain bulk material. As a result, the trapped field of GdBCO-Ag single grains can be measured without the samples failing mechanically when high field is applied at low temperature. This technique has led to a world record of trapped field in superconducting bulk materials of 17.6 T. A paper has been published in Superconductor Science and Technology. A reliable recycling technique: Adequate liquid phase is provided at the bottom of the failed sample to help gain back the liquid phase which was lost in the primary growth. The yield of the recycling process is about 90% and the superconducting property, trapped field can reach 70~80% percent of the samples in primary growth, which suggests the process of single grain growth used in the bulk superconductors can be a sustainable engineering process. One paper has been published and another is submitted. This process has been used in recycling failed samples from Adelwitz Technologiezentrum GmbH (Germany) and is confirmed successful again. Furthermore, a two-step infiltration growth technique is developed in our group based on the recycling process, which were inspired by normal infiltration growth. The new two-step infiltration has overcome the issues that there is too much Y-211 particles in the bulk samples, which are not superconducting. The trapped field values of the YBCO single grains has reached same values as that in primary growth YBCO, which is a break through. Two papers have published and another one is going to be submitted. The buffer aid bridge seeding technique: This seeding technique has been used to ensure the alignment of more than two seeds in the large multi-seeding processes though buffers acting as bridge. Instead of cutting large bridge shaped seeds from single grain SmBCO sample, which is time consuming and not easy, lager buffers are acted as bridge, due to that the buffers are acted as hot seeding seeds. This technique is now used to fabricate GdBCOAg 4-seeds seeded samples routinely. Quasi multi-seeded single grains are able to be grown, which is a breakthrough in the society. Large size (RE)BCO (RE = Gd and Y) single grains 41 mm in diameter with improved superconducting properties have attracted attention of the modeling community. Samples of YBCO and GdBCO-Ag have been measured using a pulse magnisation system at different temperatures. A paper entitled &amp;quot;Modelling and comparison of trapped fields in (RE)BCO bulk superconductors for activation using pulsed field magnetization&amp;quot; has been published based on the results of this research. Large, single grains and their superconducting properties have also attracted attention from the applied community, and for application in linear synchronous motors, in particular. Single grain, bulk GdBCO-Ag superconductors of diameter 20 mm, 30 mm and 40 mm have been used in such a device for the first time. Our studies of multi-seeded and single-seeded (RE)BCOAg (RE=Y, Gd and Sm) bulk superconductors of diameter 16, 20, 25, 31, 40 and 47 mm suggest that the key superconducting property of trapped field per unit volume is significantly better in smaller samples. Therefore, multi-seeded or the close packed, assembled composites of (RE)BCO bulk samples are considered to be the preferred form of bulk superconducting material for applications. These new concepts, developed under this project, have formed the basis of new projects that target a wide range of applications..</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E447FE3-B9E2-4614-8DF4-1C8F77452F81</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Bridge seeding
Bridge seeding has been developed to ensure the alignment of the seeds (2 or more) in the multi-seeding processes so that multi-seeded single grains with desired orientation can grow well and the properties of grain boundaries of multi-seeded single grains can be studied without the complication of grain misalignment. Large, single SmBCO grains up to 20 mm in diameter fabricated by a conventional top seeded melt growth (TSMG) process have been selected and cut into bridge-shaped geometries. The two legs of the bridge are used as two seeds with the desired orientation. These so-called 0&amp;deg;-0&amp;deg; and 45&amp;deg;-45&amp;deg; bridge-seeds are labelled according to their relative orientation in the parent grain. These bridges have been prepared successfully with different lengths from 2 to 10 mm for fabricating YBCO single grains. 
2. Buffering technique
A buffering technique has been developed to improve the reliability of the seeding process. Silver (Ag) is an established additive for improving the mechanical properties of single grain, (RE)BCO bulk superconductors (where RE = Sm, Gd and Y). The presence of Ag in the (RE)BCO bulk composition, however, typically reduces the melting temperature of the single crystal seed in the top seeded melt growth (TSMG) process, which complicates significantly the controlled nucleation and subsequent epitaxial growth of a single grain, which is essential for high field engineering applications. The new process involves placing a small, 0.3 g and 5 mm in diameter SmBCO (75wt%Sm123 25wt%Sm211) pellet between the generic seed and the growing SmBCO-Ag pellet as a buffer to prevent Ag diffusion from the pellet to the seed to inhibit melting of the seed. This has improved the seeding success rate almost to 100%. 
3. Achieving Larger grains from a single seed:
Large YBCO and GdBCO-Ag single grains up to 41 mm in diameter can now be fabricated reliably. SmBCO-Ag single grains up to 32 mm in diameter and GdBCO-Ag 48 mm in diameter can now also be fabricated reliably for the first time in 20 years due to the buffering technique. Moreover, YBCO single grains containing graded concentrations of Y-211 CeO2 in U-shaped layers within a cylindrical sample up to 32 mm diameter have been developed and studied in detail, and shown to exhibit improved superconducting properties
4. Improving the TSMG process 
Optimisation of the parameters in the crystal growth process has been carried out. We have studied the importance in controlling the liquid loss during the crystal growth, the effects of precursor particle size on growth, the effects of amount of Y-211 on growth rate and differences and similarities between the Top Seeded Melt-Growth and Infiltration Growth processing techniques. A new analysis technique based on EDX has been developed to examine the chemical composition of solid single grains so that changes in chemical composition during the crystal growth process can be detected. This technique helps greatly the understanding of the relation between growth heating profile and chemical composition (RE-211 concentration) at different positions within the growing sample. A paper on the growth rate of YBCO system has been published and another on the effect of the presence of Y-211 on the crystal growth process has been submitted to the Journal of Crystal Growth. 
5. Recycling
A generic method for recycling failed (RE)BCO(Ag) bulk material into single grains has developed based on an infiltration growth technique by replenishing liquid phase lost during growth due to the effects of gravity. The success rate of this method on batch recycling is close to 90%. The superconducting properties of the recycled samples have been measured and to establish their potential for use in applications. 
6. Sample reinforcement
A shrink-fitting process has been developed to withstand the high interface pressure associated with the high magnetic field generated in single grain bulk material. As a result, the trapped field of GdBCO-Ag single grains can be measured without the samples failing mechanically when high field is applied at low temperature. This technique has led to a world record of trapped field in superconducting bulk materials of 17.6 T. A paper has been published in Superconductor Science and Technology. 
7. A two-step buffer-aid infiltration growth method;
This method allows the liquid phase to infiltrate to the Y-211 green body twice so that Y-211 particle concentration is under control first time. A trapped field of ~ 0.84 T (in a 25 mm diameter sample) is achieved at 77 K, which is the highest value in infiltration grown samples. Two papers have published and another paper is going to be submitted.
8. The buffer aid bridge seeding technique;
This seeding technique has been used to ensure the alignment of more than two seeds in large multi-seeded samples. Our research shows buffers act as pseudo hot seeds. Instead of cutting large bridge shaped seeds from single grain SmBCO sample to make bridge seeds, which is time consuming and not easy, lager buffers are used to replace bridges, due to that the buffers acted as hot seeding seeds. This technique is now used routinely to fabricate GdBCOAg 4-seeds seeded samples. 
9: The mechanisms of the multi-seeded growth: 
The factors that affect the growth of multi-seeded (RE)BCO single grains have been studied in detail for the first time. The resulting conclusions have been used to guide the growth of large (RE)BCO(Ag) single grains. 4-seeds-seeded GdBCOAg grains of up to 31 mm in diameter have achieved the same trapped field as that of single-seeded single grains. Two papers have been published based on this breakthrough.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The buffering technique will be used by other groups worldwide for improving the reliability of the seeding process. Buffer-aid bridge seeding will be used by the Cambridge group and attract others to develop a deeper understanding the grain boundary properties in multi-seeded samples. Multi-seeded quasi single grains have been fabricated successfully first time. This technique will be used to fabricate more samples to generate the levitation and attraction forces when large samples are required. One company in Hong Kong is interested in the strong attracting force generated by large single grains. Multi-seeded samples will be developed to produce such force. Bar-shaped, multi-seeded samples have attracted attention in Saudi Arabia (one of our collaborators) for use in tracks for magnetic levitation. Large, single grains and their superconducting properties have attracted attention within the modelling community. YBCO and GdBCO-Ag single grain samples have been provided to other groups free of charge to enable them to perform modelling and related experiments. Two papers have been published, and further collaboration is under way. This process has been used in recycling failed samples from Adelwitz Technologiezentrum GmbH (Germany) and is confirmed successful again. Large, single grains and their superconducting properties have also attracted attention from the applied community, and for application in linear synchronous motors, in particular, single grain, bulk GdBCO-Ag superconductors of diameter 20 mm, 30 mm and 40 mm have been used in such a device for the first time. One paper has been published based on the results of this study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9A73563F-B8A1-4DC2-9066-48985D0FAF7B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://bulk-sucon.eng.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
