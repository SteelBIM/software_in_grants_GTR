To do this, the network specifically sought to develop uptake and use of STFC central facilities (namely the Diamond Light Source (DLS); Central Laser Facility (CLF); ISIS; and the STFC Scientific Computing Department (SCD)) within the environmental radioactivity research community. The use of state-of-the-art techniques at these facilities would then provide much needed underpinning science to meet these grand challenges. Over the past 2.5 years the Env-Rad-Net has engaged the UK's research community to make a step change in the use of STFC facilities for environmental radioactivity research. This has included hosting and supporting network events; increasing the capability of STFC facilities to analyse radioactive samples; providing technique and safety training to 100+ researchers; funding projects to initiate new research at STFC and international facilities; bringing international best practice and experience to the UK; and engaging with industry/government agencies. These activities have catalysed the rapid development of environmental radioactivity research on STFC facilities. However, to maintain momentum, and further grow capability in this area, more work is needed. We seek to extend the Env-Rad-Net to ensure added value and provide a lasting legacy. We will do this by: (i) delivering a small research project scheme to further develop the community's size and expertise, and to continue building experience and capability at our associated STFC facilities, (ii) delivering / facilitating targeted networking and training activities that are designed to grow the network and enhance knowledge transfer (iii) working closely with STFC facility scientists and the National Nuclear Users Facility (NNUF) scheme, to inform and shape future large scale infrastructure developments at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) that are relevant to the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE EXTENDED NETWORK

1. Industry / Implementers

Site License Company's (SLC), Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and Radioactive Waste Management (RWM) Limited: Many SLC's are responsible for contaminated sites, UK Decommissioning and Radioactive Waste Management activities are overseen by the NDA. NDA-RWM Ltd. is responsible for implementing the geological disposal of UK Higher Activity Wastes, and they are currently developing the UK geodisposal safety case. Staff members from these bodies are part of the existing network and they are strongly supportive of the requested extension. During the Env-Rad-Net extension we will act to strengthen extant links, e.g. via RATE and through other networking activities, as this provides a ready path to impact and knowledge transfer (KT) in our 'grand challenge' research areas. 

National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL): NNL is a government owned, contractor-operated company. It is responsible for supporting the UK's strategic nuclear R&amp;amp;D and for developing specialised, high-level skills in the nuclear environmental sciences. Several NNL staff members have participated in the Env-Rad-Net and will maintain their activity in the extended network. Further, a key member of the NNL team (Dr Joe Small) will continue to serve on the Network's steering panel. 

2. Regulators

The Environment Agency is the regulator for radioactive waste discharges and disposals in England. It maintains a high level of interest in research and development related to environmental radioactivity and its impact and has links to the network. Network members also have policy links to geodisposal (DECC, CoRWM), new nuclear power (DECC and BIS), nuclear security (FERA) and nuclear incident response (GDS). Engagement will all of these bodies ensure two-way knowledge transfer and impact.

3. Wider public

Across the network, we have a strong track record in public engagement (see PTI). 

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE EXTENDED NETWORK?

1. Industry / Implementers

SLC's, NDA, NDA-RWM Ltd. and NNL will benefit from the enhanced capability, and knowledge generated by the network. Further, at a higher level the network will directly address issues affecting environment and energy, and more specifically will produce new research that can be used in underpinning management and implementation issues across the UK nuclear portfolio. In addition, the enhanced research capability within the community and at the STFC facilities developed by the network will provide a new and valuable capability for research undertaken or commissioned by these organisations. 

2. Regulators

The release of radionuclides from nuclear sites, nuclear security, and safe management of nuclear wastes and the subsequent mobility of radionuclides in the environment are subjects of intense public concern. At the same time, radioactivity spans the remit of many research councils and government departments. By consolidating the network between STFC facilities and the wider nuclear environmental science community, we will assist in developing a refreshed, highly capable research base in this area. It is clear that a healthy research base will provide capability in providing independent scrutiny in forward plans for geodisposal, low-level waste disposal, and for contaminated land and nuclear legacy management. This capability will be crucial in implementation of these significant managerial, technical and environmental challenges over the coming decades.

3. Wider Public

We will participate in outreach events to inform the public about research activities in this nationally important research area. These activities will contribute to informing the public about ongoing environmental radioactivity research in the UK, helping to enhance their knowledge base and contributing to the overall national discussion associated with the network's grand challenges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>400484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Actinides XAS 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A815B81-C59A-449B-9652-655076B27BA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>8th Workshop on Speciation, Techniques, and Facilities for Radioactive Materials at Synchrotron Light Sources. &amp;quot;Actinide XAS&amp;quot; is a series of unique international workshops, which focus on the basic- and applied research of radioactive materials using synchrotron-based techniques.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.envradnet.co.uk/anxas-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>242437</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Feasibility Studies in Energy Research 2017</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A675F04F-53A3-47CA-A59B-5DA4E26A0E88</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Triple containment cell of X-ray Adsorption Spectroscopy analysis of transuranic (e.g. Np) containing samples.
