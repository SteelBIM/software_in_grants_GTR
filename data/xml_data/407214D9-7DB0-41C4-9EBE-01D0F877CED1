However, when examining a potential intervention, the complexity of the implementation environment makes prediction of the resultant population level behaviour change difficult, with traditional research methods used for these purposes (such as regression analysis of randomised controlled trials) rendered infeasible.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project forms a case study on using alternative, inter-disciplinary, methods from the domain of complex systems, for understanding population level behaviour change. The case study aims to describe the character of alcohol consumption, at a population level, in Britain over the last thirty years and to identify causal and contingent explanations for some of the changes in that character.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will use exploratory data analysis methods across a suite of existing individual level datasets (such as the General Household Survey from 1978 to 2010) to construct a socio-demographic time series describing population level alcohol consumption. Two transitions in the time series will then be examined in detail through computer simulation of established theories from sociology and social psychology (for example, the theory of planned behaviour). &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Policies that aim to reduce the burden to society of alcohol-related harm are the focus of significant and sustained attention, both in the UK and internationally. The range of adverse social consequences of drinking is wide, covering health (where alcohol consumption is estimated to be responsible for 3.8% of global deaths), crime and anti-social behaviour, and reduced productivity. The most recent estimate for England placed the total annual economic burden at between &amp;pound;18.5b and &amp;pound;20b. At the same time, drinking is an integral part of life for many people, who may perceive both individual and societal benefits from the consumption of alcohol.
Current and planned policies being debated in the UK include: taxation and minimum unit pricing, stricter licensing regulations, and universal screening and brief intervention programmes. Policymakers are key beneficiaries of the research: at local levels (Licensing Authorities, Police Authorities, Directors of Public Health), national levels (Whitehall policy teams in the Cabinet Office, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Department for Education, Department of Health, and Home Office; and also the devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), and international levels (European Union, World Health Organisation). Those organisations seeking to influence policymaking are also beneficiaries (particularly arms-length and third sector organisations with public health advocacy roles: historically these have included Chief Medical Officers, Alcohol Concern, Institute of Alcohol Studies, Royal College of Physicians, British Liver Trust). A third set of beneficiaries will be those non-academic organisations performing alcohol policy appraisal (historically these have included the Institute for Fiscal Studies and RAND Corporation). Downstream beneficiaries of well-informed alcohol policy implementations are the public and employers, in terms of health, wellbeing, duced opportunity costs, and economic competitiveness.
The ability of macro-level policies to target population subgroups is important to policymakers, but existing models are based on coarse, pre-defined, age/sex categories. The research will provide a much finer-grained understanding of changes in drinking within subgroups, where the definitions of the subgroups emerge from the evidence. The availability of alcohol (e.g. hours of sale or number of outlets) is believed to be an important factor affecting consumption, but specific policies to regulate availability are yet to be proposed. The research will provide an indication of how availability policies can be designed effectively by identifying the causal pathways that produce changes in drinking behaviour. Policies that affect the pricing and promotion of alcohol are in the process of design and implementation in the UK, and are attracting significant international attention. However the model-based appraisals of policy effectiveness and net benefit that are important to policy decision-making (e.g. choosing the threshold for a minimum unit price) are measured relative to a purely hypothetical scenario of stationary drinking levels. The dynamic and predictive elements of the research aims to provide policymakers with at least short-term forecasting capability, enabling more accurate estimation of the 'do nothing' policy option and a more realistic reference point for net benefit calculations.
Whilst drinking behaviour has been selected as the test bed for the proposed methods development, the techniques that emerge - and the lessons that are learned - will be useful for policy appraisal work in other areas of behaviour change. With the World Health Organisation estimating that tobacco use, high blood glucose, physical inactivity and obesity are responsible for just over one quarter of total global deaths, the potential longer-term benefits of the research in related applications is substantial.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-24</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>173427</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration on Markov modelling of alcohol use transitions</gtr:description><gtr:id>FD487A83-81B5-4A5E-B410-B8C55ECC060E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Chapter in a report to the European Commission.

? Finding 1 - the use of multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) in combination with hierarchical clustering can be effective in identifying behavioural clusters in secondary data;
? Finding 2 - theory-based modelling, embedded within a microsimulation architecture, can reproduce population-level behaviour change over time with demonstrated short-range predictive capability.

The methodological findings were demonstrated within the context of alcohol consumption behaviours in the UK population over the period 1978-2010 (for Finding 1) and 2003-2010 (for Finding 2). The routes to impact so far have involved translation and extension of these findings:

? Route 1 - working with users to translate both findings to other areas of public policy in the UK;
? Route 2 - collaborating with users and world-leading researchers to extend the use and geographical reach of Finding 2.

Route 1:
The main types of user we have engaged with are analysts working in the UK Civil Service. Analysts operate within all of the major UK Government departments, other public bodies and also in the devolved Scottish and Welsh administrations. The main role of an analyst is to support policy and operational decision-making.

We used our network of contacts to raise awareness of the findings within the analyst community. Initial interest led to us being invited to engage with initiatives developed by the Government Economic and Social Research (GESR) Team within the Civil Service. The GESR Team is the professional support unit for the Government Social Research (GSR) and Government Economic Service networks, and also engages with a wider analytical audience including statisticians, operational researchers and psychologists. The evolving impact work we are doing is focused on support for Objective 4 - 'Building capability for all' - of the GSR Strategy 2015-2020; this objective seeks to promote professional development within the analyst community, particularly by providing development experiences for identified capability gaps and by facilitating knowledge sharing. 

By engaging with GESR we have achieved good reach within the analyst community - including engagement with users from eight government departments and agencies: Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), Department for Education, Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills, HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, Department for Environment, Food &amp;amp; Rural Affairs, Health and Safety Executive, UK Commission for Employment &amp;amp; Skills and Ministry of Justice. We have engaged with users at a variety of levels, including with the Chief Economist at DWP.

So far we have provided four seminars to different GESR audiences, aimed at knowledge sharing and capability development. The seminars were designed in collaboration with senior stakeholders and focused on tutorial-style guidance on the methods, together with 'good practice' and 'lessons learned' experiences of how the methods were selected, shaped and applied in the area of alcohol policy. The relevance of the approaches to wider policy areas was also emphasised.

The seminars are stimulating further engagement with analysts working on 'live' policy and operations questions within government. The methods in Finding 1 have supported a segmentation analysis of service users for one of the main benefits administered by DWP. Finding 1 has also raised awareness of the utility of MCA for analysis of categorical data - with DWP analysts now actively considering the approach as part of their toolbox when approaching a new problem.

We are continuing our engagement with GESR initiatives and will continue, via our network of contacts, to offer bespoke support to analysts working on live problems within government. Where such support requires more than informal consultancy, we have the opportunity to seek resource from the University of Sheffield's 'Impact, Innovation and Knowledge Exchange' account.

Route 2:
We have socialised Finding 2 through the engagement with GESR initiatives described earlier. Senior stakeholders in GESR perceive potential benefits from translation of Finding 2 to other areas of policy and operations; we worked with them to create a one-page summary of the approach and its benefits to be used in discussions within the organisation. The use of micro-simulation and agent-based modelling is an on-going subject of debate and discussion within the analyst community and we will continue to engage with this conversation in support of emerging impact.

To extend the geographical reach of Finding 2 we are collaborating with world-leading experts from North America (the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Canada, the Public Health Institute in California, and Johns Hopkins University in Maryland). Together we submitted a major proposal to the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to further develop the methodology of Finding 2 and to apply it to key alcohol policy questions in the US (both at national level and at state level). The proposal has been approved for funding by NIH but was not selected in the initial tranche of projects funded. The proposal remains available for funding until February 2017 and we are pro-actively seeking routes forward to secure a positive selection decision.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ECE52A17-9B97-4081-9DD7-B236E049EF6B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Theory-led, validated model of behaviour change:
We developed an agent-based model (ABM) of alcohol use, representing changes in drinking for the population of England between 2003 and 2009. The usefulness of ABMs is often criticized on the basis that the agents (usually representing individuals) are encoded with very crude mechanisms of behaviour change and the emergent outputs of the ABMs are not validated against empirical data. Our approach addressed both of these limitations. We used a theory-led approach to design the ABM behaviour change mechanisms - specifically, we used the Theory of Planned Behaviour to encode a causal relationship between drinking frequency and attitudes towards drinking, perceived norms about drinking, and perceived controls on drinking (including social roles such as caring for a child). To identify parameters for our model (e.g. the strength of the relationship between attitudes and behaviour) we needed to fuse together data from three separate sources held by the UK Data Archive: the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and the General Lifestyle Survey. Once our ABM was developed, we validated its ability to represent consumption change using another separate survey, the Health Survey for England. We found that, when initialized with data for 2003, our model was able to accurately predict annual consumption change as far as 2006.

The theoretical and methodological quality of the research was recognized in the award of the Ole-J&amp;oslash;rgen Skog Award for Early Career Scientist to project researcher Daniel Moyo at the 2014 Kettil Bruun Society conference. We created a summary 'one-pager' of our approach at the request of senior analysts in the UK Government. We also published our research process in the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation as a case study in good-practice agile software development for ABMs in a research setting.

Typology of heavier drinking styles:
We identified a typology of drinking styles for Great Britain, focusing on people whose alcohol use is at levels beyond the UK Government safe drinking guidelines. Using repeated cross-sectional data from the General Lifestyle Survey, 1978-2010, we applied clustering methods to identify and track distinct styles of heavier drinking over time. We found that the typology of heavier drinking styles was stable over the 30 year period, despite changes in the overall prevalence of heavier drinking - the latter being driven by a five-fold increase in the prevalence of a beer-abstention drinking style enacted by predominantly female drinkers. This research is published in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism.

Model of alcohol use transitions in adolescence and young adulthood:
We developed a Markov model of transitions between different levels of alcohol use, representing the drinking of young people in the Munich region of Germany between 1995 and 2005. Markov models are potentially important for cost-effectiveness analyses of alcohol interventions but their availability is highly limited. The transition probabilities in our model are adjusted for age, sex and socio-economic status - all key variables of interest to policymakers. This research is published in the journal Addiction.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have secured funding for a major project to continue the research themes in WP2 through to 2021. The project - known as CASCADE - is funded by the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) and is an international collaboration between researchers at four world-leading centres in alcohol studies and policy modelling - the Sheffield Alcohol Research Group at the University of Sheffield, UK, the Alcohol Research Group at the Public Health Institute in California, the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The project both extends the methods developed in the ESRC grant and also expands the reach of the research from a domestic context to support for alcohol policymaking in the US.

In terms of application of our ideas, we have engaged with UK Government analysts across a range of sectors who are interested in designing interventions that aim to change behaviours within particular groups in society. Our modelling approach - with its explicit representation of social action processes - has appeal because it provides a scientific basis for arguing why an intervention might work and provides a framework for data collection during pilot studies. Theory-led, validated models, based on generative mechanisms of action and interaction, are seen as having potential uses for policy appraisal and evaluation (including Impact Assessments). Our approach is currently being socialised within UK Government, with support from the Chief Analyst in the Department for Work and Pensions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2BAA2691-0B7F-457A-B49A-15CC8EE13093</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure
