Even a small hot water scalds can become infected, which can lead to a great increase in pain, delayed healing, increased scarring, and a greater time in treatment (including antibiotic usage and surgery). This not only undermines the outcome for patients, but also increases costs to the NHS related to treatment, but also patients, in terms of days off work, travel to hospital, and related loss of income. In rare cases infection can lead to death, particularly in large and deep burns and even in children with small burns, via complications such as toxic shock syndrome. 
 
Despite the importance of identifying infection, this currently remains a major challenge for clinicians. Much of the difficulty arises from the fact that the symptoms of infection in burn patients can be very difficult to distinguish from other symptoms arising from inflammatory response to the burn itself, as well as other illness such as cold, sore throat etc. Because of these challenges, the standard methods that clinicians use to diagnose infection under other conditions are of limited value in treating burns patients. The situation is further complicated by the fact that most wounds have normal background level of bacteria, which does not need to be treated unless bacteria reach a certain level at which they begin to cause harm. However, clinicians may wait ~3 days to confirm the presence of bacteria in a wound, but these tests do not distinguish between beginning background levels and those representative of infection. Collectively, these limitations can also lead to patients being 'over treated', resulting in over and unnecessary prescription of antibiotics, dressing changes (which are often painful and may increase the risk of scarring), and extended hospital stay. 

The dressing being developed in this research programme indicates critical bacterial infection within a burn wound without the need to remove it. The dressing will signal infection by a simple colour change, that occurs when clinically relevant bacteria in the wound reach a level at which treatment is necessary. This can be used by clinicians directly at the patients bedside to provide more accurate and more effective treatment. In doing so our technology would not only improve outcomes for patients, but also reduce NHS costs and unnecessary antibiotic use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>NEED:140,000 patients with burns attend English and Welsh A&amp;amp;Es every year. Infection, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries, is implicated in ~32% of associated complications. However, diagnosis of infection in burn patients is problematic, with standard indicators of little value and clinicians routinely waiting 3 days for confirmatory tests. This clinical bottleneck undermines patient care, clinical outcomes and contributes to the inappropriate use of antibiotics and over treatment as well as missed infection diagnosis. 
 
SOLUTION &amp;amp; RATIONALE: We have developed an infection responsive wound dressing which gives a clear visual indication of wound infection, directly at point-of-care. This technology responds to key cytotoxic virulence factors from predominant burn wound pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, (&amp;quot;SPE-group&amp;quot;; up to 80% of infections). Colour change is triggered at bacterial concentrations two orders of magnitude lower than their cytotoxicity threshold, providing early warning before major tissue damage can occur, whilst distinguishing invasive infection from low-level background colonisation. 

DEVELOPMENT PLAN: The research will be conducted in four distinct phases, linked by pivotal stop/go points (Fig. 3 and 8). Phase 1 will build upon our existing data and resources to drive the iterative development of dressings and an optimised prototype. Phase 2: i) Will determine toxicological profiles and compliance with ISO10993; ii) Clinical feasibility study (using wound swabs / exudates) to ensure performance is at least comparable to existing gold standard microbiological assays. Phase 3 will see completion of toxicology and clinical feasibility studies, followed by technology transfer (phase 4) and trials of scale-up manufacture and packaging at our industry partner Paul Hartmann AG. Ultimately this will deliver a product ready for production and full clinical testing.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>CLINICAL NEED 
There is a clear and unmet clinical need in burn wound care for tools that allow: i) Detection of infection at point of care (PoC); ii) Early diagnosis of infection to permit the most effective intervention; iii) Clear identification of wounds in which the Critical Colonization Threshold (CCT) of bacteria has been reached; iv) Differentiate between symptoms relating to wound infection and those due to injury-related inflammation. 
 
IMPACT and SCALE OF THE PROBLEM 
Over 140,000 people in England and Wales suffer burn injuries every year, with ~50,000 requiring treatment at specialised burn centres, and ~13,000 admitted to hospital. A major problem in the care of these patients is infection, to which patients with burn injuries are particularly vulnerable. An estimated 18% of burn patients acquire infection-related complications - a major cause of morbidity, mortality and increased cost of care. In addition to aggressive antibiotic therapy, treatment typically necessitates the removal of dressings, and sometimes further surgery. This significantly increases the probability of scarring and undermines clinical outcomes, resulting in a subsequent life-long psychological burden to the patient. Failure to treat patients in a timely manner also increases overall morbidity and mortality rates. Infection also greatly increases treatment costs with in patient stays costing ~&amp;pound;264.12 per day, dressing changes ~&amp;pound;250 per change, and surgical time at ~&amp;pound;500 per hour (Data from QVH &amp;amp; BRHC). 
 
Over management is believed to be a key clinical problem in these patients. Symptoms resulting from the normal immunological response to the burn injury itself are often similar to those encountered when infection is present, but are often present in the absence of infection. However, the seriousness of infection in burns patients forces clinicians to treat presumptively, often leading to over-treatment, and a significant level of inappropriate antibiotic usage. The comparaely high levels of antibiotics required to achieve inhibitory levels in the wound bed compound the latter, and promote the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) strains. 
 
Surveillance and diagnosis of infection is therefore a critical aspect of burn wound management. The capacity for clinicians to deliver this aspect of care has far-reaching implications for patient welfare, but is a significant challenge with currently available tools. At present, the diagnosis of infection in burns patients is impossible at PoC, with commonly used biomarkers of infection of limited value, and diagnosis predominantly based on subjective clinical judgement. Subsequent confirmatory tests (microbiological culture) to identify causative pathogens typically require several days, and do not distinguish between sub-clinical colonization and clinically relevant infection (see below). The WHO have highlighted that improved diagnostics are a key weapon in the fight against AMR.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>902285</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BBc One Show interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEEA219F-587B-420E-BD5A-97CB498B0B25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview on BBC 'The One Show' , 22 Jan 2016 regarding dressing development programme and problems of AMR</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.facebook.com/uniofbath/photos/a.442520340048.220589.128469715048/10153749908230049/?type=3&amp;theater</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guardian one page pice on wound dressing research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4A4FB71B-EC89-48CE-B701-4B6A18039395</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guardian interview and article on dressing dveelkopment and problem of AMR</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/20/colour-changing-dressing-to-fight-antibiotic-resistance</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Patent protects the vesicle release technology developed during this grant and now underpinning our current wound dressing development programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>06B6FFEA-F0CE-4210-943C-3159FFAABC83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In discssion with industry partners for upscaling and comemrcial development of technology</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Commercial In Confidence</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>US9499852B2</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Wound dressing</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:clinicalTrial>true</gtr:clinicalTrial><gtr:description>Laboratory observational Ex-Vivo study to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of a smart dressing to detect clinically relevant wound infection

Burn wound infections are difficult to diagnose, but may become serious if they are not treated quickly. To diagnose an infection, dressings need to be removed from the wound, which may slow the healing process. A new dressing Smartwound? may help to diagnose wound infection without needing to remove the dressing. The Smartwound? dressing changes colour in the presence of the infection-causing bacteria. Laboratory studies show that the dressing does change colour in the presence of bacteria, but before it can be used in patients, it needs to be tested with the bacteria found in human wounds. The new Smartwound? dressing will not be tested on patients in this study. Samples of burn wound fluid, called exudate, which can be taken from wound swabs and used wound dressings when the patients have their dressings removed will be used. Exudate will be gathered from patients with and without wound infection to see whether the dressing changes colour in the presence of the bacteria that cause a wound infection. Dressing changes and swabs are part of the normal care routine for patients with burns. This study aims to test whether the Smartwound? technology developed to detect infection in a dressing for burn wounds is effective in identifying infection.</gtr:description><gtr:id>767B11ED-5219-4312-8638-0A8931381964</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This trial will give key supportive data about the sensitivity and specificity of our diagnostic wound dressing, which will leverage next level of funding from industrial collaborators.
