Though formulated almost a century ago and since then thoroughly tested to an exquisite precision, the interpretation of its basic principles continues to excite controversy to this very date. For example, a puzzling consequence of them is that an object can be in a &amp;quot;quantum superposition&amp;quot; state in which it seems to be simultaneously in two distinct locations. Though such features have been borne out in detail in the microscopic realm, they certainly defy our everyday notions of physical reality which raises the question of how the classical &amp;quot;macroscopic&amp;quot; world around us emerges from this quantum weirdness. Over the last decades it has transpired that this quantum-to-classical transition of a macroscopic object, known as its &amp;quot;decoherence&amp;quot;, is effected by its unavoidable interaction with its surroundings.

In turn, recent years have witnessed a miniaturisation of mechanical cantilevers used for sensing applications. This has culminated in mechanical beams having atomic-sized cross-sections, made from a single sheet of carbon atoms rolled into a seamless cylinder to form a narrow tube known as a carbon nanotube. These behave essentially like sensitive springs and researchers are currently developing a variety of transducers to convert their oscillatory motion into an electrical or optical signal. Such transducers can then be used to manipulate these &amp;quot;nanosprings&amp;quot;, which given their small dimensions and high quality are also ideal candidates for studying the aforementioned intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics. For example researchers are trying to realise with them quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinguishable oscillation amplitudes. A configuration which often involves a similar superposition of the transducer itself. An important prerequisite for this goal is to understand what determines the intrinsic decoherence in these systems, i.e., what are the fundamental limits for the survival of their quantum superpositions.

To this effect, we will predict the intrinsic decoherence expected in a nanotube optical transducer. The latter is based on bound pairs of oppositely charged carriers within the nanotube known as excitons. These can be generated with light and their presence can distort the tube via electrical forces so that an indirect coupling is generated between the scattered light and the oscillations of the nanotube. In particular, we will elucidate the decoherence that arises from the fact that regarding the nanotube as a single ideal spring is an oversimplification. A more accurate description is to think of it as an elastic string containing innumerable harmonics, whose vibrations will all influence and disrupt the workings of the &amp;quot;exciton transducer&amp;quot; while we try to use it to bring the fundamental resonance into a quantum superposition. Within a quantum setting, vibrational energy is quantised and the elemental quanta of these harmonics are known as phonons, so that our focus will be the phonon-induced decoherence of nanotube excitons. In a first phase, we will consider this phenomenon in situations where one can ignore the finite length of the nanotube, and we will study how the phonons influence the properties of the scattered light. A second phase will focus on situations where the fact that the nanotube is suspended over a finite length and coupled to an underlying chip, plays a role. In particular, the nanotube's oscillations can be damped by being converted into elastic waves that are radiated into the chip that supports it, and this adds a further twist to the problem of how the exciton transducer decoheres.

Finally, beyond furthering our understanding of the basic fabric of reality, the resulting insights will impact on the usage of these systems as sensors at the single particle scale, and on a variety of quantum technologies that rely on exploiting quantum superpositions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project that brings together the fields of quantum photonics, optomechanics and nanomechanics, has the potential to enable the development of hybrid quantum devices based on mechanical systems. In this context, suspended single-walled carbon-nanotubes are emerging as a promising alternative for quantum nanophotonics that would allow to interconvert various types of qubits, and the present study of how excitons are affected by phonons in these systems is essential to achieve this goal. Such hybrid systems could then play a catalytic role in the implementation of quantum technologies, that is a current strategic priority in the UK's research policy given their relevance to the future of the ICT sector and concomitant economic potential, and the existing UK's strengths and capabilities in this emerging area. In addition the output of this research project would also further applications of carbon nanotubes as sensors at the molecular scale, e.g. in mass sensing or for magnetic resonance force microscopy at the single-spin level.

The aforementioned technological ramifications are expected to follow naturally from the more immediate academic impact that this crossdisciplinary research will have on the communities involved in optomechanics, carbon-based NEMS, quantum nanophotonics and quantum statistical mechanics. Indeed, the carbon-based nano-optomechanical systems to be studied furnish an enviable alternative for optomechanics and carbon-based NEMS, by combining the prime mechanical properties of carbon-nanotubes with the availability of quantum limited detection of photons. In turn, in the context of quantum statistical mechanics, one should highlight that this work would enable a tuneable physical realisation of a fundamental model, the subohmic spin-boson model, which is still lacking. The latter would contribute to the understanding of phenomena associated to quantum decoherence in the presence of strong interactions with the environment, such as dissipative quantum phase transitions. In addition, the possibility of varying in situ the carrier-phonon interaction is quite unique and, in the future, will lead to further studies of quantum quenches and nonequilibrium phase transitions. This deeper understanding of quantum dissipation in carbon-based nanostructures will in turn feed back positively on our ability to deliver quantum technologies based on them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder

mechanics is central to our current understanding of physical reality and has been tested to an exquisite precision. Nonetheless, the interpretation of its basic principles remains controversial since they challenge our everyday notions of physical reality. In this context, optomechanical systems are emerging as ideal candidates for fundamental studies of quantum physics. However, current schemes, based on radiation-pressure forces, are seriously limited by the smallness of the underlying interactions between single phonons and photons.

This project has analysed an alternative for optomechanical schemes based instead on the strong electron-phonon interactions featured by localised excitons in suspended carbon nanotubes. The proposed system realises an optical nanotransducer in which the deflection of the nanotube can be read out from the light scattered by a laser-driven excitonic transition that behaves as a quantum-emitter. It features single-photon optomechanical couplings that are two orders of magnitude larger than those present in cavity-optomechanical systems and, additionally, have the peculiar property that they can be switched-on and modulated using applied voltages. The project has lead to key results regarding two aspects of these carbon-nanotube systems: (i) the dephasing of the excitonic nanotransducer induced by soft nanotube phonons and (ii) the use of these nanotransducers to detect the energy quantization of a flexural mode of the nanotube.

To analyse (i) we have calculated the corresponding phonon-broadened fluorescence spectra under weak excitation for large suspended lengths. At low temperature this regime realises the &amp;quot;localised&amp;quot; phase of a subohmic spin-boson model with a spectral density scaling as the square root of the frequency. This is evidenced in the spectra by a collapse of the zero-phonon line that is in stark contrast to the usual Markovian pure-dephasing scenarios. We find that the characteristic energy scale for this phenomenon can lie in the micro-electron-volt range implying that for realistic parameters strong laser excitation could allow to tune across the corresponding &amp;quot;localised-delocalised&amp;quot; quantum-dissipative phase transition. Furthermore, the aforementioned electrical control may open up new avenues in the study of quantum phase transitions. Finally, we analyse the relative contributions to the absorption spectrum of coherent and incoherent photon scattering and find that their dependencies on the excitation frequency markedly differ from the customarily assumed Markovian case.

In the context of (ii), we note that current optomechanical schemes to probe mechanical energy quantization, which are based on radiation-pressure interactions, are seriously hampered by the aforementioned weakness of the single-photon optomechanical coupling. Additionally, such schemes are subject to a standard quantum limit that poses stringent conditions on their feasibility. Our proposed excitonic-nanotransducer alternative is based on a pair of localised exciton states, with sub-wavelength separation, equidistant from a node of the mechanical mode. Then, homodyne detection of the fluorescence effects a continuous quantum non-demolition measurement of the phonon number. The hurdle posed by the aforementioned standard quantum limit is circumvented by quantum interference effects in the spontaneous emission that suppress the quantum backaction. Interestingly, this allows for the observation of phonon jumps even when the linear exciton-resonator coupling is weaker than the emission rate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This theoretical project has led to outputs that will have a broad academic impact beyond the fields of optomechanics and nanomechanics, influencing the communities active in quantum nanophotonics and quantum statistical mechanics. In particular it has opened up a promising avenue for photonic realisations of non-equilibrium spin-boson physics that could lead to novel insights in quantum statistical mechanics. The subohmic spin-boson model has recently attracted much attention in the context of studies of the quantum-to-classical correspondence. This work paves the way to a realisation of this fundamental model which is still lacking. Furthermore, the possibility of modulating the exciton-phonon coupling is quite unique and will enable further studies of quantum quenches and non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions.

Beyond the aforementioned academic impact, the enhanced understanding of phonon-induced exciton decoherence in nanoscale systems that this research has provided will also benefit ongoing efforts to use them as quantum devices, which directly relate to current strategic plans to secure the future economic success of the UK in the niche of quantum technologies. Indeed, carbon nanotubes are emerging as a viable platform to transfer quantum bits between spins, photons and phonons. More generally, this type of quantum nano-optomechanical systems offer great promise for quantum applications. In particular, they could resolve a crucial issue in circuit-QED based quantum information processing: the inter-conversion between stationary microwave and optical flying qubits, necessary to realise a &amp;quot;quantum internet&amp;quot;. An enterprise with important ramifications for the Electronics and the Communication and Information Technologies sectors.

Additionally, in a broader context, the understanding of dissipative processes in nanomechanical systems, that this project has furthered, could contribute to their application as sensitive inertial sensors relevant to the Aerospace, Defence and Marine sector.

Finally, beyond scientific and technological benefits, a compelling demonstration of macroscopic quantum behaviour of a mechanical object is certain to reach out to the general public in a way that would address the societal challenges of fostering critical thought and attracting scientific vocations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ACF5164A-3A24-4925-B7ED-DCCC7E34486C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DD35B98C-4814-4883-BE47-3CC454725497"><gtr:id>DD35B98C-4814-4883-BE47-3CC454725497</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adiabatic elimination of Gaussian subsystems from quantum dynamics under continuous measurement</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physical Review A</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/29f1ce99116efdd558d030a38e12d48d"><gtr:id>29f1ce99116efdd558d030a38e12d48d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cernot?k O</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L020300/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C88380A2-9C65-425D-B4FB-4E289FACB800</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Atomic &amp; molecular physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>9CD2DA3B-F052-4076-95ED-10F46E76C382</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Optics, photonics &amp; lasers</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97B14C81-E082-430E-BC8F-733274083163</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Supercond, magn. &amp;quant.fluids</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7A2FF150-B3DF-4C8F-A44C-1EBF60BAFC60</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>70</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Condensed Matter Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8ECC9D35-20DE-4F19-8A8A-07D65859D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Light-Matter Interactions</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>22E04520-28AA-48BA-9263-1CFE1B162D16</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Quantum Optics &amp; Information</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
