&lt;p>A review of current trends, policy on and relating to sport, leisure and tourism, and the predominant position of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in public debate, indicated that the sector faced a number of challenges to build capacity, encourage engagement between business and higher education, and hence to secure the greatest (scholarly) legacy from the 2012 games and the various subsequent championships the UK has secured. The cross-cutting nature of the issues faced by the sector point to the importance of a holistic and wide-ranging social sciences approaches to addressing them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

Cycling in the UK is growing in popularity and a picture of increasing participation is starting to emerge. Evidence for this perceived increase can be found in greater media coverage, national sporting success, and reports such as the ?British Cycling Economy? which suggests that there was a net increase of 500,000 regular cyclists in 2010, with cycling being worth a total of 2.9 billion pounds to the UK economy in the same year (The British Cycling Economy, 2011). In addition to observed growth in participation, significant investment in new purpose-built off-road cycling facilities has taken place in the UK over the last decade. Despite rapid growth and significant investment taking place, the economic impact of developing off-road cycling facilities has received comparatively little attention within the academic literature. Of the few studies which do exist, notable works include Morey, Buchanan and Waldman, (2002); Fix and Loomis, (1998) and Siderelis and Moore, (1995). However, these examples focus on American developments rather than the UK context. As a result my CASE Studentship represents one of the first longitudinal studies to disaggregate spatially and sectorally how an investment in off-road cycling impacts on the tourism sector, and adds value as part of a regional tourism offer.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Uscreates</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Business Voucher 7: UsCreates</gtr:description><gtr:id>96D4440E-7EBB-489C-AA99-BF07C8CEDF66</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Co-creating behaviour change for travel and tourism: a scoping study



This business voucher aimed to explore new models of business development for social change agencies within the context of social marketing for the environment. Building on the expertise of the academic investigators and the interests of the client, the project sought to expose Uscreates to a range of approaches for developing new business practices and establishing new markets for behavioral change in travel and tourism. This was achieved by the hosting of a one day workshop at the University of Exeter?s Cornwall Campus, at which a range of other social marketing businesses were present, alongside key academic researchers from the University of Exeter and sustainable tourism providers from Cornwall. The day provided an opportunity for the client, represented by Rosie Head, to network with tourism businesses and establish the needs and potential market segments for business development. The event was jointly organized and also funded by the University of Exeter Business School and the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus. 

This led to the successful completion of an ESRC Follow-on Fund project from November 2011 to December 2012, the main output from which is a co-designed application for smartphone technologies that will market low carbon holiday travel to two key market segments in and around the London area. The relationship cemented through the business voucher has also led to a network of contacts being opened up to the academic investigators, including the developers of the smartphone application, Loco2. This company has expressed an interest in developing further knowledge exchange work with the University of Exeter in the field of low carbon travel and will utilize the community of practice established during the Follow-on funding period.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>VisitEngland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Business Placement1: VisitEngland (Fiona Hutchison)</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8A4A6F3-40E6-4B24-8C71-14063D0E87DB</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>The aim of this project was to conduct and disseminate a short piece of policy-focused research (with Business Voucher 8 ? also involving Fiona Hutchison) in conjunction with VisitEngland.

Through in-depth market research, this project assessed the desirability and feasibility of small-scale exercise consultancy businesses offering biomechanical analysis along with other services. Biomechanics is a discipline within sports and exercise science that enables human movement to be studied for the purposes of injury prevention, understanding human movement when injured and aiding rehabilitation from injury. A biomechanical screening can therefore provide clients with an understanding of their lower limb movement during running. This information can be used to a) identify differences between right and left side running actions; b) inform specific strength and flexibility training programmes to address an imbalance and help prevent against injury; and c) to help inform suggestions regarding shoe type associated with particular running styles.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>North Devon Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: North Devon County Council</gtr:description><gtr:id>A6ECE2E5-7B04-4C33-AE06-7D56B58F5FDE</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>A place in the country? The contribution of second homes to North Devon communities



This research is partnered and situated within the planning department at North Devon Council (NDC) and uses the framework of second homes to examine how UK planning?s statutory sustainable communities and localism agendas are realised. This research is looking at the impacts of potential permanent dwelling properties being used as second or holiday homes. The contributions second homes make to parish communities where they are found in high proportions in North Devon are reviewed through examining this specific and discrete form of tourism. This research originated from the 2008 Northern Peninsula Housing Market Assessment?s recognition of high proportions of second and holiday homes in North Devon and a corresponding lack of knowledge. It explores the nuanced influences of second homes as distinct and in comparison to holiday homes and how these influences at very local scale conflict and contribute to the sustainable communities agenda through assessing the socio-economic impact of second home ownership. The concepts and meanings of community and sustainable communities are explored from both community member and policy maker viewpoints. The research places particular focus on individual and community participation and examines the discursive ways planning policy is realised in place through local governance.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Active Devon</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: Active Devon</gtr:description><gtr:id>C68DA1CA-85A0-498A-A776-0E26EC3BCFE6</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Understanding the impact of the Devon Active Villages programme upon physical activity



Working in collaboration with Active Devon, this research project aims to evaluate the ?impact? of the Devon Active Villages programme by conducting a large postal survey study. ?Devon Active Villages? is a programme, developed by Active Devon, to support village communities to provide sustainable opportunities for sports and physical activity participation. The research survey measures physical activity behaviour, social-ecological correlates of physical activity, and awareness of the Devon Active Villages programme. 128 villages across Devon were randomised to receive the intervention within one of four phases. The research study followed a stepped wedge randomised trial design, where data was collected from all 128 villages in 5 waves (baseline, and after each of the 4 intervention phases). Power calculations revealed that in order to have 80% power, at least 10 responses would be needed from every village at each stage. Response rates have varied from 30.3-37.7% across the stages, with over 10,000 completed surveys returned so far. Multiple regression analyses and multi-level modelling will be used to analyse the longitudinal data. This study addresses the need for rigorous evaluations of physical activity interventions, and will thus have great impact on researchers, policy makers, and the wider community.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Helpful Holidays</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Business Voucher 6: Helpful Holidays</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBA2567D-DF57-45F9-BC8D-CAF251AFA1B9</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Helpful Holidays Future Marketing Needs Assessment</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Country Holidays for Inner City Kids (CHICKS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: CHICKS</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5EC7FFB-BAF6-4C21-9C98-6AB8AA1FD5F6</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Giving children the chance to be children: memory, identity and holidays in the countryside 



Young people?s leisure activities contribute to their social development and well being but the place of holidays in young people's lives tends to be overlooked by academics and policy-makers. This is especially the case among disadvantaged young people who, for various reasons, do not enjoy a period of childhood characterized by play, fun, enjoyment and freedom from responsibility in which they grow and learn in an environment where they are safe from stress and harm. Little is understood about how such young people experience a holiday away from the problems of their everyday life. CHICKS (Country Holidays for Inner City Kids) is a charity organisation that runs free respite breaks for disadvantaged children and young people. In this research, I seek to understand the beneficial and therapeutic effects of CHICKS holidays in the countryside for disadvantaged young people with respect to their senses of self, esteem, belonging and social inclusion. In this research I am exploring whether positive and happy memories help to sustain young people when they return to everyday life in the city. The research will contribute deeper understanding of the lifestyles of marginalized young people, their needs and aspirations. It will provide much needed information on the ways in which young people negotiate access to resources and spaces and engender a sense of place that enable them to pursue a chosen life-course.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Albert Memorial Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: Royal Albert Memorial Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>A289BD30-7DB7-4B69-B8A8-F6484937657B</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Socio-cultural Impacts of Museums for their Local Communities: The Case of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter



This project attempts to make a considered and comprehensive assessment of socio-cultural impact of a regional museum on its surrounding community. The RAMM has recently undergone a major re-development funded mainly by the local council and the Heritage Lottery Fund. As a result its main building was closed to visitors for four years, re-opening in December 2012. The project commenced with desk research to obtain an awareness of extant academic, practitioner and policy literature in the area of impact assessment for the cultural sector. Indicators of socio-cultural impacts were developed through a meta-synthesis exercise. Following this, a data collection strategy was designed which would relate to the research objectives and questions. The research involved a mixed methods approach to elicit views from residents of Exeter. Two large-scale surveys were undertaken, the first while RAMM was closed, and the second, following its re-opening. Lastly, follow-up interviews were undertaken. Quantitative data was analysed through SPSS, univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics. Cluster analysis and factor analysis were used to group together members of the community and to find themes in the variables related to impacts.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rugby Football Union RFU</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: Rugby Football Union)</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD5E4EA7-9B39-48F1-BF5D-631951097265</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Introducing children to rugby: retaining players and developing talent



Rugby is well-placed to contribute to the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) guidelines for reducing obesity through increasing childhood activity and participation. It has one of the largest participant bases of organised sports in England and is recognised as a sport for all ?shapes and sizes. However, the Rugby Football Union (RFU ) are concerned that the sport may be limiting its appeal to children because of the emphasis on contact and structured skill sets (such as scrums and line-outs) in the current rules of the game for young children. The RFU pilot project, Shaping the Game, trialled new rules for competitive games played between 7 and 11 years old. Empirical research using mixed methods compiled robust data on the implications of making these changes to the rules of the game. The attitudes of players and coaches were examined and on-pitch behaviours investigated comparing the trial rules with the current rules of the game. Under the trial rules the results suggested that there was significantly greater playing time with less waiting around and more involvement in ?play?. At under-9 and under-10 there were also significantly more examples of attacking behaviours, despite comparable defensive behaviours in games played.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Regional Educational Legacy in Arts and Youth Sport (RELAYS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: RELAYS</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEDD4EF1-519D-4C4C-ABC1-285A2620F5DF</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>This research collaboration enabled the exploration of the relationships between children?s physical activity, health and fitness through the use of a social marketing approach.

Visits to Artist Rooms on Tour



ARTIST ROOMS is a national collection of modern art which tours around public art galleries and museums and has a specific remit to engage young people with modern art. The research explores the experience of participants in projects funded ARTIST ROOMS, in which typically a small group of young people work with the gallery to create resources designed to engage the general population of young people. While a lot has been written about the possibilities and promise of (young) people working collaboratively to create public services, little research has been undertaken that gives a realistic account about what actually happens in collaborative projects. Therefore the research looks in depth, through two major and four complementary case studies, at the processes and experiences of young people in collaborative projects in museums and galleries. The research is largely open-ended and qualitative, using participant-observation, ARTIST ROOMS archives, audio-recordings of meetings and semi-structured interviews with both participants and staff. The research found that collaboration between young people and museums and galleries leads to positive experiences on both sides and to an innovative service for the wider public. However, there are also significant challenges, particularly within the tension between enabling a positive experience for the participants and creating valuable public services.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Meteorological Office UK</gtr:department><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: Met Office</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF7638E9-257B-42DD-86CF-A14D960F4B0F</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Dynamics of Communicating Climate Change Information



Climate change poses a significant challenge to communicators of this issue. The information on which climate change predictions are based is inevitably uncertain, and climate scientists and climate science communicators are motivated to communicate these uncertainties. Audiences, however, are more likely to be motivated by certainty when receiving information and deciding how to respond to climate change. Thus communicating uncertainty about climate change is likely to undermine audience responsiveness. Prior research shows high uncertainty, the use of probabilistic information, and the lack of specific action recommendations are likely to impair people?s ability to engage, interpret and respond effectively to messages about climate change. 

The broad aim of this PhD research is to examine the process of communicating climate change information. Attention is given to the collective role of the informer, information content and audiences in this process; and how these interact to produce joint effects on message understanding, trust and responses when communicating probabilistic climate science messages. 

These aims are being accomplished by using qualitative and quantitative research methodologies among various actors relevant to the communication process - including climate scientists and climate science communicators as transmitters of climate change information and the public as the recipients of climate change communication. By triangulating the research to explore questions from different sides of the communication process and using a mixed-methods approach, it is hoped that the research will provide a more complete understanding that connect to the specific concerns of those actors involved in this process (i.e. audiences and communicators alike).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Exmoor National Park Authority</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: Exmoor National Park Authority</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB30ADC6-EC3B-4C95-95CC-4EFFF4BF4422</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Perceptions of Exmoor National Park

The survey was conducted from 12 Feb to 4 March 2010, as an online questionnaire sent out to the South West Tourism (SWT)?s Tourism Industry Newsletter database and re-promoted by several Destination Management Organisations (DMOs). 240 responses were obtained.



Respondents were mainly from Cornwall (33%),Somerset (19%), Devon (12%) and Poole (19%). The majority of them are from the accommodation sector (71%).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Social Marketing Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: National Social Marketing Centre</gtr:description><gtr:id>637E0C7C-0696-4E5B-9C2F-CCC8D3FF6C11</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Social marketing: a destination-based approach to encouraging sustainable tourist behaviour



This research is focussed on utilising the principles of a social marketing methodology to encourage sustainable behaviour amongst tourists. Social marketing by definition is ?the systematic application of marketing alongside other concepts and techniques, to achieve specific behavioural goals for social good? (French &amp;amp; Blair-Stevens, 2007) Social marketing is a ?bottom up? process that seeks to uncover the barriers to and motivation for behaviour change. Social marketing has been successfully applied to health and social care settings and is increasingly being used to encourage sustainable behaviour however it has not applied specifically in a tourism destination. The South West of England has a vibrant and economically successful tourism industry worth over &amp;pound;9 billion annually and supports 11% of all employment in the region. However whilst the economic impact is highly valued this inevitably places a huge environmental and social strain on the region. Therefore this research seeks to, utilising a social marketing methodology, uncover the barriers and motivations to encouraging sustainable tourist behaviour in two case study areas in South West England (Minehead in West Somerset, Paignton in Devon). The research will also include the use of eco-logical footprinting software to explore the relationship between attitudes towards the environmental and environmental impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CASE Studentship: The National Trust</gtr:description><gtr:id>06DA3CBA-55A7-497C-A5EC-80A5818B6BAB</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Coast, Countryside, and the National Trust: Exploring Young Adults? Experiences of Nature though Sport



There is a need to better understand the reciprocal relationship shared between humans and the natural environment. Physical-culture studies have explored the existential destabilisation of mental and physical self experienced by fell runners as a pleasurable form of play. Whilst, engaging in an outdoors sport is thought to induce a sense of wonderment and connection to the natural environment. Yet, the implications of these associations upon well-being and environmental agency are not well understood. Environmental charities, like the National Trust, are particularly interested in such research. Knowledge in this area could inform how they interact with young active adults, from whom they feel estranged. This project, therefore, has two interconnected aims:

1. To examine the role of nature sports (climbing, surfing, trail running, and mountain biking) in fostering young adults? (18-30) sense of well-being and belonging relative to the natural environment. 

2. Understand if there is a mechanism by which this translates into an emotional connection to the work of environmental charities, specifically the National Trust.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hele Park Golf Club</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Business Voucher 3: Hele Golf Club</gtr:description><gtr:id>A310DDC6-1299-4B0B-B645-6FC67702F138</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Gaze Control Analysis to Train Golfers:



The importance of gaze control is being recognised in golf putting and as a result gaze training programmes are beginning to be used to improve putting performance. Through the application of existing expertise in the School of Sport and Health Sciences, the aims of the project were to: develop greater understanding about gaze analysis and training, and how they may be included long term in the business at Hele Park; and to trial the inclusion of gaze analysis and a bespoke gaze training programme as a part of the coaching service.

Outcomes included a peer reviewed article 'Quiet eye training facilitates competitive putting performance in elite golfers' published in Frontiers in Psychology, January 2011, Volume 2 and significant media attention featuring on e!

The ECB has acknowledged in recent years that a number of international players at near or world?s best have suffered from mental health problems ? in some cases cutting their international careers short. In response, the ECB are aiming to construct a psychological profiling system by drawing on the expertise of researchers to potentially screen for those who may be at potential risk in the future. From this, the ESRC studentship came together and now out research is contributing towards the profiling system. Our research in particular attempts to understand variations in a player?s adjustment and well-being within the training and performance environment. In particular, it is investigating the effects of multiple group memberships on psychological well-being and performance during programme transitions in elite cricket. Ultimately, it will look to provide implications for coaches and support staff alike to gain an in-depth understanding of their individual needs to aid, manage and guide a player?s transition, adjustment and well-being on the ECB programmes from under 16 years of age upwards, to help the function normally and perform excellently under the pressures of elite cricket.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tourism for All UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Business Voucher 9: Tourism for All</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1294607-AFAF-4598-9AC7-68DD0125F7C6</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Accessing Our Heritage</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>6) External Research Seminar: James Hutton Institute 2013 (Cheryl Willis)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>38C6B39C-A104-4822-886A-97B0A418A92A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cheryl was an invited speaker at a research seminar at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen where she joined a group of around 30 renowned researchers and associates to discuss the assessment and impact of cultural services.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>5) External Engagement: Instow Parish Council Meeting (Jenny Barnett)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F6493EE-15E8-49EC-B103-62CB3BD1249C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research was presented to Instow PC to facilitate their engagement with the project and answer any questions the community might have about the process.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>9) Lecture: Sustainable Tourism Management module (Tim Wilkinson)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>73F7FB6B-60CB-4773-820E-A608B9AC4E9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation entitled: &amp;quot;Marketing a national landscape: perceptions of Exmoor National Park and impact on the local tourism economy&amp;quot; to approx. 25 students on the Sustainable Tourism Management module (BEMM375) at the University of Exeter Business School.
