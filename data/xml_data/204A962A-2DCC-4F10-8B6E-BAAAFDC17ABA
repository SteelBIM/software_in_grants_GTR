Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K00333X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Although people are living longer than ever before, the number of people with dementia is increasing, and 1 in 5 people over 80 will have dementia by 2021. People with dementia and their families often become disconnected from society through the stigmatizing effect dementia has on taking part in everyday activities. Added to this, the current economic climate has meant reductions in many services, and there is often a lack of meaningful activity available to this population. Yet many people with dementia wish to remain within their communities, in the home of their choice, near their family, carers and friends, with the support of health and social care services. This research aims to address the disconnection and marginalisation of people with dementia and explore how the vision for dementia supportive communities might benefit from creative activities. Specifically, it will use a visual art intervention as the catalyst for change for understanding community connectivity, challenging attitudes and promoting well being. 
Research to date, although limited, suggests a number of potential benefits of arts participation to the quality of life, health and well-being of people with dementia. This project wishes to build on this to address a new area, which will maximise the involvement of, and potential benefit to communities. It will look at how participation in community arts interventions can increase well-being and connectedness between the dementia community and wider society. It will also examine another new area, to further understand the underlying processes that create the connection between arts participation and good outcomes.
 To realise the aims, the research will be set within three areas of the UK. These consist of ethnically and geographically diverse communities to contextualise the research. In each area our project partners will deliver the same visual arts intervention over a 12 month period to different groups. To understand the impact, the research will assess changes over time in the well-being and social connectedness of people with dementia, and how these changes can in turn have positive effects in communities (facilitate change in societal attitudes and promote participation and inclusion) through social contagion. The processes and outcomes of the research will be assessed using a range of quantitative and qualitative approaches, and will use art, both as a tool for analysis and for visual, creative representations of the results.

The research builds on existing relationships and develops new ones with community and policy partners, such as arts organisations, museums, galleries, health and social care practitioners, charities and local government. This will ensure full engagement and maximum benefit and impact for research, policy and practice. It will also contribute towards building future sustainability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research aims to demonstrate to central and local government, statutory and voluntary sector, health and social care providers, and community arts and cultural venues how they can contribute towards creating dementia supportive communities through visual arts as the catalyst for increasing connectivity, well-being and changing social representations of dementia. A strength of the proposed research is the range of potential beneficiaries (beyond academia) and the subsequent impact. Specifically:
Impact through informing national policy: Dementia is a national priority. This research will contribute to the ambitions for Dementia Supportive Communities (WAG, 2011a) and changing awareness and understanding about dementia, enabling people to 'live well' (National Dementia Strategy, DoH). Partnership with the Alzheimer's Society will provide a valuable link to government policy making. 
Impact to cultural policy: It is anticipated the research will make an important contribution to spending decisions within cultural policy, enabling cultural organisations, along with the wider arts and humanities community, to better evidence the impact cultural practice and research can have on communities, using the language and methods most closely associated with central government and Treasury's Green Book (HMT 2003, O'Brien 2010). 
Impact to the third sector and local authority policy and practice: The research will assist with spending decisions, by providing evidence of the benefits to people with dementia, their carers, and the communities in which they live. The economic value will be of particular relevance in these times of austerity. This will be of direct relevance to policy actions in local authority health, social care and well-being strategies. The robust programme of research will contribute to developing thinking between health and arts sectors that engagement with the arts can be seen as a valid part health care. Charities will be able to use findings for advocacy purposes. 
Impact to practice: The research consolidates existing theory and practice into the development of a new programme which will be robustly evaluated. The resulting output will be of high quality and thus of practical benefit to art practitioners and arts organisations, galleries and museums practitioners, the medical profession (including academics, GPs, medical students and care staff) and carers, who will benefit from understanding how to use art to improve quality of life. Understanding relationships within communities of practice will identify barriers and subsequent solutions to ensure maximum benefits to their work and those who receive their services. 
Impact to communities: Older people and the general public as future older citizens will benefit through improved societal awareness of the circumstances of cognitive impairment in later life and outputs will identify how older people manage to maintain social and community involvement. Understanding the benefits/barriers will improve wider participation and connectivity, and reduce social isolation for people with dementia and their families/carers. Challenging negative perceptions and attitudes towards people with dementia is anticipated through planned exhibitions. 
Impact through communication and dissemination: The research has drawn on some of the principles of implementation science to develop a knowledge transfer and communication strategy, which details organisations that will potentially benefit and mechanisms of engagement. The development work has established a national community of policy and practice, consisting of key stakeholders/organisations and people with dementia. Importantly they bridge and interconnect currently separate arts, dementia, health, social care &amp;amp; academic, policy &amp;amp; practice silos. Because they engage public, private &amp;amp; voluntary sector stakeholders, this may be beneficial in wider policy &amp;amp; practice arenas, maximise opportunities &amp;amp; minimise barriers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1219353</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Intervention artists Claire Ford and Kate Sweeney made a short audio visual poem titled 'The Cruel Sea' in response to conversations as part of an intervention session held in the care home.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F81176E-F2C6-4B9D-B481-B0C98DC6F8F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The poem has been added to the Connected Communities Dementia and Imagination page as a resource: http://connected-communities.org/index.php/project_resources/the-cruel-sea-dementia-and-imagination-film/

Almost 150 delegates attended the event, coming from a wide variety of backgrounds including: research, arts, policy and the third sector. 

The event was formally opened by Baroness Sally Greengross OBE, Co-Chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Dementia. 

Highlights included a keynote by Dr Gill Windle with preliminary and key results from the research including the Social return of Investment analysis and observation tool; Clive Parkinson with two presentations covering the artists and artistic outcomes from the research; a panel with two research participants and their relatives sharing their experience of the research as well as: numerous workshops by the intervention artists sharing and exploring their practice; installations of the research artist's findings; and presentations by members of the research team on aspects of the research including connectivity and social capital, impact for family members and staff carers, The Grand Tour (a discrete project within the research) dissemination and impact, and social return on investment. Several of the presentations have been made available on the project website: http://dementiaandimagination.org.uk/dementia-care/activities-and-events/

Feedback was collected on the day through a creative exercise and this will be looked at by the team.

3 presentations were given by Katherine Algar, Dr Catrin Hedd Jones and Teri Howson, chaired by Andrew Newman. The symposium endeavored to raise awareness of the research process and the methodological challenges of conducting research. 

Dr Catrin Hedd Jones discussed the challenges of engaging people living with dementia to attend a three month visual art programme and the methodology adopted to recruit people to the study. 

Kat Algar examined an art intervention from the perspective of participants with dementia, care staff, and the artists, with emphasis on the change in care home staff attitudes.

Teri Howson considered process versus outcome in a visual arts intervention and the difficultly of demonstrating process beyond the art session.

Events were held in The Hatton Gallery, Newcastle, Ruthin Craft Centre, North Wales, and Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester. Although the study had not begun analysing the data, the events were designed to open up conversations around visual art and dementia as well as engage with interested stakeholders. 

Each workshop introduced the study and provided hands on experience of kind of arts activities that have been delivered in care homes, NHS assessment units and community venues. In Newcastle and North Wales some of the carers, relatives and people with dementia who had attended the art groups for the research came to the workshops to provide their experience of taking part in an art group. This was highly valued by the attendees giving them direct insight into the effects of the group. 

Attendees also gave input into the Practitioner's Handbook which the research is developing suggesting formats when it is produced and what should be included.

The events were co-created with the artists and arts organisations (Equal Arts, Denbighshire County Council Arts Service and Nottingham Contemporary) who have partnered for the research.

Using postcards, feedback was collected at the start and end of the day and suggested a shift in responses in their views on dementia and the role of art.
A 3 months follow up with attendees provided information that some of the techniques that were demonstrated at the workshop had since been tried by Dementia Support Workers on NHS wards for their activities sessions. 

The format of the event was used for the Lifestyle Matters workshop event held in Bangor on 30th November alongside 3 other non-pharmacological activities to provide health and social care professionals with hands on experience of 4 activities for people living with dementia. 

This has also been taken on for the research with the successful award of an Impact Acceleration Award led by Dr Catrin Hedd Jones from the team, which will look to further develop and enhance this workshop to enable the research to be taken on board in practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://dementiaandimagination.org.uk/dementia-care/activities-and-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Follow up presentation to Alzheimer's Support group for wave 2 participants, 11th September 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B3C54A0C-4DF4-479A-B64A-FD265683B379</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Catrin Hedd Jones presented to the support group to show slides of the first group's work. 3 participant' for this wave were recruited through this group, and this allowed for their work to be shared with their peers.

The events involved participants from the research, including people living with dementia, professional carers and relatives. The North Wales activities brought in two school groups of year 5 and 6 pupils, who all attended a dementia friends awareness session before the event. 

The groups made creative responses to thinking about dementia-friendly futures, responding to the theme of Utopia for the 2016 festival. Their work was shared at the Utopia Fair in Somerset House, London in June and added to at those events. 

We collated a number of responses using our 'dementia is', 'art can' postcards and produced two Wordle's sharing the prominent messages from the responses. These can be viewed on the website.

Feedback from care home staff in the North East said the event had been 'informative and helpful', the 'stimulating' 'engaging' and 'creative' format of the day and with most feeling that it would inform their approach to activities for people with dementia in their care homes.

In addition, a film of the piece in North Wales was made, which came out of previous work created by the artist, Lisa Carter (see artistic outputs for full details).

The arts were embedded as:
? A socially engaging quality activity where we evaluate the benefit to well-being and quality of life (drawing on social science approaches).
? A tool to understand the experience of dementia, from the perspectives of those living with the condition and those who live with or care for them (drawing on social science and humanities approaches). 
? A method for creatively interpreting research, and engaging the public in conversations about living with dementia. 

In relation to the latter point, we have been at festivals such as the Green Man, and the International Eisteddfod - taking the topic of dementia to different audiences. We have had exhibitions, showcasing some of the work produced by people living with dementia, encouraging the public to see dementia differently - this is about what people CAN do, not what they can't. We have run workshops for artists, health and social care practitioners to come along and work with some of the artists and get a feel for how they might deliver such an activity in their own practice, meeting and working with some of the research participants living with dementia. Some of our artists held workshops with the public encouraging them to think about the idea of a 'dementia friendly community'. Our public engagement work has reached hundreds of people. If each of those people takes away just one new piece of understanding about living with dementia, and what they might be able to do differently in their places of work, or places where they live, that is a significant achievement.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EE1EC593-6E8D-41F8-9BEC-30B03B707328</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Using an experimental framework we examined the well-being of 125 people living with dementia when they were taking part in our visual arts activity and compared it with a social activity that did not involve art. Compared to the social activity - the visual art activity led to significantly higher scores for:
? Attention
? Pleasure
? Interest
? Self esteem
Compared to the social activity - the visual art activity led to significantly lower scores for: 
? Sadness
? Negative mood
So this suggests that the arts activity was better for aspects of well-being than just a social activity, especially useful for trying to demonstrate 'what might be so 'special' about the arts.

We also asked 146 carers to rate the quality of life of the person living with dementia who they cared for. Here we found that 'dementia quality of life' (measured by the DEMQOL, an established research tool for evaluating the quality of life of people living with dementia) improved significantly from baseline before the arts programme to time 2, just at the end suggesting that the art programme may have been beneficial. But this improvement was not sustained at Time 3, 6 months beyond the end of our 12 week art programme, when no art programme was being delivered. If we want that improvement seen here at the end of the programme to be sustained, we would suggest that art activities should be embedded within day to day life to maintain and well-being. 

Sixty-three people living with dementia were able to discuss in depth the experience of taking part in the visual arts activity. We analysed these narratives qualitatively using a method of thematic analysis. Most participants responded positively. In some cases, the art focus provided the main incentive to attend, for others the social aspect was more important, and a number perceived the benefits of both, making connections between the art and social aspects. The programme content was a stimulating experience, being a subject for conversation and learning more about other participants through discussion and art-making. &amp;quot;The group sucks you out of the abyss, lifted me out of depression&amp;quot;. (Female, living in private accommodation). Articulating the unique impact of the art activity was more challenging. Nevertheless, most respondents were able to express a sense of enjoyment and pleasure in taking part in the art programme, improving their well-being (such as improving their mood or emotional state), or, were able to describe and reflect on particular techniques they had most appreciated in the art group. Participants also identified that even if they did not perceive their own work as aesthetically pleasing, they conveyed pleasure in the process of engaging with making art, and many expressed pride in their sense of achievement. &amp;quot;Because my wrists have gone I can't do heavy carving so I have just gone along with it since I have been here but this new kind of art is interesting. I'm using it in my sense&amp;quot;. (Male, living in private accommodation). There was good recall of the activities. Some key factors influencing participation (accessing transport, the venue, poor health, stigma) are important considerations for future services regarding equity of access. &amp;quot;The follow on group started yesterday. I was a bit disappointed some could not get there due to the transport, it cost me &amp;pound;12 for a return taxi fare. I can get to [the follow on group], you need to go regularly&amp;quot;. (Female, living in private accommodation).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research suggests that art and cultural organisations and community venues are ideally situated for delivering high quality, socially inclusive, mentally stimulating activities. Currently in the UK the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend cognitive stimulation groups as a psychosocial treatment for people living with mild to moderate dementia. Cognitive stimulation may be a key aspect of the art programme described here, as there is congruence between the 'guiding principles' of cognitive stimulation, as described by Aguirre and colleagues (2011) and aspects of the arts programme. A possible future implementation pathway could be to consider an arts programme as a follow-on or perhaps an alternative to a conventional cognitive stimulation group. We have developed our visual arts programme as a 'practice guide' suggesting foundations for excellent practice. This is freely available from our website and we plan to develop this as training for artists to support further implementation.
