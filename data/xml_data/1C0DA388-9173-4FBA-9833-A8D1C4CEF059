This funding will support three seven-week field seasons of archaeological research at Songo Mnara, a Swahili stonetown on the southern coast of Tanzania, along with subsequent analysis of data recovered and dissemination of research results. Stonetowns, the quintessential expression of Swahili culture, are known along the eastern coast of Africa, and represent an important form of autochthonous urbanism that linked Africa with the Indian Ocean world system. A World Heritage Site, Songo 1vlnara is recognized as the most impressive of all Swahili townscapes and considered to be the quintessential expression of the coral-built tradition for which the coastal towns became famous. The town has a full range of domestic and non-domestic structures, with more than 40 coral-built houses and room-blocks, 5 mosques and multiple cemeteries. Occupation of the site was brieC li'otn the 14'&amp;quot; to 16'&amp;quot; centuries AD, coinciding with the golden age of Swahili stonctowns along the coast. Research at Songa .Mnara adopts a spatially-integrated approach to Swahili economic and ritual/religious practice that will allow us to isolate both deliberately-planned elements of the town (central cemeteries and open spaces) and elements that might have been created through exigency, particularly in the realm of domestic architecture.
The proposed fieldwork will explore the urban space of Songo Mnara at four interlinked scales:
(l) Household activities will be sought through systematic excavations within and around buildings at the site; 
(2) Public and communal practices will be recovered through geo archaeology, geophysical survey, and excavations across the open areas and monuments of the site; 
(3) The site plan will be accurately plotted; and 
(4) The site will be positioned within its broader landscape through off-site survey and geophysics. Analysis of recovered materials will take place first in the field, and then in the USA and UK over the periods between field seasons and in the year all the final field season. 
The project will be conducted in collaboration with local authorities and UNESCO partners, and accompanied by conservation efforts on the important coral architecture at the site; funding for this aspect is being sought separately.

Intellectual Merit
Research at Songo will contribute to discussions of urban planning in Swahili and other urban contexts. The exceptional preservation at Songo Mnara will allow for the construction of a robust dataset to explore the way that Swahili towns were both planned and unplanned, with their components altering an insight into the priorities and social negotiations of their inhabitants. 
This work will contribute substantially to discussions of organizational principles and levels of meaning in ancient town plans more generally, and especially to research on aspects of town layouts that were recursively linked to movement and activity. In this way, Swahili town plans offer a dramatic case study in which to break down the 'false dichotomy' between planned and organic, and explore the importance of spatial practice in the negotiation of global and local economic and religious practice.

Broader Impacts
This project will offer important training for American, British, and Tanzanian students, both graduate and undergraduate. The training of students from the University of Dares Salaam is significant, as it provides these students with hands on experience with up-to-date equipment and techniques. 
The preservation and conservation of Songo Mnara-which remains an &amp;quot;endangered&amp;quot; World Heritage Site-is a priority for the Tanzanian Department of Antiquities, who have invested in the site as a tourist destination. Archaeological research at the site also aligns with the interests of the local residents, who have an active village 'Ruins Committee' with which we will closely work. A long term commitment to archaeological research at the site will provide important educational opportunities to demonstrate the unique role that archaeology can play in its preservation and documentation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286093</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visits to site</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7C07927-5405-4788-B3F1-B1FA7CC23034</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We hold open days on site every field season, to allow school children from the local village to come and see the process and results of our work.

1. We have worked closely with the National Antiquities Service in Tanzania, providing training in archaeological method and interpretation. This in turn has fed into conservation policy at the site and in the region more broadly. We have also sought to influence conservation policy through active engagement with policy makers in the Tanzanian government. In general, we have worked to convince them of the value of below-ground remains, as well as the high profile standing ruins that previous conservation policies targeted. This has had a direct effect on national conservation policy, with a change in the way standing buildings are conserved and presented (without digging out archaeological deposits). We have also worked to engage local communities in this process, and used our contacts with local authorities to advocate for community involvement and community needs as part of conservation plans. This has actively affected the spending plan of an NGO working in the region (World Monuments Fund) who have now invested in community projects (a cistern, local school) in addition to money spent on conserving architectural heritage.
2. We have worked on education programmes with the local community, to teach them about their heritage and learn from them about their engagement with the past. This has included the school visit days incorporated into each field season, as well as community meetings for elders in the village and on site, and information leaflets in Swahili.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FEC7FAF5-9359-4DA7-82DB-CDE480476912</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Large-scale excavations at a Swahili stonetown of the 14th - 16th centuries CE have explored the uses of space across the townscape. This is completely new for the eastern African coast, where towns have previously only been explored very partially. It is the first study to explore how people lived in Swahili towns, exploring both economic aspects (crafts, agriculture and cultivation, stock keeping, distribution of trade goods) and also social factors (religion and ritual, privacy and exclusivity, monumentality and display). The results have surpassed our original intentions, which were to understand the structuring of space, and led to multiple insights into the social and spiritual life of a Swahili community in the past. In the process, the project has also pioneered and tested a new methodology for the recovery of contextual data in a past urban setting, with a level of detail known from only very few sites worldwide. The results can therefore be seen to include:
- Development of a systematic methodology for exploring urban space, using 'layering' of multiple data sets to create the fullest picture possible of past activity. The range of techniques used at the site include: off-site survey with shovel test pitting; on- and off-site geophysical survey; systematic shovel test pitting of open spaces; large-scale excavations of structures including exterior spaces; geochemical characterisation of all deposits; archaeobotanical and phytolith sampling by context; faunal analysis in context; excavation and analysis of graves (including human remains) and tombs; full excavation of four mosques; micromorphological analysis of sediments and building materials; detailed artefact analysis of ceramics, beads, metals, lithics; isotopic characterisation of human and animal bone; ceramic residue analysis of aspects of diet; laser scanning of standing structures. The results have been incorporated into a GIS database.
- Analysis of space in a series of houses built of both stone and of wattle and daub. Both have given evidence for a varied range of domestic activities, as well as ritual deposits laid into the foundations. Both also seem to have been the setting for craft activities of different kinds: spinning and possibly weaving in the stone houses, bead manufacture and possible cloth production in the wattle and daub houses. These have provided the scope to explore the houses as economic units, as well as claims to place in an urban setting. 
- Analysis of activities in the open spaces of the site, and around communal places like the wells, or monumental tombs. The result is a unique record of social priorities and practices in an urban landscape, accessed through traces of more ephemeral activities in the open areas, showing groves of trees, deliberately-maintained grassy expanses, and centres of activity such as wells and graveyards. Testing in the open spaces showed them also to be discontinuously occupied by ephemeral structures, some of which were later excavated.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings will be of interest to a range of scholars in the region and beyond. As discussed, a major contribution of this project has been the development of a comprehensive methodology for tackling urban space. This will be applicable elsewhere and is already being drawn upon by archaeologists elsewhere, most recently at Ribe in Denmark. By providing detail about past urban lives in eastern Africa, the research will also allow African examples to contribute to discussion about global urbanism. For example, a recent summary of understanding low-density urbanism bemoaned the lack of African examples; Songo Mnara could be a key example in that discussion, as we have demonstrated the range of ways that urban life incorporated agricultural and activity landscapes inside and outside the town walls. 
Regional scholars already draw on data from the excavations at Songo Mnara, and these will continue to reorient understandings of past society on the eastern African coast. This project has thrown ancient Swahili towns into relief, demonstrating the complex network of social, ritual and economic activities that made up the urban fabric and for the first time positioning international trade - the most-studied aspect of Swahili culture - into a context of local production, consumption, and internal power dynamics. Excavations have shown how stonehouses functioned as centres of production and commerce, how they were important claims to place and to permanence, and how the built townscape structured activity in and around the buildings and monuments. Importantly, they have also shown the local economic practices of fishing, farming and stock keeping in new perspective. Historians and archaeologists will thus be able to reconsider eastern Africa's position in global networks. For example, research at Songo Mnara has refined our understanding of the lack of markets in Swahili centres; this is not a function of a lack of commerce, but a pattern formed by the conduct of trade through the houses. This forces a reappraisal of the operation of global trade during the pre-colonial period.
In addition, the findings are reconfiguring understandings of Swahili architectural heritage. They are already being used by conservation organisations and the National Antiquities Service of Tanzania, to inform and shape their strategies for the site.
Finally, the site is being used as a pilot study for producing a GIS-based educational tool to be used across schools and universities in east Africa (funded by the British Academy). A companion smartphone app will be useful to tourists and help develop this resource at this World Heritage site.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC25D796-73D9-4E20-A653-987973698C5E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and
