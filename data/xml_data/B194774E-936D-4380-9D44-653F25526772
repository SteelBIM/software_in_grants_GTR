 &lt;li>SAGE includes gathers data on about older people?s past lives, including their parents? education and occupational status.

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This impact summary is intended to be read in conjunction with the detailed impact plan. Here we summarise the main audiences for the research and the nature of impacts to be achieved.

1. Intergovernmental policymaker engagement. Key divisions of the World Health Organisation (WHO) will be directly involved throughout the research process, from preliminary analysis to final dissemination. As well as influencing WHO, this will enhance our engagement with national health ministries and other organisations, as part of WHO's own dissemination and influencing networks. Members of other key organisations, including the World Bank and ILO, will participate in the advisory group. 

2. Engagement with national policymakers and other key stakeholders in the SAGE countries and elsewhere. Engagement with national key informants is a key element of the research design. Key informants will be kept informed about the project and will be invited to participate in national dissemination meetings. 

3. NGOs and civil society organisations, both nationally and internationally. HelpAge International will be involved throughout the research process and have agreed to support the dissemination activities, both through their international office and through their 70 affiliates in 50 countries.

4. The study will identify particular aspects of findings of potential interest to the general public and will develop specific strategies to communicate these, using press releases, blogs and media engagement.

5. The research will be of specific interest to DFID's interests in social protection, life course and non-communicable disease. PLS is currently seconded (40%) to DFID to support its research strategy in these areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98801</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fear and insecurity among older people: determinants and potentials consequences.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>362E88DD-9698-4B24-9D59-3167CF70AB31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was given at an Age UK ESRC Age UK Showcase.

With reference to older people in South Africa, we found pension receipt is not associated with enhanced health or quality of life. For hypertension, pension receipt was associated with higher awareness and use of treatment, but not with more effective management of the condition.

2) What are the main causes of varied rates of uncontrolled hypertension prevalence among older people in poorer countries? We found that poorer older people and those living in rural areas are sometimes less likely to be aware of their condition and effectively managing it than richer urban groups.

3) Does more access to education in childhood improve the wellbeing of women in poorer countries when they reach old age? We found some evidence for this effect in China, but less in other countries, indicating that the lifelong benefits of education are strongly affected by wider national development experiences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project will contribute to policy debates about cash transfers and human development. It provides key evidence that cash-transfers cannot enhance human development as a stand-alone intervention. It demonstrates a need for innovative, multi-sectoral interventions, such as the one we are now developing in South Africa and discussing with the national pension agency in Uganda.
The study demonstrates the importance of conditons like hypertension for poor older people in poor countries and the need not to exclude older people from Sustainable Development Targets related to premature mortality. The evidence it has collected will inform these debates and has already been deployed by a range of organisations, including the Inter-American Development Bank, HelpAge International and Age International.
The study provides detailed comparative evidence on pathways between widowhood and deprivation in later life for women in poor countries.
