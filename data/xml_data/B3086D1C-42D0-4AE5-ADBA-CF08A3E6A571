However, today's best aids fail to work well in many everyday situations. In particular, they fail in busy social situations where there are many competing speech sources; they fail if the speaker is too far from the listener and swamped by noise. We have identified an opportunity to solve this problem by building hearing aids that can 'see'. 

This ambitious project aims to develop a new generation of hearing aid technology that extracts speech from noise by using a camera to see what the talker is saying. The wearer of the device will be able to focus their hearing on a target talker and the device will filter out competing sound. This ability, which is beyond that of current technology, has the potential to improve the quality of life of the millions suffering from hearing loss (over 10m in the UK alone).

Our approach is consistent with normal hearing. Listeners naturally combine information from both their ears and eyes: we use our eyes to help us hear. When listening to speech, eyes follow the movements of the face and mouth and a sophisticated, multi-stage process uses this information to separate speech from the noise and fill in any gaps. Our hearing aid will act in much the same way. It will exploit visual information from a camera (e.g.using a Google Glass like system), and novel algorithms for intelligently combining audio and visual information, in order to improve speech quality and intelligibility in real-world noisy environments. 

The project is bringing together a critical mass of researchers with the complementary expertise necessary to make the audio-visual hearing-aid possible. The project will combine new contrasting approaches to audio-visual speech enhancement that have been developed by the Cognitive Computing group at Stirling and the Speech and Hearing Group at Sheffield. The Stirling approach uses the visual signal to filter out noise; whereas the Sheffield approach uses the visual signal to fill in 'gaps' in the speech. The vision processing needed to track a speaker's lip and face movement will use a revolutionary 'bar code' representation developed by the Psychology Division at Stirling. The MRC Institute of Hearing Research (IHR) will provide the expertise needed to evaluate the approach on real hearing loss sufferers. Phonak AG, a leading international hearing aid manufacturer, will provide the advice and guidance necessary to maximise potential for industrial impact.

The project has been designed as a series of four workpackages that consider the key research challenges related to each component of the device's design. These questions have been identified by preliminary work at Sheffield and Stirling. Among the challenges are developing improved techniques for visually-driven audio-analysis; designing better metrics for weighting audio and visual evidence; developing techniques for optimally combining the noise-filtering and gap-filling approaches. A further key challenge is that, for a hearing aid to be effective, the processing cannot delay the signal by more than 10ms. 

In the final year of the project a full integrated, software prototype will be clinically evaluated using listening tests with hearing-impaired volunteers in a range of modern noisy reverberant environments. Evaluation will use a new purpose-built speech corpus that will be designed specifically for testing this new class of multimodal device. The project's clinical research partner, the Scottish Section of MRC IHR, will provide advice on the experimental design and analysis aspects throughout the trials. Industry leader Phonak AG will provide advice and technical support for benchmarking real-time hearing devices. The final clinically-tested prototype will be made available to the whole hearing community as a testbed for further research, development, evaluation and benchmarking.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This mufti-disciplinary project has been designed to have impact beyond the academic environment:

*Sufferers of hearing loss*

The aim of the proposal is to demonstrate a totally new class of hearing device that, by using visual input, is able to deliver an unparalleled level of speech intelligibility in noisy situations where current audio-only hearing aids are known to fail. The proposal, by supplying the enabling research for this technology, has potential for significant long term societal impact. Reduced ability to understand speech in noise is one of the most debilitating symptoms of hearing loss. An effective hearing device would improve the quality of life of millions of hearing loss suffers (over 10m in the UK alone [1], receiving around &amp;pound;300M of treatment from the NHS annually [2]). Notably even mild age-related hearing loss (something which effects us all) can cause speech to become hard to understand in situations where many people are speaking at the same time (e.g., social gatherings); or where speech is heard from a distance and degraded by reverberation (e.g., classrooms). Even a small improvement in performance could be the difference that allows someone to continue in their job (e.g., a teacher in a noisy classroom) or to remain socially active, avoiding potential isolation and depression. Note that as the device will work by complementing the visual processing performed routinely in speech perception, it will be of particular benefit to hearing loss suffers who are also visually impaired.

*The hearing aid industry*

A new class of audio-visual (AV) hearing aid would have impact on the hearing aid industry itself: demand for AV aids would rapidly displace inferior audio-only devices. There are clear precedents for hearing science rapidly transforming hearing technology, e.g., multiple microphone processing and frequency compression have been commercialised to great effect. We foresee AV processing as the next step forward. Previous barriers to V processing are falling: reliable wireless technology frees the computation from having to be performed on the device itself; wearable computing devices are becoming sufficiently powerful to perform real-time face tracking and feature extraction. AV aids will also impact on industry standards for hearing aid evaluation and clinical standards for hearing loss assessment. Plans for realising these industrial impacts (including through an International Workshop, AV hearing device Challenge/Competition and open-source dissemination) are detailed in the Pathways to Impact document.

*Applications beyond hearing aids*

The project has potential impact in other speech processing applications, including,

-Cochlear implants (CI). CI users have even more severe problems coping with noise. With further research the technologies we are proposing could be used directly in CI signal processing. 

-Telecommunications. Here we imagine video signals captured at the transmission-end being used to filter and enhance acoustic signals arriving at the receiver-end. Note, this could be useful either in teleconferencing, or built into conventional audio-only receivers, or for people with visual impairment who are unable to see visual cues directly.

-Speech-enhancement for normal hearing. AV speech intelligibility enhancement may be useful for users with no hearing loss in certain situations, e.g., in situations where ear defenders are being worn - factories, emergency response, military, etc.
