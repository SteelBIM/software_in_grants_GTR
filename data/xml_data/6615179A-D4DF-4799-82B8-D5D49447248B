(CECAN)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N012550/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Contributing to the design of public policy that can respond to the problems facing society is challenging. Not only are policies difficult to design well, but it can also often be difficult to know whether the policy was successful. Evaluating whether changes have been caused by the policy or for other reasons can be hard to determine. Policy planning and evaluation are especially challenging when social and environmental problems are intertwined. For example, designing and evaluating a policy on the risk of flooding needs close liaison with experts, local authorities and citizens on issues such as coastal erosion, drainage, farming, housing, transport - and the policy needs to be both flexible and robust across these areas. Complex problems require new solutions with special kinds of methods and approaches to study them.

But how do we design policies that can keep up with environmental and social issues that are fundamentally dynamic? How do we evaluate whether a policy has been effective when the policy has been deliberately designed to adapt over time? What kinds of new methods do we need to be able to design and evaluate complex policies that cross sectors? How do we act quickly to respond to changing policy problems? How do we bring together and mobilise expertise across many different subject areas to work on a common problem and produce new solutions? How can we ensure that policymakers, evaluators, practitioners and students have the skills to design and evaluate policies that need constant updating? These are some of the questions this new Centre will begin to answer.

To do this, the Centre will foster an 'open research' culture of knowledge exchange founded on a growing network of policy-makers, practitioners and researchers. At its core is a strong group of academic and non-academic experts with many years' experience of working on these kinds of problems. The Centre is uniquely positioned to address some of the big policy challenges because:
* each member of the core Centre team is a global figure in their particular research area, has worked with or for policy makers or in policy relevant areas, and is a methodological pioneer who in his or her own way has contributed and created cutting-edge methodological approaches to understanding these complex problems;
* supplementing the core Centre team, a network of academic and non-academic Fellows and Associates will join the Centre for weeks or months. They will offer expert advice on areas that need specialist input for particular policy initiatives and innovations.

The Centre's work will include developing new and enhancing existing methods for the evaluation of policies in complex settings; piloting these methods on a range of evaluation projects; organising educational programmes for practitioners, academics and policymakers; and publishing guides and toolkits for evaluators, those commissioning evaluations, and policy audiences.

In the first year, we will:
* Link to on-going and forthcoming policy evaluations, so that we can advise on more advanced or cost-effective
approaches that might be used.
* Organise workshops that bring together evidence teams, policy makers and academics to work with us to understand the policy challenge and develop new ways to frame policy evaluation problems;
* Host cross-sectoral seminars on the state of the art of evaluating complexity;
* Initiate training events for evaluation commissioners, practitioners and academics to disseminate emerging lessons quickly;
* Publish short summary and agenda setting briefings on policy design and evaluation in complex settings;
* Publish a guide to what a complexity-sensitive evaluation toolkit might look like. This will become a 'living document', updated as knowledge develops.

Overall, this new and exciting Centre will enable the integration of a complex systems approach into the policy evaluation process and hence contribute to more effective policy-making.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE CENTRE'S WORK?

The key users of the Centre's outputs will be policy analysts, policy professionals, regulators and evaluation practitioners both within and outside government. These users are well versed in the Magenta Book, its evaluation approaches and their limitations. During discussions held for this proposal, they indicated that they want to know how to go beyond the Magenta Book to address pressing and complex policy evaluation challenges. These users are located in government departments and agencies, local partnerships (such as local enterprise partnerships and nature partnerships), local authorities, and third sector and commercial consultancy organisations. 

The primary beneficiaries will be those working in the policy process - in policy analysis, development and implementation - in relation to Energy-Environment-Food Nexus domains. However, the work will be of relevance and interest far beyond this, since they interface with a multitude of other complex global problems, e.g. health, inequalities, education and international development. The methodological advances made by the Centre will also be of interest to a wider academic and practitioner community in the UK, Europe and globally as well as business, consultancy and civil society organisations who operate within the Nexus and beyond. 

The ultimate beneficiary of the Centre's work will be the public and society through improved and more cost-effective policymaking. 

WHAT IMPACTS WILL THE CENTRE GENERATE?

The Centre will deliver instrumental, conceptual and capacity building impacts for economy and society.

The main instrumental impact of the Centre will be to enable better evaluation, evidence, policy-making and understanding of 'what works' - whether in public policy, business, or the third sector across the Nexus.

Better policy design and implementation will deliver benefits to stakeholders, the general public and the environment, delivering improved value for money for the taxpayer, a better environment for businesses to thrive and grow, and enhanced individual experiences of the environment, with potential for improved health and well-being.

The Centre will strengthen the links between policy-makers, evaluation practitioners and academia. This will enhance the ability of government to draw on expert resources and increase the understanding of government evidence and evaluation needs in academia and consultancy. 

The conceptual impact of the Centre will be the development and availability of novel and tested evaluation methods suited to complex settings. The Centre will also develop and shape the framings of issues associated with complexity in the Nexus, providing value, clarity and insight to policy generalists and specialists and wider beneficiaries alike.

The Centre will improve the capacity of policy-makers to conduct, commission and use evaluations in complex settings through awareness raising, development of knowledge and provision of tools. Similarly, capacity building amongst evaluation practitioners will enhance their ability to provide advanced evaluation skills and methods to government and other users. 

The development of this evaluation capacity will enhance the standing of the UK internationally and also create opportunities for evaluation practitioners to access and be competitive in international markets with consequent economic benefits and impact for the UK. 

The academic impact of the Centre will include the development of new knowledge and methods for policy evaluation, the building of a broad research community working in this area, the promotion of interdisciplinary working between diverse areas, the possibility of new approaches that go beyond the sum of their parts and the development of the research and policy engagement skills of those involved in the Centre over a wide range of stages of their careers. These will enhance the reputation of UK academia internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2482261</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESRC/NCRM Research Methods Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D2EF597-E4F7-4224-99CD-2DD133813C42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Emma Uprichard of the University of Warwick, organised and presented a session on 'Complexity and Method' at the ESRC/NCRM Research Methods Festival.

Through a mixture of plenary and break-out sessions, we discussed the difficulties currently faced by policymakers in evaluating complex social policies, explored the various tools and methodologies CECAN will use to try and overcome these difficulties, and came up with a range of 'real world' Nexus based problems that our co-funders wish us to work upon.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/events/10th-11th-march-2016-cecan-kick-off-meeting</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>18th July 2016, CECAN Seminar Series #2. &quot;Policy Making Using Modelling in a Complex World&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC5BADED-D615-4973-86D9-4F29ED435B05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The consequences of complexity in the real world are discussed together with some meaningful ways of understanding and managing such situations. The implications of such complexity are that many social systems are fundamentally unpredictable by nature, especially when in the presence of structural change (transitions). This implies consequences for the way we model, but also for the way models are used in the policy process.

We discuss the problems arising from a too narrow focus on quantification in managing complex systems, in particular those of optimisation. We criticise some of the approaches that ignore these difficulties and pretend to approximately forecast using the impact of policy options using over-simple models. However, lack of predictability does not automatically imply a lack of managerial possibilities. We will discuss how some insights and tools from &amp;quot;Complexity Science&amp;quot; can help with such management. Managing complex systems requires a good understanding of the dynamics of the system in question - to know, before they occur, some of the real possibilities that might occur and be ready so they can be reacted to as responsively as possible. Agent based simulation will be discussed as a tool that is suitable for this task, especially in conjunction with model-informed data visualisation.

Why? Because it does not consider the complex elements of peoples' everyday lives.
Of course, e-health technologies have not changed the world, as highlighted by Tony Blair's 'National Programme for IT'. This &amp;pound;12.8billion programme was meant to improve transparency, efficiency and accountability within the health service. It didn't happen and this became a paradigm case of inflated hopes and underestimated challenges in e-health. Trish was involved in evaluating the programme and fears that Jeremy Hunt is now going down a similar route, with a recent headline of '&amp;pound;4billion NHS tech investment', suggesting the same lack of attention is being paid to the system elements in evaluation.
Trish described the research she has been carrying out into 'smart homes' including e-health technologies for health, wellness and assisted living. She was quick to point out that in reality nobody lives in a smart home or has room for social assistance robots and the biggest determinant of an individual's health remains their social position, with poverty, poor housing, unsafe streets, ethnicity/culture, low health literacy, social exclusion and digital exclusion being additional contributory factors.
So, the vision of e-health does not match up with reality.
Through the case study of the 'Whole Systems Demonstrator Programme', a multi-million pound randomised control trial of telehealth and telecare, Trish explained how evaluations of such trials were biased because they could never capture the 'whole' system of influences on individuals' lives. She also explained that Government were quick to use very early data in order to 'demonstrate' the positive outcomes of the programme before the scientists had finished evaluating and analysing. Scientists eventually produced a very different picture to that which had been made public highlighting the struggle of conducting randomised control trials that are politically driven.
Trish suggests that RCT evidence is of limited value in e-health research, because 'today's trial relates to yesterday's technology'. Technologies are becoming cheaper and faster all the time. Also, neither people nor technologies can be meaningfully studied in isolation from the socio-technical system in which they are embedded.
She also discussed the importance of case studies in social research, suggesting a social science discipline that lacks in-depth case studies is impoverished because we need detailed narratives of what happened and why.
Trish talked us through various models of evaluation including those of Professor Saville Kushner and Professor Barry Macdonald, and suggested we need more democratic (deliberative) evaluation, where we critically question what is going on, who is not being heard, where are the hidden agendas.
Despite the fact that funding panels seem intent on recruiting more RCTs, Trish suggests RCTs reduce complex questions to over simplified scientific questions, particularly the question of 'what works.'
Trish summarised her seminar by suggesting that:

 E-health research is dominated by a na&amp;iuml;ve, modernist mindset that envisages a rational technological utopia.
 The RCT, borrowed from drug experiments and promising simple answers about 'what works', aligns with this vision and is strongly favoured by funders.
 E-health programmes are complex, multifaceted and politically situated, they fail chiefly because no one fully understands what's going on.
 In depth case studies offer rich understanding but such approaches are misunderstood.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/news/cecan-seminar-complexity-power-and-evidence-uk-healthcare-sector-a-case-study-of-e-health</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Relating societal expectation structures and opinion dynamics to actual policies and developments in facts and figures - How the discourses around New and Emerging Technologies (NEST) and Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) shape the European agenda</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AE18698D-E011-4C5F-850C-F0A3392B594A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Petra gave a talk at this conference on behalf of CECAN - &amp;quot;Identification, location and temporal evolution of topics.

Nonetheless, Andrew Darnton and Andrew Harrison boldly produced an engaging and thought provoking complexity seminar in Whitehall and we thank them wholeheartedly for a superb event. The seminar topic was 'Revaluation: Measuring Paradigm Shift'. 'Revaluation', a new innovative method for measuring change in complex systems, was presented and discussed. Revaluation comes out of a year's work evaluating 'bottom-up' change within the NHS. It is an approach based on participative methods, in which evaluators and evaluated are equal actors in a system of measurement, designed to reveal the 'full value' of the change intervention or movement. Since its evolution in the 'messy' system of the NHS, Revaluation has been applied to the challenge of tackling biodiversity, and to repositioning the public arts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/news/cecan-seminar-revaluation-measuring-paradigm-shift</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Candice presented CECAN overview at 'Realist Evaluators in Government' meeting - 7th July</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9EED66A7-55A5-43BB-812D-9BA6AE54D753</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Candice Howarth presented CECAN overview at 'Realist Evaluators in Government' meeting - 7th July</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CECAN presentation to Scottish Government</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BB31902-0A83-49F7-8A12-077D28B5C30D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ian Christie giving presentation to Scottish Government's climate/environment team in their Climate Week programme on 21st September.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote on 'Big Data, Complexity and Policy'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32A5D799-52D8-4B47-86F8-73EAB63B5BB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Emma Uprichard, University of Warwick, gave a keynote on 'Big Data, Complexity and Policy'.

Our aim for the workshop is to collectively generate deeper and shared understanding around complexity and evaluation whilst producing concrete outputs. In particular the co-construction of a general-purpose timeline for approaching evaluation in complex contexts. This will be designed to bring together your expertise and practical experience with our tools and approaches, to produce a workable, yet innovative, real world method.

We will combine participatory design and collaborative problem solving with information and ideas exchange between CECAN and partners. We will pool the diverse expertise of everyone present to collectively frame and make progress on the key issues, whilst learning from each other, introducing novel approaches and connecting them to the realities of evaluation in a variety of contexts. Sessions will be designed to: scope the problem areas, practicalities and resources and tools at our disposal; make connections and develop ideas to find routes for progress; and co-develop a practical output constructed and illustrated using real-world evaluation examples.

Sessions will include:

 Micro-presentations on innovative tools, approaches and case studies of evaluation of complexity in practice.

 Considering real examples and case studies-where is the complexity?

 Scoping the evaluation landscape and surveying the practical challenges and capacity to innovate.

 Framing and developing the key issues for evaluation of complexity via participant-driven, self-organised discussion.

 Problem-solving surgeries for specific issues, matching tools and problems and action planning in light of &amp;quot;landscape&amp;quot;. 

 Structured co-design of evaluation timeline.

He also highlighted the fact that even in a medical environment there was an acute need for evidence, in both medicine and policy spheres.
Peter then took the audience through a series of case studies to help explain micro-simulations (computer models that look like society) and how these techniques allow social scientists and policy analysts to ask the necessary counterfactuals.
He feels micro-simulation is under-developed and under-intellectualised, especially because many projects involving these techniques close without models or data being replicated and made accessible, instead they are hidden within bureaucratically protected silos.
He suggests the greatest use of simulation techniques are in representing social processes (e.g. pension schemes, life course, tax and employment policies), as they are based on real data and real people, and they can represent transitions at the level of individuals. Computer models can also be projected forward or parameters altered to test new scenarios, so you can pursue a policy idea which you couldn't do in the real world, helping envisage what the world would look like in terms of a specific policy framework.
The greatest challenge it seems, according to Peter, is to get better access to archived models and data from past research, policies and evaluations.
He stresses the need to be talking more openly with each other (researchers and government departments), and poses the question of how best to do this.
Thankfully that is part of CECAN's remit and we thank Peter for raising the profile of this challenge!

Since the inception of the USEPA, considerable emphasis has been placed on the use of policy analysis tools that aim to prospectively inform environmental policy decisions, including cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment used for regulatory actions. However, compared to the amount of such ex ante analysis conducted at the USEPA before a decision is reached, relatively little evaluation of these same environmental policies is produced after implementation to inform future policy development or to modify existing policies. 

This original research applies accountability theory and organizational learning literature in order to identify and explain unique institutional factors that affect USEPA evaluation supply to inform future efforts. 

Through a series of mixed methods case studies, this research seeks to inform efforts aimed at improving the quality of environmental evidence within the USEPA-through evaluation and systematic reviews-in order to better inform decision-making and achieve desired environmental outcomes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/events/improving-environmental-evidence-barriers-and-facilitators-of-evaluation-capacity-at-us</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy Evaluation For A Complex World</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37727A0E-641E-48E3-96B3-9EEB3858816B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CECAN: Policy Evaluation For A Complex World

St Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London
13:30pm onwards, Tuesday 13th September 2016

You are warmly invited by Prof. Nigel Gilbert, Director of CECAN, to an afternoon to consider Policy Evaluation For A Complex World.

Introduced by Jane Elliott (Chief Executive, ESRC), with a keynote speech from Sir Mark Walport (Government Chief Scientific Adviser) and a panel discussion chaired by Roger Highfield (Dir External Affairs, Science Museum).

The panel members are; Sir Amyas Morse (Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office), Dame Margaret Hodge (MP), Dr David Halpern (Behavioural Insights Team), and Dr Ulrike Hotopp (Simetrica Ltd).

This event will entertain, engage and excite anyone with an interest in improving methods of policy evaluation across the energy, environment and food Nexus.

The panel will encourage debate on the Nexus policy areas at the heart of the Centre's work, and raise critical questions around complexity, evaluation methodologies, and 'what works in practice'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/events/13th-september-london-cecan-event-policy-evaluation-for-a-complex-world</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CECAN Seminar - What works at the Nexus? - Professor James Wilsdon. 25th January 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5FC4BAC-928E-45BF-96F0-0DCB834BE9F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CECAN team would like to extend thanks to Professor James Wilsdon from the University of Sheffield for his thought provoking discussions on 'What works at the Nexus' on 25th January 2017.
Drawing on insights from his role as director of the ESRC's Nexus Network, and vice-chair of the International Network for Government Science Advice (INGSA), James Wilsdon reflected on how the landscape for transdisciplinary, policy-engaged research is changing, and what opportunities may emerge through the Global Challenges Research Fund, reforms to the Research Excellence Framework and the creation of UK Research and Innovation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cecan.ac.uk/news/what-works-at-nexus-a-thought-provoking-seminar-from-professor-james-wilsdon</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK Evaluation Society Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CD2D24B6-F8BF-4527-BAA1-D1F9EE5DD021</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK Evaluation Society Annual Conference - 27April, London Invited presentation: Evaluating Complexity</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Professor Ian Christie - talk on CECAN for Green Alliance think-tank, London; 3rd November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B423E68B-942D-4BF5-B86D-DF2368CE6C99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Ian Christie - talk on CECAN for Green Alliance think-tank, London; 3rd November 2016 - Follow up meeting with Green Alliance being arranged.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CECAN presentation at Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F24F74A-22CE-4819-8A52-7531C0921F85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Candice Howarth presenting on CECAN at Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference (RGS-IBG), 'nexus theme' - 1st September</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.rgs.org/WhatsOn/ConferencesAndSeminars/Annual+International+Conference/Annual+International+Conference+2016.htm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ian C - talk on CECAN for audience of civil servants in Scottish Government working on climate policy, environment, economic development; venue - Scottish Government offices, South Quay, Edinburgh, 21st Sept. 2016;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D674CBE-D0E4-46CC-B159-01DCBA89427C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Ian Christie - talk on CECAN for audience of civil servants in Scottish Government working on climate policy, environment, economic development; venue - Scottish Government offices, South Quay, Edinburgh, 21st Sept. 2016; audience - approx. 40.
