Yet our knowledge of political opinion in each of the 650 constituencies which elect Members of Parliament (MPs) to Westminster is not nearly as clear, mainly because it is too expensive to survey large numbers of citizens in each constituency. This matters because good measures of political opinion in constituencies are necessary to answer fundamental questions about their role in British representative democracy. For example, is there a meaningful link between the behaviour of individual MPs in the House of Commons and political opinion in the constituencies they represent?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will generate new estimates of public opinion in Westminster constituencies. It will exploit new techniques for estimating public opinion in small areas, combining information from several existing data sources: ESRC-funded national surveys, Census data, and geographic information from the Ordinance Survey. &amp;nbsp;The investigators will first test the performance of these new techniques in British context. They will then use estimates of constituency opinion to investigate the democratic link between individual MPs and their constituencies in Britain on issues from same-sex marriage to Europe.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will have impact on three identifiable groups: Members of Parliament (MPs); public bodies interested in estimating local opinion; and the public. 

First, MPs benefit because they will better understand the opinions of their constituents on a range of specific political issues and also the general political orientation of their constituents. MPs claim to value correspondence with their constituents, and public opinion as revealed `on the doorstep', as means of gauging opinion in their constituency. We therefore believe that they will also value statistical information provided at the level of the individual constituency. We will maximise the impact of our research on MPs through a number of dissemination events in Westminster and through the publication of region-specific booklets giving information on local public opinion. Our dissemination events will enable us to demonstrate, to individual MPs, the state of public opinion in their constituency. Although much public opinion research could be said to benefit MPs by providing information on national public opinion, our impact is qualitatively different because we provide systematic information about political opinion in the individual constituencies MPs represent.

Second, public bodies interested in estimating local opinion benefit because our techniques can make it less costly for them to research local opinion. Public opinion research in general is costly. Generating representative samples at local level is costlier still. Attempts by individual councils are unlikely to be cost-effective. Attempts at national level, such as the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG)'s Place Survey, are extremely expensive. Our impact therefore comes through meeting with these organisations and offering them techniques to deliver estimates of local opinion with greatly reduced sample sizes (and thus at a far lower cost). This impact is financial in nature, and is conditional on public bodies commissioning some kind of public opinion research across multiple local authority areas. However, the impact could be considerable if, through MRP+SCR, we could reduce the sample size in each local authority area by a factor of three or four. We note in our Pathways to Impact statement how we will meet with DCLG and suggest ways in which our research might be utilized.

Finally, our research benefits the general public by enriching public discourse on politics in Britain. In order to secure this impact, we have identified a number of regional newspapers to serve as suitable outlets for our findings. Citizens will also be able to use our outputs to find out about how political opinion varies geographically across Britain and about political opinion in their local constituency. The availability of systematic and easily digestible information on these matters will help citizens evaluate how well the political system responds to the will of the public and can help inform public debates concerning major political reforms, such as the recent proposal to introduce the AV electoral system in the UK. 

We also note that the general public may benefit indirectly from our aforementioned impact on MPs. Survey evidence indicates that the general public want MPs to pay more attention to the opinions of their constituents when making political decisions (Kellner 2012). Thus, if MPs change their behaviour in response to information about constituents' views, then our research will benefit the public through its impact on MPs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>116369</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>constituencyopinion.org.uk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91220524-D23F-4604-9A1A-89799149F630</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our blog disseminated information about our method of constituency opinion estimation and the results of our study.

We describe each of these in turn. 

Our first type of impact has been achieved through providing new information to Members of Parliament concerning public opinion in their respective constituencies. Our research generated new estimates of public opinion in each Westminster constituency on a number of policy topics. These estimates have been valuable to MPs wishing to gather information about the views of those they represent, as there were previously no publicly available, systematic and comprehensive measures of public opinion at the constituency level. 

To ensure that MPs were aware of and had access to our constituency opinion estimates, we collaborated with the House of Commons Library, who hosted a dissemination event entitled &amp;quot;Constituency Opinion and Representation in Britain&amp;quot; at Westminster in October 2014. At this seminar, we presented our methods and findings to an audience made up of MPs' aides, journalists (from national newspapers and national broadcasters), think tank employees and Commons Library staff. As a follow-up to this, we produced and printed a briefing booklet summarising our findings for a general audience. This booklet was mailed to all MPs, and was also posted on our website. Additionally, the investigators took care to mention the estimates in personal meetings with MPs.

We have several reasons to be confident that our constituency opinion estimates have been useful for MPs. This is indicated, first, by the fact that the Commons Library - a body whose main purpose is to provide &amp;quot;impartial information and research services for Members of Parliament and their staff in support of their parliamentary duties&amp;quot; - recognised the relevance of our research and was willing to support dissemination is in itself a form of impact. A second indication of the utility of our estimates is the fact that staff from MPs' offices took the time to attend our dissemination event. A third, yet stronger indication of utility is that we have received a number of direct requests from MPs' offices for further information on our estimates. A fourth indicator is that the Commons Library has also reported several requests for further information from MPs after our dissemination event. These all indicate that our constituency opinion estimates have been of use to MPs at Westminster. 

Our second type of impact has been to shape public understanding of the geography of political opinion in Britain. Given the absence of pre-existing measures of public opinion in each parliamentary constituency, our project outputs have been able to inform media and public discussions by, for example, providing new evidence about which parts of the country are more or less Eurosceptic, or more or less opposed to immigration. 

We have achieved significant public engagement in two ways. First, we engaged with national and regional media to maximise the chances that our findings reached a broad audience. For example, in October 2014 our findings were the focus of a page 2 article in The Times newspaper (print and online readership, 1,006,000), which also included on its website an interactive map showcasing our data. In addition to this, our estimates were reported by the Financial Times FT Data blog (the FT has over 500,000 online subscribers), the Press and Journal, and on regional television shows such as ITV's Around the House and Anglia Late Edition. We also published a summary chapter on our constituency opinion estimates in the popular social science book &amp;quot;Sex, Lies and the Ballot Box&amp;quot; (Eds. Cowley, P. and Ford, .R, Biteback 2014).

Second, we developed a website, constituencyopinion.org.uk. This website, which was designed for a general audience, housed a blog, data on our opinion estimates, and accompanying documentation. Importantly, it also hosts (heavily annotated) code, which can be downloaded and adapted by anyone who wants to generate new constituency opinion estimates from publicly available data. To date the website has had more than 30,000 visits and continues to garner upwards of 1500 visits per month. 

There is also a final, indirect, way in which our research has had an indirect impact on public discourse concerning the geography of political opinion in Britain: the methods tested, codebase generated and data assembled during the project have all contributed to the subsequent development of the statistical model underlying the electionforecast.co.uk website. This website, developed by the PI and Co-I together with Benjamin Lauderdale, provided constituency-level forecasts of the results of the 2015 General Election. Not only did the site receive significant public attention (over 1 million visits), but the forecasting model was used to provide regular in-depth analysis for BBC's flagship current affairs programme, Newsnight, and for the popular US website fivethirtyeight.com. The resulting features helped inform the public as to the geography of political opinion in Britain, and about the consequences of the British electoral system. The predictions were also featured in the Telegraph and Financial Times.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CAFE3075-EDC4-4314-AAEB-7473743EA792</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our project had two over-arching objectives. Our methodological objective was to validate new estimates of political opinion in Westminster parliamentary constituencies. Our substantive objective was to utilise these new estimates to gain new insights into the role of the constituency in British politics. On each front, we have made major contributions. 

First, we made a methodological contribution by showing that accurate estimates of political opinion in Westminster constituencies can be obtained using multilevel modelling and post-stratification (MRP) to combine national survey samples of 4,000 or more with information from Census data and geodata. Our evidence comes from two validation studies: an external validation, where we compared MRP estimates of parties' constituency vote shares with actual results at the 2010 general election; and a cross-validation, where we split a very large survey sample and compared MRP estimates of constituency opinion based on one portion of the sample with `true' opinion in the remainder. 

Second, we made a methodological contribution to the MRP literature more broadly. MRP can potentially involve several different elements, each drawing on different types of demographic or geographic information. For researchers with limited resources and access to data, it is important to understand how much each MRP element is likely to improve constituency opinion estimates. Compared to previous validation studies, ours assess a more comprehensive set of MRP elements. We find that although using more elements is generally better, in a setting like the British one, where the number of constituencies is large, the largest and most consistent improvement in MRP performance comes from including constituency-level predictors. This is encouraging: researchers can achieve large marginal gains in the quality of constituency opinion estimates through a relatively low-cost search for relevant constituency-level data (e.g average age or earnings).

Third, we made a substantive contribution by providing a new mapping of the geography of political opinion in Britain. Combining survey data from the British Election Study, population data from the UK Census, and geodata from Ordinance Survey, we have generated new estimates of 2014 constituency opinion on three key topics: income redistribution; Britain's membership of the European Union; and the cultural impact of immigration. These new estimates of constituency opinion improve our understanding of demographic and geographic patterns in popular views on highly salient political topics.

Fourth, we made a broader substantive contribution by providing new evidence of a representational bond between MPs and their constituents. Across four cases (including whipped and un-whipped parliamentary behaviour), we show that the policy positions MPs take respond to opinion in their constituencies. This association between constituency opinion and MP position holds even when we look at MPs from within the same party. This suggests that constituency influence does not operate solely through choice of party, but that MPs are at least to some extent individually responsive to their constituents. Our results suggest the MP-constituent link is an under-appreciated channel for policy representation in Britain, and have implications for debates about electoral reform.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>First, our validation evidence regarding the relative contribution of different MRP elements informs future methodological work aimed at improving MRP methods. It also provides guidance for applied researchers estimating constituency opinion in settings similar to the British one.

Second, our new estimates of constituency opinion will be useful as explanatory variables for academics researching constituency-level phenomena including electoral outcomes, party campaign strategies, candidate positioning, and various aspects of MP behaviour (e.g. Commons votes and speeches). The estimates also offer MPs and prospective parliamentary candidates new information about the policy preferences of their constituents. This supplements the potentially less representative information that such actors receive through mailbags and canvassing, and can help politicians better understand those they represent.

Third, our finding that MPs are individually responsive to constituency opinion can be taken forward by academics and non-academics. Future academic research can look into whether such responsiveness is driven more by selection mechanisms or by re-election concerns. Our approach can also be used to test for responsiveness in other political systems. From a non-academic perspective, our evidence that there is some MP-constituency policy linkage can inform future debates about electoral reform in Britain, particularly with regard to the maintenance of single-member districts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4ED0E708-FF57-45B5-8B99-C1A1B184533C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://constituencyopinion.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have made a available code (with detailed annotation) that allows users to generate constituency opinion estimated within the open source software R and WinBUGS.</gtr:description><gtr:id>822BB006-2776-42C7-8293-F3C2D5B010E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This code enables anyone to generate new estimates of constituency opinion in Britain using new sources of survey data.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Code to generate constituency opinion estimates</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://constituencyopinion.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/code_documentation.zip</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This data set contains the new estimates of constituency opinion we have generated in our project.
