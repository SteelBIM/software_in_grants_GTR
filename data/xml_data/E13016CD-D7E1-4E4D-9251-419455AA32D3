The project is a cross sector partnership between universities and the theatre area of the cultural industries. The core institutions will be represented on the steering committee: the Universities of Leeds, Newcastle, Zhejiang, Nanjing, California Davis, British Columbia, and Queensland with the Royal Shakespeare Company, West Yorkshire Playhouse and Sichuan Peoples' Art Theatre. These institutions are leaders in their fields with international profiles which will be further enhanced by this proposed network. The RSC's first production of a Chinese play 'The Orphan of Zhao' (a 13th century classical play based on historical events during 600-500BC yet with period transcending themes) provides a good topic for the network to examine how China and Chinese culture are presented in intracultural, intercultural and transcultural theatre productions, and how languages and translations play a key role in stage productions to form or to alter people's perception of others' cultures.

Academic outputs in the funding period (01/2013 - 08/2014) 

We will carry out conventional and practice-led research (University of Leeds is an international leader for both), workshops for the future plan of the repository of stage productions, development of curricula on translating Chinese drama, and practical work involving professionals and general public. Through these activities, the network attempts to seek answers to the following research questions and related issues, allowing for further definition, clarification or alteration during the course of the project.

Primary question and related issues

How is China constructed and projected through intra/inter/trans-cultural stage productions in Chinese (including different dialects) and in English, and how can research into languages and translations contribute to understanding of the perceptions of China?

To answer the overarching question, the following will be addressed through proposed activities:

1. Why has the ancient play 'The Orphan' (first written in the 13th century based on historical events during 600-500BC) fascinated so many artists? What images do various Chinese productions (in the styles of indigenous song-dance theatre, Western-inspired spoken drama and Western opera) and now that of the RSC's attempt to create? How can a classical Chinese play be made relevant to today's British/ Chinese youth and how do we tackle language, culture and generation barriers? 

2. Is 'translation' involved in theatre even within China's own territories? Does 'translation' only mean 'verbal rendition' and what happens when a written text transfers to performance and travels from one regional genre to another in different dialects and stage vocabulary? What levels of translation are involved when an English poet adapts 'The Orphan' to be directed and performed by British artists? How does the intracultural encounter contribute to the intercultural work?

3. How does theatre shape perception of China and Chinese culture through the languages and translations it involves? 

4. What skills gaps exist in the UK, and what strategies exist to fill those gaps i.e. to help students build the capacity to tackle complicated language and culture issues in translations? The introduction of a new module 'Translating Chinese Drama' at Newcastle University will serve as a case study. 

5. How can intercultural theatres develop, based on a genuine dialogue in the highly complex global cultural landscape, engaging issues from broader perspectives involved in languages and translations?

6. How can digital technology be used to share knowledge and expertise on Chinese theatre and to enrich international and intercultural engagement?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cultural and social impact is embedded in the engagement of policy makers, creative &amp;amp; cultural industries professionals, theatre audiences and school pupils. Given current global dynamics, cross-cultural understanding between China and the West is of unprecedented significance. The use of culture by the Chinese government as an efficient tool is more explicit than in the UK, and understanding this is important for those directly involved in government and corporate decision-making and for an increasing number of citizens who find themselves working together in diverse contexts. It is exemplified by the initial contact that the RSC made to the PI when the company was considering to produce a Chinese play. It is evident that a network like this is demanded by the arts sector. The project offers an efficacious mechanism to improve cross-cultural understanding in a genuinely transnational and dialogic setting. Understanding how theatrical translation can influence inter-national perceptions is a valuable tool for public and private organisations.
The University of Leeds has robust and innovative methods for the support of knowledge exchange and impact activity. It has recently invested &amp;pound;850k in each of the PI and CI's Faculties to establish two transformational research projects - 'Arts Engaged' and 'Culture, Society, Innovation' - supported by a team of impact research fellows. These two projects are linked by a HEIF funded 'Creative Exchange Hub' and dedicated business manager who works with the School/Faculty Director of 'Innovation and Impact' to link research to business and public engagement. The system provides personnel and financial resources. Cross sector partnerships are a key strategy in the pursuit of the creation and dissemination of knowledge. For example, both Faculties are leading members of DARE the University's contractual partnership with Opera North, both have a successful record in AHRC collaborative doctorates, both provide regular consultancy t the cultural industries. Commercialisation opportunities - audience development, the application of drama within social/community education - are actively sought. Both PI and CI are experienced in working with partners from the third sector. 
Among the proposed activities, 1 and part of 2 will cover exhibition, workshop, and roundtable discussion of productions and interpretations of a classical Chinese play The Orphan including that of the RSC. Participants - school pupils, theatre professionals and the general public - will gain knowledge of the Chinese morality of sacrifice, friendship, bravery and justice, and be challenged to ponder the relevance of, and connections between, cultural heritage and contemporary life. Activity 6 focuses on two theatre companies in the UK and in China. By helping the West Yorkshire Playhouse and Sichuan People's Art Theatre achieve an intercultural production, individual artists and audiences will gain tremendous knowledge about the other's culture. The two companies will use the project to understand the ways in which such international development could be made an integral part of their respective structures and repertoires. Theatre in Education is a new and sought after aspect of drama in China. It is one of the strengths of the WYP and UoL, and the SPAT will particularly consider how the UK approaches can be transferred and sustained after the project. 
The Cao Yu project, in which the PI, CI and many partners have been involved, continues in the UK, North America and in China. Due to its variety of activities of exhibition, film screening, public lecture and performance, the project has impact on people at different levels. Initial dialogue has started between the network and the Shanghai cultural sector about adopting it as a model of culture outreach.
The planned future development of repository of stage productions, which will be used by academics, theatre professionals and the general public, will sustain this impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36091</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibition considers ten productions of The Orphan of Zhao which were created by practitioners from three countries - China, Korea and Britain - and span a range of theatrical genres: Chinese regional operas; Chinese spoken drama, Chinese opera in the Western style; as well as the recent English-language dramatization by the Royal Shakespeare Company.

Different theatre styles (see the diagram below) including Western-inspired spoken drama, the indigenous or traditional song-dance forms (including nearly 300 codified local genres) and other theatrical forms present daunting problems. Differences in language and culture raise barriers not found in dance and music.
Compared to the increasingly successful discipline of Chinese cinema that emerged in the 1980s, primary sources in Chinese theatre are largely inaccessible for researchers, theatre practitioners and the general public. This pilot of the Digital Library of Chinese Theatre offered by 'Staging China' attempts to see if electronic stage productions with bilingual annotation/ critical essays would be useful for non-Chinese native speakers or Chinese speakers with limited knowledge of theatre to further a preliminary interest in the subject. The pilot mainly offers samples of the Western-inspired form of modern spoken drama and the indigenous/traditional song-dance theatre. 

There are 4 main works in the pilot:
? The Story of Gong and Drum Lane (spoken drama, bilingual-subtitled).
? A scene from The Orphan of Zhao (yueju or shaoxingxi, one local genre in xiqu, the large family of the traditional song-dance theatre, bilingual-subtitled)
? The Sun is Not for Us (2011 &amp;amp; 2012). This is a newly created work in English based on the stories of female characters in 4 canonical plays written by Chinese dramatist Cao Yu to commemorate the playwright's centenary. It was performed in Leeds, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and toured China. 
? A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough (2016). This production in English was co-produced by University of Leeds (UK) and University of International Business and Economics (China) to celebrate the 400 years of cultural legacy of two great playwrights: William Shakespeare and Tang Xianzu. The Chinese side adapted Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, while the British group worked on a contemporary response to Tang's Nanke Ji. The young people's sensitivity and emotional expression were reflected in their interpretation of classics from each other's culture. It was performed in Leeds, at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and toured China. 
Each production contains its own available documents, such as programmes, critical reviews, images and so on. 

Surrounding these 4 major productions, there are introductions to 1) huaju, the Western-inspired modern spoken drama and 2) xiqu, the indigenous/traditional song-dance theatre. In order to give viewers an idea of the large spectrum of different styles of xiqu (the Chinese song-dance theatre), a variety have been logged. Some are highly stylised while others are closer to everyday life, yet they still use songs as their means of expression. The pilot thus offers over thirty short clips of different regional genres: some of which are taken from the genres' traditional repertoire while others are from newly written plays. Even within the newly written plays, some are based on historical stories whilst others present contemporary lives on the stage. These short clips are provided with brief introductions to the genre and the scenario of the play from which the clips are made. 

For one of the core works The Orphan of Zhao, this pilot also offers short clips or still images of 11 different versions of the same play, among which some are in the huaju form, some are in the xiqu style, and one is a Chinese Western operatic adaptation. There are three non-Chinese productions from Nigeria (Drama Section, Ahmadu Bello University, 1979), Korea (Michoo Theatre Company, 2006) and Britain (Royal Shakespeare Company, 2012). 

For those who want to read more research work on the Chinese theatre can see two attached documents. One contains books, articles, reviews, theatre productions and exhibitions during the last twenty years by colleagues who have closely worked with Staging China project since 2012. The other is a reference list compiled by Steven Siyuan Liu on the traditional song-dance theatre. 
Some feedbacks: 
From academia: 
1. It's too bad I am not teaching anymore now all these wonderful facilities are available. I immediately forwarded the link to the person in Leiden who teaches Chinese literature and performance.
2. What a great contribution to the scholarship! I will share it with my students. 
From practitioners: 
1. I just cannot imagine anything more useful at the present time.... please, please, keep on adding performances. This is one great advantage of Chinese theater, that it is all recorded! 
2. I browsed the website with keen interest .What pleasure you will be giving to a host of people by your great love's labor. I'm listening to the Yueju (Xiaoxing) The Butterfly Lovers.

At the centre of the project, there was the stage production 'A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough'. From two texts with the overarching theme of 'dreaming', students and staff from two universities created a new work. The creative team at the UIBE presented a piece inspired by the young lovers and fairies in Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream' while Leeds offered a contemporary response to Tang Xianzu's 'The Dream under the Southern Bough' (Nanke Ji). 

The play premiered on 27 July 2016 in Leeds, before moving on to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (5-13 August) followed by a tour of China (12-28 September), where it was performed in Shanghai, Beijing and Fuzhou (Tang Xianzu's hometown taking part in the International Festival of Tang Xianzu's plays). The performances attracted large audiences of approximately 800 in the UK and 1500 in China. Speaking at the Leeds premiere in July 2016, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming described the play as 'a creative interpretation of Shakespeare's and Tang's classic works. This ingenious re-production transcends time and culture, and brings two literary masters to the same stage.'

In order to extend the reach of the project, the team organised an accompanying series of lectures, seminars and workshops in the UK and China on Shakespeare, Tang Xianzu and the Chinese theatre. The project sent a Shakespearean Professor Martin Butler from Leeds (School of English) to China to give lectures on Shakespeare and Film in 4 cities at 6 universities, a school and Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre; his audiences reached approx. 2000. The project held seminars in China with researchers, critics and theatre practitioners and ran a workshop for the local students in Fuzhou on A Midsummer Night's Dream. In return, Professor Zou Yuanjiang, Deputy Chairman of the Tang Xianzu Research Association based at Wuhan University, undertook a lecture tour in the UK of four universities (Leeds, Newcastle, Aberdeen and London (SOAS)). The Chinese Embassy in the UK also invited him to give a talk on Tang Xianzu for the Embassy employees to improve their own understanding of China's literary master.

The project team at Leeds was a cross-Faculty, multi-disciplinary grouping from the Schools of Languages, Cultures and Societies; Performance and Cultural Industries; and English. It also involved fifteen postgraduate and undergraduate students from the three Schools, in addition to volunteers from the School of Fine Art, History of Art and Cultural Studies and Biology. Additional funding, totalling over &amp;pound;20,000, was provided by a range of organisations (including the Sino-British Fellowship Trust, the British Council, the Bank of China, China Eastern Airlines, and the Fuzhou Municipal Government). 

The stage play and seminars/workshops attracted a great deal of positive press attention, both in China and the UK, and was also covered by TV news stations, in particular CCTV International Channel, CCTV news, Jiangxi Provincial TV and Fuzhou TV. CCTV Documentary Film sent a filming team to follow the tour of the play in China for a documentary film entitled 'Tang Xianzu Encounters Shakespeare' (forthcoming). A number of academic publications will flow from the project, to be published in one of China's leading journals New Drama (Xin xiju), and the specialist journal Tang Xianzu Studies (Tang Xianzu yanjiu).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://chinesetheatre.leeds.ac.uk/plays/9</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Chinese theatrical elements in English Shakespeare performances, Zhejiang University, China</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8510CC55-0AE2-452E-96CF-6EE224A28C3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards.

This was a new project that Staging China developed from 2014-16. At the centre of the project was a newly-created stage production A Midsummer Night's DREAMING Under the Southern Bough based on famous works of the two playwrights which shared an overarching theme of 'dreaming.' The creative team at UIBE presented a piece inspired by the young lovers and fairies in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream while staff at the University of Leeds offered a contemporary response to Tang Xianzu's Dreaming Under the Southern Bough (Nanke Ji). The play premiered on 27 July 2016 in Leeds, before moving on to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe (5-13 August) followed by a tour of China (12-28 September), where it was performed in Shanghai, Beijing and Fuzhou (Tang Xianzu's hometown taking part in the International Festival of Tang Xianzu's plays). The performances attracted large audiences of approximately 800 in the UK and 1500 in China. Speaking at the Leeds premiere in July 2016, Chinese Ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming described the play as &amp;quot;a creative interpretation of Shakespeare's and Tang's classic works. This ingenious re-production transcends time and culture, and brings two literary masters to the same stage.&amp;quot; 

The project sent Professor Martin Butler, a famous Shakespearean to China to give a lecture tour at 6 universities, 1 school and at the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Centre. Audiences were over 2000. Pairing this activity, a Chinese professor on Tang Xianzu, Zou Yuanjiang, had a lecture at 4 British universities and attracted a good media coverage. Responding to this activity, the Chinese Embassy in the UK also invited him to give a talk on Tang Xianzu for the Embassy employees to improve their own understanding of China's literary master. Later, Chinese Embassy has also helped the project to gain financial support from Chinese companies. 

The project has attracted a large media coverage dating from March to October 2016, over 100 pieces.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/ambassador/t1385222.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Website which provides detail (much bi-lingual) of all activities within this AHRC research project within the wider context of the international research network itself.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD22F4C0-CB75-4D5B-A1A5-C59FCC258FC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>International knowledge of the project and of its potential; development by members in parallel of original research and of its dissemination; source to influence educators, academics, cultural organisations and public attitude towards Chinese culture and theatre</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Staging China Research Network</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.stagingchina.leeds.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Digital library storing visual and bi-lingual written research materials (e.g. primary sources for specific productions, academic critques) related to Chinese theatre to provide archtypes for further research and for dissemination to range of end users including academics, theatre professionals, cultural educators.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E04CA2BD-6CE1-4A26-BA2B-725A201F1ED4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To comment on when Digital Library is live in 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Digital Library of Chinese Theatre</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.stagingchina.leeds.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The academics and postgraduate translation students from the Universities of Queensland Australia and Newcastle UK are engaged in translating classic and contemporary Chinese plays previously unavailable in English.
