Through this project the University of Cambridge will jointly collaborate with Cambridge Carbon Capture Ltd (CCC) in developing their Patented CCM technology and participate in further innovations in mineral carbonation. The process creates a number of valuable by-products which more than compensates for the cost of capturing the CO2. CCC's process currently involves two stages, the digestion of Magnesium Silicate minerals to form Magnesium Hydroxide then the CO2 striping using the Magnesium Hydroxide to form Magnesium Carbonate. This project aims to investigate the feasibility of using low-cost powdered olivine/serpentine rock to capture CO2 directly from flue gases thereby simplifying the process and significantly reducing cost. Our objective in this project is
to acquire sufficient quantitative experimental data from a bench-scale gas-liquid-solid mixing rig to establish the technical feasibility and market relevance of CO2-scrubbing of flue gas by direct carbonation of olivine/serpentine.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed project investigates a new technology for using low-cost natural minerals to capture CO2. Acceleration of naturally slow reactions by use of special liquid-gas reaction system, which makes this process not only very unique but also much favourable as a low carbon technology. This also allows us to explore different options to utilise the reaction products to obtain commercially valuable products, as well as sequestration of CO2. The research findings will be presented at the biannual meetings of the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC) as well as
international conferences such as Accelerated Carbonation for Environmental and Materials Engineering (ACEME).

The proposed project can offer an innovative method for the CO2 capture which can work both as a part of a combined CCS technology, but also as a stand-alone CO2 sequestration technology to be used by smaller scale industries which may not be able to be a part of the CCS infrastructure. The thermodynamically stable products can store CO2 permanently under ambient environment, rather than temporarily holding CO2 as other CO2 capturing materials and methodologies. A diverse mix of low carbon technologies helps secure future energy security for the UK, by reducing the risk of problems that may arise with one type of technology. Demonstration of the feasibility of this process would be highly meaningful to the UK society, and is especially relevant to the UK manufacturing industries operating in smaller scale facilities that are financially constrained from participation in the development of major CCS infrastructure, as this could be implemented into their systems in a remote location. Publicity of research findings through the free and open access mentioned in the former
section will offer significant social and economic benefits. The involvement in the UK CCSRC activities, undertaking a wider networking role with the research and user community outside the project membership will also help to disseminate the
research outcomes. The most direct impact to the society will come from the interactions with the industrial project partner, Cambridge Carbon Capture Ltd. (mineral carbonation technology developer), and other contacts, who are the immediate
potential users of the research outcomes: Polarcus (marine seismic company), Tata steel (steel producer), Sibelco Europe (mineral producer), WRK design &amp;amp; service (CO2 capture equipment manufacturer). We have also established contacts with
by-product users and producers such as Goodyear and Rhodia.Our strong motivation to create a well-integrated active partnership will lead to new knowledge and innovations.

Impact in education and training will be an important focus in this project. Case study materials will be developed for teaching and training. Supporting junior researchers to travel to present papers in conferences and participate in networking will enhance innovative outcomes in their research such that it is linked to an overall objective. It is intended that the above outcomes will have relevance to energy sustainability issues faced not only in the UK but globally and lead to new technologies and scientific methodologies that can stimulate further scientific and technological activities. Thus
immediate impact can be seen within the academic community in terms of new and niche UK research, educational areas in terms of skills development and teaching materials and policy areas in terms of growing realistic options within the energy diversity goals. Depending upon the initial promise and subsequent progress in this area, major impact can be expected in exploding research in low carbon energy systems development, fabrication and testing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>122432</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contact with potential industrial user in India</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8776CC64-1F6D-4505-A067-2F04D49D9D28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Purpose of this engagement is to deliver business opportunity for CCC Ltd and an industrial group in India who have procured a new business emitting CO2 which they wish to capture with a cost-effective technology.
