The kinetic model and insights developed in the project have helped developing efficient catalyst for transesterification reaction in the work: Karmakar, A., da Silva, M. F. C.

There are many other works (&amp;gt;15) cited the findings from the project in the context of kinetic modelling, multi-scale transfer modelling, new catalyst development and efficient and sustainable process development.
Furthermore, a successful IAA project: Bioresource knowledge &amp;amp; data system targeted for downstream conversions (Bio-TARG) by Prof. Richard Murphy &amp;amp; Dr Jhuma Sadhukhan, University of Surrey and Geoffrey Drage &amp;amp; Kenneth Day, Bio-Sep Ltd. have been started. aims to develop a knowledge data system for biomass raw materials (primarily lignocellulosic residues) in order to deliver the specific information needed for accurate techno-economic modelling of downstream processing and biorefining. This knowledge data system is needed because existing agri-forest databases, which tend to be yield-only based, lack the appropriate technical and economic parameter information necessary for downstream biorefining modelling (e.g. hemicellulose composition, recalcitrance indicators, geographic distribution and concentration of residue materials, residue prices and seasonality, etc.). The development and structuring of this knowledge and data is highly relevant to both academic and industrial research on biorefining and for policy and decision-making.
The research findings have been assimilated into the first authored advanced level textbook 'Biorefineries and Chemical Processes' in the field of biorefinery engineering, published by Wiley, being adopted as textbook or main reference book in many universities: Manchester, Huddersfield, Oxford, Imperial College, Nottingham Malaysia and universities in Hong Kong, China, Iran, South Africa and India. We foresee wide adoption of the book as the textbook.
In Surrey, this is going to be the textbook in many modules in Chemical Engineering: e.g. Biorefinery Engineering, Bioprocess Engineering, Sustainability etc.
Professor Grant Campbell (Huddersfield) says about the book 'It looks so substantial (in the literal sense of containing a lots of tangible substance) and so high quality! The scope and quality of the resources, including the additional web material, are extensive, and the pedagogical innovations and presentation are creative and empowering. I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer by giving a basis for educating the biorefinery engineers who will actually bring about the power and contribution that biorefineries, correctly conceived, designed and operated, can deliver.'
Professor Nilay Shah (Imperial College) says about the book 'Very comprehensive!' He sees the book to serve as the textbook for some Chem Eng modules in Imperial College.
Professor Colin Webb (Manchester) is using the book as a reference book for Biorefinery Engineering module he teaches.
Dr Carol Lin (Hong Kong) is using the book as the textbook in her courses.
The Engineering course in the University of Oxford is adopting the book to teach process simulation approaches.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>054300C5-7621-4B8B-ADBE-E6A7AEED6EE9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Driven by the need to develop a wide variety of products with low environmental impact, biorefineries need to emerge as highly integrated facilities.

An approach combining process integration, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analyses is developed for non-food waste based biorefinery design, primarily producing biodiesel using oil-based heterogeneously catalysed transesterification or green diesel using hydrotreatment. The global warming potential from GHG emissions of the net energy produced (i.e. after covering energy requirements by the biorefinery systems) was 29 g CO2-eq per MJ output energy production, before accounting credits from displacement of fossil-based energy by bioenergy exported from the biorefineries. Using a systematic integration approach for utilisation of whole biorefinery, it is shown that global warming potential and fossil primary energy use can be reduced significantly if the integrated process schemes combined with optimised whole life cycle economic and environmental costs are adopted in waste-based biorefineries. The work provides multi-scale simulation tools as well as systems optimisation tools.

Important systems tools and observations include:

1. Differential economic and environmental impact analyses from units to systems.
2. Analysis across the scale linking process to system variables and design objectives.
3. Biorefinery Computer Aided Process Engineering (CAPE) tool in Excel-VBA platform http://biorefinerydesign.webs.com.
4. Cradle-to-grave environmental impact costs and credit values of streams are estimated.
5. Equivalent economic indicators are the cost of production and value on processing.
6. A novel economic value and environmental impact (EVEI) analysis methodology emerged from the combination of the value analysis method for maximisation of economic potential with environmental footprinting for impact minimisation.
7. Tighter policy directives can be in place if EVEI tool is employed.
8. The proposed tool is effective to target for stricter climate change mitigation policy.
9. A biofuel facility must be supplied with in-process generation of utilities.
10. Integrated biofuel with on-site raw material production is more sustainable.
For the multi-scale simulation, the following project goals were achieved.
We produced a framework for kinetic reaction and diffusive transport modelling of the heterogeneously catalysed transesterification of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). In particular, the work makes recommendations on multicomponent diffusion calculations such as the diffusion coefficients and molar fluxes from infinite dilution diffusion coefficients using the Wilke and Chang correlation, intrinsic reaction kinetic studies using the Eley-Rideal kinetic mechanism with methanol adsorption as the rate determining steps and multi-scale reaction-diffusion process simulation between catalytic porous and bulk reactor scales.
An entire book chapter in the First Advanced Authored Textbook of its kind (Biorefineries and Chemical Processes: Design, Integration and Sustainability Analysis) on the subject has been devoted. This textbook is designed to bridge a gap between engineering design and sustainability assessment, for advanced students and practicing process designers and engineers. Chapter 18: Heterogeneously Catalyzed Reaction Kinetics and Diffusion Modeling: Example of Biodiesel: 
&amp;quot;Biodiesel is fast becoming one of the key transport fuels as the world endeavors to reduce its carbon footprint and find viable alternatives to oil-derived fuels. The chapter presents material pertaining to various aspects of the multiscale modeling of heterogeneously catalyzed reaction systems. Modeling of the intrinsic kinetics has been shown for Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and Hattori mechanisms with assumptions of rate limiting steps. The UNIQUAC model for activity and concentration correlations for a non-ideal reaction system has been shown with calculations for transesterification reactions between triglyceride and methanol for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production. Analytical integration by Taylor's series first-order expansion can be done to estimate concentration versus time profiles of species.

Our work jointly with ENERGY J.H. S.A. de C.V. to develop Jatropha biorefinery systems for Mexico demonstrates the following.
Driven by the need to develop a wide variety of products with low environmental impact, biorefineries need to emerge as highly integrated facilities. This becomes effective when overall mass and energy integration through a centralised utility system design is undertaken. An approach combining process integration, energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission analyses is shown in this paper for Jatropha biorefinery design, primarily producing biodiesel using oil-based heterogeneously catalysed transesterification or green diesel using hydrotreatment. These processes are coupled with gasification of husk to produce syngas. Syngas is converted into end products, heat, power and methanol in the biodiesel case or hydrogen in the green diesel case. Anaerobic digestion of Jatropha by-products such as fruit shell, cake and/or glycerol has been considered to produce biogas for power generation. Combustion of fruit shell and cake is considered to provide heat. Heat recovery within biodiesel or green diesel production and the design of the utility (heat and power) system are also shown. The biorefinery systems wherein cake supplies heat for oil extraction and seed drying while fruit shells and glycerol provide power generation via anaerobic digestion into biogas achieve energy efficiency of 53 % in the biodiesel system and 57 % in the green diesel system. These values are based on high heating values (HHV) of Jatropha feedstocks, HHV of the corresponding products and excess power generated. Results showed that both systems exhibit an energy yield per unit of land of 83 GJ per ha. The global warming potential from GHG emissions of the net energy produced (i.e. after covering energy requirements by the biorefinery systems) was 29 g CO2-eq per MJ, before accounting credits from displacement of fossil-based energy by bioenergy exported from the biorefineries. Using a systematic integration approach for utilisation of whole Jatropha fruit, it is shown that global warming potential and fossil primary energy use can be reduced significantly if the integrated process schemes combined with optimised cultivation and process parameters are adopted in Jatropha-based biorefineries.

The inventory analysis included the following steps, detailed definition of the system, data collection, allocation and quantification of the environmental burdens. The impact assessment were carried out using the following steps: i. Classification; ii. Characterization; iii. Normalization; iv. Valuation. Interpretation of an LCA study included identification of major burdens, impacts, hot spots; identification of areas with a scope for improvement; sensitivity analysis; robustness of results; evaluation and recommendations. A number of LCIA methods were included to predict impact under various categories. The LCIA methods also included combinations of primary as well as mid- or end-point impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0503C14-3FDA-43C4-853A-513EFFFA6659</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The LCA tools developed are taught as part of the LCA course in Surrey, attended by regular Masters students and EngDs. As a result, the tools have been adopted by dedicated teams in organisations, National Physical Laboratory, Nestle, TWI Ltd., Recycling Technologies, Universidad de C&amp;aacute;diz, Universities of Birmingham and Reading and by various EU funded consortia. The tools help to demonstrate emission cuts achievable by appropriate technologies to policy makers, and graphically explain other multi-criteria benefits.

Material pertaining to various aspects of the multiscale modeling of heterogeneously catalyzed reaction systems have been presented. Modeling of the intrinsic kinetics has been shown for Eley-Rideal (ER), Langmuir-Hinshelwood-Hougen-Watson (LHHW) and Hattori mechanisms with assumptions of rate limiting steps. The UNIQUAC model for activity and concentration correlations for a non-ideal reaction system has been shown with calculations for transesterification reactions between triglyceride and methanol for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) production. Analytical integration by Taylor's series first-order expansion has been done to estimate concentration versus time profiles of species. A simulation framework for implementation of a multiscale diffusion-reaction model has been provided.</gtr:description><gtr:id>485FF13A-47C1-476F-A7C8-0C9000570242</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Computer models help to
