Cognitive ageing, the process by which some cognitive abilities decline in older age, is of particular concern, leading as it does to reduced quality of life, loss of independence, and, in its later stages, increased risk of dementia. Characterising the biological causes of cognitive ageing is therefore important if we are to reduce the burden of ageing at both the individual and societal level.

In this proposal we request funds to collect and analyze brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and carotid artery Doppler ultrasound data from participants of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. They are a large group of relatively healthy community-dwelling subjects in their late seventies. This cohort is unique in having cognitive data from youth (a well-validated measure of IQ obtained at age 11 years), and repeat cognitive testing, brain imaging, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, psychological, social and other important information obtained from ages 70, 73, 76 years, and to be collected at age 79.

By undertaking a third wave of brain MRI and carotid ultrasound scanning, we will have detailed imaging data spanning most of the eighth decade of life (73 to 79 years) during which risk of dementia increases. Longitudinal imaging data obtained at three time points in older age is rare and will allow a thorough exploration of changes in brain structure with age (e.g. loss of brain grey and white matter), how these changes relate to cognitive ability measured across the whole life course, and what factors (e.g. genetics, diet, exercise, etc.) are most responsible for these changes. Understanding these relationships is an important step in helping to develop strategies to slow age-related cognitive decline, and in characterising what role cognitive ageing plays in heralding dementia.

The present application is for minority funding for a project that also has funding from Age UK for the collection of the cognitive, medical, biomarker, and psychosocial data and their collation and analyses.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Studying the changes in brain structure that accompany older age may be useful for understanding cognitive ageing and reducing the risk of dementia in the elderly. We seek funds to acquire a 3rd wave of brain MRI and a 2nd wave of carotid Doppler ultrasound data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, a large group of relatively healthy subjects in their late seventies. This cohort has a wide range of phenotypic data available from older age (at 70, 73, 76; 79 to be done) including cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, etc. Uniquely, they also have a measure of childhood intelligence from age 11. These subjects have already undergone brain MRI at ages 73 and 76, and vascular imaging at age 73. Repeat brain MRI and ultrasound scanning at age 79 will provide multi-time-point longitudinal imaging data across the eighth decade of life. This will be used to investigate associations between older age brain structure, vascular, genetic and other risk factors, and cognitive ability across the life course.

This 3rd wave of brain MRI will be undertaken on the same GE 1.5T clinical scanner as used in the first two examinations. The imaging protocol will consist of structural, diffusion tensor (DT), magnetization transfer (MT) and quantitative T1-mapping sequences. The structural scans will be analyzed to provide measures of brain atrophy, cortical thickness and white matter hyperintensity volume. The DT, MT and T1 data will be used to segment a range of major white matter tracts and provide measures of the integrity of these structures.

These imaging data will be analyzed using methods such as structural equation and longitudinal latent growth curve modelling to examine associations, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, with cognitive, genetic, epigenetic, lifestyle, and other phenotypic data to provide insights into the factors driving non-pathological cognitive ageing. The carotid Doppler ultrasound data will be used as outcome and predictor variables.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries from this project will be older people and older people's groups, carers, health and social care practitioners and policymakers, academics and the wider public. A knowledge exchange (KE) strategy is already in place and has an excellent track record of engagement with these diverse groups. CCACE has a dedicated KE Officer (funded by the University of Edinburgh) and one of his main foci is the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936. This is an unusual resource and ensures regular and effective public engagement and KE activity. We have also co-developed a formal Joint Impact Plan with our primary funders, Age UK. This is a detailed framework for current and future KE activities which reflects our mutual ambitions to realise the potential for impact beyond academia throughout the lifetime of the project period. We are committed to maintaining our successful KE strategy to improve understanding of cognitive and brain ageing and identifying which potentially preventable factors affect brain health and cognitive function. 

For older people, carers and public health providers, our research has the potential to lead to interventions to prevent or ameliorate age-related cognitive decline and provides clinical benefits through the development of methods for more accurate diagnosis of dementia. For third sector organisations, our research will provide benefits in terms of advice and support they can offer to older people who are concerned about cognitive ageing and brain health. It is hoped that our findings will ultimately contribute to future healthcare policy, which will ideally serve to prolong the amount of time in old age during which individuals remain cognitively healthy and independent. 

We will continue to proactively engage directly with policy makers at a national and local government level and indirectly through our 3rd sector close partners such as Age UK, Age Scotland and Alzheimer Scotland and public sector organisations such as NHS Health Scotland and Edinburgh City Council. Age UK's direct engagement with older people is critical to successful exchange of Disconnected Mind-generated knowledge with the public. This is particularly pertinent for medium and short-term impact. Research findings so far signal that in the future, people will be able to take informed decisions to influence their own brain and cognitive health and that there are significant messages for public health (e.g. physical fitness and brain white matter integrity). Lifestyle factors, controllable physical factors and social factors are most likely to be the focus of Age UK's KE activity. Regular contact between Age UK and the research team allows Age UK to disseminate new findings to the wider Age UK family through audience-appropriate Insight and Evidence briefings. These, in turn, allow various parts of Age UK to use this knowledge for the benefit of older people in the form of services, products and influencing activities. These include publications such as overview articles for the general public and for policy makers and through co-produced key stakeholder workshops which aim to raise awareness of brain and cognitive ageing and their determinants. 

As well as our joint work with charities, we will continue to engage with policy makers through Cross-party Groups, committees, policy-focussed meetings, networking events and consultations. We will also seek to engage policy makers through our programme of stakeholder workshops. We will continue to engage with schools, families and the media using presentations, workshops, museum and science festivals, our presence on policy committees, art collaborations (previous examples include theatre, portraits, short films and a CCACE-published book of short stories) and via our established online following. CCACE has been particularly successful in engaging individuals and groups through integrated online content.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1052368</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National Museum of Scotland exhibition - LBC1936</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DB286E3-6EE8-426A-B512-B40E3BD6004F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From 8 July 2016, the National Museum of Scotland (Edinburgh) have unveiled a new exhibit, John Scott's brain. 

LBC1936 participant, Mr John Scott saw his brain for the first time in January this year at the National Museum of Scotland's Collections Care Centre. STV and the LBC team were there to witness Mr Scott seeing a 3D print of his living brain, taken from MRI data captured as part of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study. The 3D print will go on display in the museum from 8 July 2016, along with a stunning representation of Mr Scott's white matter (tractography) etched in crystal glass. When asked how he felt about having his brain on display in the National Museum, Mr Scott said &amp;quot;It's great, I told my grandchildren, when I'm not here, you can go and see my brain!&amp;quot;


You can hear Mr Scott talking about his experience on STV News (from 15:30) at http://player.stv.tv/episode/36pt/news-at-six-edinburgh-east-full/thu-07-jan-6-00-pm/

Dr Simon Cox, MRC Imaging Fellow on the LBC1936 study, said &amp;quot;I am used to looking at brain images on the computer day-to-day, but seeing a real model of the brain's white matter connections in glass and the outer surface of the brain like this is a unique experience - they are incredibly striking objects&amp;quot;. 

The brain imaging in LBC1936 is overseen by CCACE Group Leaders Professor Joanna Wardlaw and Dr Mark Bastin of Edinburgh Imaging and suported by funding from Age UK and the MRC. The 3D models of the brain surface and white matter were developed by Dr Mark Bastin and Dave Liewald in collaboration with Sophie Goggins, Assistant Curator of Biomedicine at the National Museum of Scotland and the Edinburgh College of Art (3D printed model).

&amp;quot;It's always a good sign when they have to put out extra chairs,&amp;quot; said Ian Deary, after his talk on 16th February to Penicuik's branch of the University of the Third Age. &amp;quot;They said they usually get 30-50 people, but I lost count after 60. It's great to see such enthusiasm for hearing about healthy cognitive ageing and the Lothian Birth Cohorts' contribution to that. I encouraged people in the audience to ask any questions as we went along, and they were good at that. However, there were lots more excellent questions and discussions at the end of the talk. They wanted to know the evidence about many things, including genetics, dementia, physical exercise, smoking, sleep and cognitive engagement. I was especially pleased, when I was having my tea and custard cream afterwards, when an audience member congratulated my team on demonstrating reverse causation for some potential factors in cognitive ageing!&amp;quot; We note that Ian cycled to and from Penicuik to give the talk, which we hope contributed a little towards keeping him sharp.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ccace.ed.ac.uk/node/342</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF2FA5D7-9E7B-4231-93B2-573F18EEBB77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A treasure trove of artefacts relating to this pioneering educational psychologist will be displayed at the Univeristy of Edinburgh from Friday 29th July until 29th October. Entrance to the exhibition is free, and it is open to the public.

Piles of intriguing ledgers and personal mementos will feature in an exhibition reconstructing the life and work of Professor Sir Godfrey Thomson. Sir Godfrey - who led the world's only nationwide IQ tests, in Scotland - was an innovative educator who firmly belived that educational opportunity should not be linked to social staus. From the 1920s onwards he advocated comprehensive education. Thomson was based at the Moray House School of Education, now part of the University of Edinburgh. His greatest legacy for today's researchers was to test the intelligence of almost every Scottish 11-year-old child in 1932, and again in 1947. 

For the first time, the Scottish Mental Survey's unique ledgers will go on public view, with a selection of sample pages on show. The ledgers hold the world's only record of IQ-type scores from full national year-of-birth cohorts.

Sir Godfrey's findings have formed the basis of much of the cutting-edge research at the University of Edinburgh since the late 1990's into how the brain ages, led by Professor Ian Deary. His team studies the now-older people who took part in the Scottish Mental Surveys.

Ian has spent the past decade investigating Sir Godfrey's life, and in 2008 he rescued a mass of never-before-seen documents and objects from Thomson's family home in Edinburgh, just before it was demolished. A selection of those artefacts, portraits and documents feature in the exhibition, telling the story of who Sir Godfrey was and what his motivations were.

Ian Deary said: &amp;quot;Godfrey Thomson saw mental ability tests as an imperfect but useful means to give poor children a chance in life. He was determined to look past pupils' social status, and try to see their underlying ability. By all accounts he was modest, not motivated by money, and happy to share academic wins, which in part led him to fade from the history books. I'm delighted we are now able better to understand and evaluate the pioneering work of this multi-talented and elusive man.&amp;quot;

BBC1 are planning a series in the Spring called 'Holding back the years'. Each programme will feature a celebrity revisiting a place that means a lot to them, and the programmes will have a focus on the processes of human ageing. Mr Turnbull was at the University of Edinburgh in the 1970's (he shared a flat with Gordon Brown for a term!), and so his programme is based here. It was natural that, to find out more about ageing, and with an Edinburgh locus, he and the BBC filming team visited the LBC1936. A busy afternoon's filming was filled with his interviewing LBC1936 Director Ian Deary, speaking with about a dozen of the LBC1936 participants, and seeing and taking part in some cognitive testing.

In each of the 11 rooms, the had 10 minutes to experience a different aspect of the ageing brain and body. Popular activities included a supermarket sweep game, shopping for the lifestyle factors which affect how our brain ages (like smoking) while busting a few myths (like the lack of effect of brain training). The Maze finished with a cafe where participants got the chance to speak with scientists and reflect on their experience of the Maze. One of the main comments was that, having spent 2 hours in the maze chatting to scientists, people would have liked more time in each room.

The purpose of BRAINS is to provide sharing and archiving of detailed normal human brain imaging and relevant phenotypic data, to create better estimates of the range of normal brain size and integrity across the life-course. The Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 and 1936 brain imaging data along with limited clinical data has been added to this resource.

BRAINS is a living imagebank where new data will be added when available. Initially BRAINS will contain existing data from n=763 healthy volunteer subjects, range neonatal and 19-81 years of age, from projects in 3 centres. A further n=2119 subjects aged from prenatal to 90 years old with existing records from 15 other projects in Scotland are currently being collected, collated and quality control (QC) checked. Additional completed and ongoing studies of normal individuals will be uploaded as they become available.

The data include several magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences, including T1, T2, T2*, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), in DICOM and NIfTI format, and a wide range of linked metadata, such as age, history, physiological measures (e.g. blood pressure), cognitive ability, and perinatal information (neonatal data).

Data access is governed by a steering committee comprising the PIs of the contributing studies, experts in ethics, law and governance, and lay representatives. Applications for data access can be made online, and will be granted by the steering committee subject to the completion of a formal Data Access Agreement.
