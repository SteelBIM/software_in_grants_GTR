Nevertheless, there is still very significant scope for increasing crop productivity by increasing the conversion efficiency of photosynthesis by decreasing the proportion of assimilated carbon that is lost through simultaneous metabolic processes. One such process, photorespiration, is in principle completely expendable and yet can account for assimilate losses of 25-50%.

The objective of this proposal is to introduce a cyanobacterial carboxysome-based CO2 concentrating mechanism into the chloroplasts of a model C3 plant (tobacco) in order to reduce, or eliminate, photorespiration. The incorporation of higher capacity, cyanobacterial forms of Rubisco into such carboxysomes will also be pursued, having the potential to further enhance photosynthetic capacity and nitrogen use efficiency. These objectives will be addressed using a multidisciplinary approach, through the collaboration of several research groups, each contributing complementary expertise in the essential areas of carboxysome genetics and assembly, plant transformation, photosynthetic systems modelling and physiological and biochemical characterisation of whole plant and component photosynthetic processes. The genetic elements governing the level of expression of cyanobacterial genes in the plant nucleus and chloroplast and the carboxysome proteins essential for the assembly of stable carboxysomes will be determined. We will develop systems modelling algorithms to predict (a) the most effective biochemical and anatomical features to maximise the value of carboxysomes in higher plant chloroplasts; and (b) the optimal investment of resources to maximise nitrogen use efficiency in such plants. To increase our understanding of the operation carboxysomes in chloroplasts, through iterative, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and immunochemical characterization of carboxysome composition, together with parallel physiological and biochemical characterization of photosynthetic performance, in transformed plants.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will address the fundamental issue of the ability to express key prokaryotic proteins in higher plants, while addressing a key societal issue, an ability to keep pace with increasing global demand for grain production. To our knowledge this would be the first expression of a protein-based prokaryotic organelle (carboxysome) in a eukaryote, which in turn would be a prototype for a potential anaerobic compartment for new enzymatic activities, e.g. nitrogen fixation. It would allow the use of a Rubisco that is 3x faster than current C3 plant Rubiscos, allowing a huge reduction in N use. A crop plant model will be the experimental system. It will also deliver a theoretical framework and computational workbench to guide engineering and optimization of components of the CO2 concentrating mechanism. The project will also form a truly cross-disciplinary and trans-national team combining labs which specialize in: a) transformation of plastid and nuclear genomes and engineering genes for appropriate expression (Hanson); b) carboxysome and CA structural, functional and genetic diversity, and their adaptive evolution (Kerfeld); c) metabolic, systems and scaling models of photosynthesis (Long); and d) Rubisco, regulation, molecular physiology and phenotype characterization.(Parry). All collaborators will train postdoctoral associates, who will gain unusually broad training through exposure to the disparate expertise of the PIs and their labs. Depending on their home lab, trainees will receive either intensive training or exposure to cyanobacterial and chloroplast molecular genetics, structural biology, physiology of carbon assimilation, metabolic and systems modeling of photosynthesis, and fluorescence and electron microscopy. Exchanges between labs and international conferences will allow postdoctorals to learn about these diverse research areas and to network with leading researchers from around the world. All collaborating labs will offer undergraduate summer research experiences during the academic year and summer and all will participate in programs that encourage underrepresented minority participation. PI Long's Lab has trained 3-5 McNair US Minority undergraduates through summer research experiences as part of NSF supported research for the past 7 summers. Two of these students have won the annual award for the best research presentation, and 18 of the students have continued into Ph.D. programs in biological sciences at a range of Universities. The McNair movement formally recognized the consistent contribution PI Long had made in 2008. The McNair Scholars Summer Research Institute will assist in identifying appropriate candidates, provide research methods training, a 3-4 day visit to another research school, graduate school application support, and GRE training and support. PI Kerfeld's group will develop a new module for the IMG Annotation Collaboration Tool (IMG-ACT) which is widely used to teach bioinformatics and genomics to undergraduate students in the US23. The module will focus on prospecting for homologs to plant genes in microbial genomes. Subsequent comparative analysis will include sequence similarity, domain identification, protein structure comparison, active site identification and the construction of a phylogenetic tree.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>210283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>3rd Synthetic Biology Congress, 20th -21st October, 2016, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FFA7D6D4-A407-4C7E-ACCC-BF7297B814AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation 'Synthesis of Microcompartments in Plants for Enhanced Carbon Fixation' at the 3rd Synthetic Biology Congress, 2016, London</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>World Life Science Conference in Plant and Environment session, Beijing 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CDDF6E8-5A2D-48F9-A756-66DFD3C9C10E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote lecture 'Improving Photosynthesis the engine of Life to Increase Crop Yields' in Plant and Environment session at the World Life Science Conference, Beijing 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>?

Increasing the concentration of CO2 around Rubisco is a strategy used by photosynthetic prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria for more efficient incorporation of inorganic carbon. Engineering the cyanobacterial CO2-concentrating mechanism, the carboxysome, into chloroplasts is an approach to enhance photosynthesis or to compartmentalize other biochemical reactions to confer new capabilities on transgenic plants. We have have transiently expressed multiple ?-carboxysomal proteins in tobacco leaves with fusions that target these proteins into chloroplasts, and that provide fluorescent labels for visualizing the resultant structures. By confocal and electron microscopic analysis, we have observed that the shell proteins of the ?-carboxysome are able to assemble in plant chloroplasts into highly organized assemblies resembling empty microcompartments. We demonstrate that a foreign protein can be targeted with a 17-amino-acid CcmN peptide to the shell proteins inside chloroplasts. In tobacco plants we also managed to replace the native tobacco Rubisco with that from cyanobacteria and recover transformed lines that were photosynthetically competent, supporting autotrophic growth, at near wild type rates at elevated CO2 concentrations but with much less Rubisco. These are important step towards improved photosynthesis in plants and establish the feasibility of introducing a functional cyanobaterial concentrating mechanism into chloroplasts of crop plants</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The micro-compartment may be used for other purposes such as nitrogen fixation or packaging of phramaceuticals</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7406A9FD-3F13-416D-B657-8D583539B1FA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4DA1E8D3-AF96-434C-81E2-4B77DBBFA792"><gtr:id>4DA1E8D3-AF96-434C-81E2-4B77DBBFA792</gtr:id><gtr:title>A faster Rubisco with potential to increase photosynthesis in crops.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/36a09b5153469a34412de5f1382a8a2a"><gtr:id>36a09b5153469a34412de5f1382a8a2a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lin MT</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0028-0836</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/517DD1DB-77C7-4A6C-BB5F-6C1D84341DC9"><gtr:id>517DD1DB-77C7-4A6C-BB5F-6C1D84341DC9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optimizing Rubisco and its regulation for greater resource use efficiency.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant, cell &amp;
