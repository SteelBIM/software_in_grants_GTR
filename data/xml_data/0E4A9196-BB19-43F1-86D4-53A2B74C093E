The main objective of this project is to significantly extend our understanding of the range of neurocognitive correlates of maltreatment, and relate these to future psychological functioning. It will address several important questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Is autobiographical memory recall predictive of future psychological functioning in maltreated children?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What is the neurocognitive basis of atypical autobiographical memory in maltreated children?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Do neural correlates of maltreatment predict later psychological functioning?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what degree are neural correlates associated with maltreatment stable over time?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Are their sex differences in how maltreatment impacts brain structure and function?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>These questions will be addressed by a longitudinal functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study comparing children exposed to maltreatment with matched non-maltreated peers. Both groups will be seen when they are 12-14 years old for a structural and functional brain scan and again two years later. The functional tasks investigate both autobiographical memory and affect processing. It is hoped that this research will contribute to a better understanding of the impact of maltreatment on children and help inform more effective forms of prevention and treatment.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We plan to build on our already successful impact strategy developed for our previous ESRC grant (see end of grant report; RES-061-25-0189). We will continue to work closely with a broad range of potential beneficiaries including: 

Clinicians and practitioners including social workers, health visitors, psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and psychotherapists. In the short to medium term our research will help inform a clinical model of how maltreatment influences emotional brain systems and its link to increased vulnerability to psychological and behavioural problems. The PI and Co-I recently organised a conference attended by over 250 clinicians (October 2011 &amp;quot;Childhood Disorders: Neuroscience and Intervention&amp;quot;) that paired presentations from both leading academics and expert practitioners. We will also organize a new conference &amp;quot;Maltreatment: Neuroscience and Intervention&amp;quot; aimed at practitioners to disseminate the project findings at the end of the project. 

In the longer-term we hope that gains from this project will contribute to improved clinical assessment of emotional disturbance, better clinical guidelines in meeting the needs of children experiencing maltreatment (including systemic intervention), and more effective individual interventions with those children most at risk for long term psychiatric and antisocial problems following maltreatment. Short briefing downloadable documents will be created for clinicians and practitioners that will be uploaded onto our UCL Unit website (www.drru-research.org). 

Children's charities including organisations such as the NSPCC and Anna Freud Centre. The PI works for NSPCC and has strong links with the Anna Freud Centre. We propose to establish a formal advisory board with a representative from children's charities chaired by the PI in order to consider how the findings of the proposed study are relevant to their work. This will include:

i. Continuing to support their case for intervention: many of these charities lobby government to increase provision for children in need, particular those who experience abuse. 
ii. Providing additional evidence of the impact of maltreatment relevant to increasing public and media awareness of this societal problem 
iii. Informing new policy initiatives 
iv. Convening workshops and seminars within each organisation for frontline practitioners

Policy makers including the Department of Children, Schools and Families, The Department of Health, and the Department of Justice will have a direct interest in the focus of the current research. Findings from the study will be well placed to inform policy and government priorities in relation to interventions for children who have experienced or are at risk from maltreatment. We will organise a national policy day towards the end of the grant period specifically aimed at policy makers and influencers to leverage the policy implications of the findings. 

Carers often find it a challenging experience to understand and manage their child's emotional and behavioural problems. A fuller understanding of the links between adversity and emotional development may help contextualise some of these difficulties, making them easier to manage. Previously the PI has collaborated in the production of a series of recorded CD materials for prospective adopted parents to help them understand the possible impact of adversity and trauma on psychological and neural development. (&amp;quot;Everything you always wanted to know about adoption but were afraid to ask&amp;quot;; www.adoptionuk.org). We will continue to contribute to new materials in this way to help parents and carers of children who have experienced maltreatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>641193</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BPS Children and Young People Annual Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E64E4F41-4112-4EE8-B57D-398CFAF5543B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Productive discussion following talk.

The first two of the three Annual Lectures planned were presented by Professors Kenneth Kendler and Stephen Hyman respectively. I was involved in the 2016 Lectures, co-ordinated by Prof Essi Viding, a Co-I on the ESRC grant. 
 
The field of psychiatry uncomfortably spans biological and psycho-social views of mind and behaviour. As a branch of medicine, psychiatry has long been under pressure to conform to the sort of reductive, biological model that has traditionally defined medicine. According to this biomedical model, diseases are characterized primarily in biological terms (e.g. genetic influence, molecular changes in the body's organs, abnormalities detectable via blood tests, MRI scans, etc.) As well as being a branch of medicine, however, psychiatry draws heavily on the psychodynamic tradition. This makes no reference to the biological underpinnings of mental life, concerning itself instead with psycho-social elements. Patients' mental distress, on this approach, is explained with reference to life experience and treated by reflecting on past experience and current feelings in psychotherapeutic treatment.

To date, the research has attracted interest from a wide range of related professionals (psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, family therapists and teachers). Through workshops and conferences as well as through my work in different policy and advisory forums, the research from this grant has begun to improve understanding of how childhood maltreatment impacts neuro-cognitive development in ways that can embed long term vulnerability to later mental health problems. This has begun to create a greater impetus towards preventive intervention for affected children. It also provides the basis to begin a new wave of research to refine our understanding of the specific neuro-cogntive mechanism that are implicated in increasing risk of mental health problems.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>942FD227-3425-46B1-8323-78B2BAED16AA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Only preliminary findings have been obtained as data collection for Phase 2 is currently in progress. A summary of the grant objectives were as follows:

Childhood maltreatment within the family home (physical, sexual, emotional abuse or neglect) remains a major public
health and social welfare concern and has a profound impact on the individual and on society. The main objective of this
project is to significantly extend our understanding of the range of neurocognitive correlates of maltreatment, and relate
these to future behavioural and psychiatric outcomes.
Building on the new and innovative work of my team, we are employing an interdisciplinary framework to substantially increase our knowledge of the impact of maltreatment on children.

Although we are still in the process of analysing and collected data we have developed a theory as to how early adversity gets 'under the skin' in ways that may increase vulnerability to future mental health problems. Abuse and neglect can have a negative impact on children's mental health - even many years after the event. Our research shows that children adapt to early chaotic, unpredictable or violent homes in ways that help them survive and cope. However, the biological and psychological changes associated with these adaptations come at a high price. Some children adapt to 'fit' atypical and disturbed environments in ways that are not helpful when they go out into the world to make friends, learn and develop as adults. We call this unhelpful adaptation 'latent vulnerability'. Children who have experienced maltreatment may not immediately appear to have a mental health problem, but have an underlying vulnerability that increases the risk of anxiety, depression and other disorders later in life. This 'latent vulnerability' is evident in our brain imaging findings. 

We have published a number of studies that show that brain structure and function differ in children who have been exposed to maltreatment, in ways that may increase latent vulnerability. For example, our findings have shown that maltreatment is associated with common patterns of alterations in brain structure for males and females. Specifically we found reduced volume and cortical thickness in areas involved in emotional and behavioural regulation. This suggests that males and females are impacted in a similar way at the level of brain structure, following abuse. 

Furthermore, in a recent functional study we reported differences in how maltreatment alters the way in which children process social threat. The data are consistent with the notion that threat can elicit both patterns of hypervigilance and avoidance, that may increase risk of anxiety related difficulties in the future. 

In the second part of the study we are keen to investigate the impact of adversity on autobiographical memory functioning and how altered memory functioning may relate to future mental health problems.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings suggest that maltreatment is associated with neuro-cognitive adaptations that may represent a basis for further research in being
