In attendance were the principal investigators for the University of Southampton and the University of Cambridge, the research fellows and some PhD students working on railway-induced ground vibration at the University of Southampton. The main tasks of the MOTIV project were outlined and future plans discussed, including collaboration between the two universities.

The main plans of the MOTIV research were put forward and the areas of collaboration between the research teams at Southampton and Cambridge were identified.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visits to the facilities of Pandrol (Worksop) and Centro (Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F10C5C80-51FB-4630-9A80-8211BDF23DC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The visits to Pandrol UK (Worksop) and Centro (Birmingham) were conducted in order for our research team to inspect the facilities of these companies in relation to railway research. We also intended to discuss possible means of collaboration through measurement of rail roughness, track and ground vibration (Centro) and through laboratory testing on railpads (Pandrol). At the end of these visits, all the parties were fully committed to working together, as part of the MOTIV project, with the main objective of improving our understanding of railway induced ground vibration.

All parties involved agreed to collaborate with each other. The universities of Southampton and Cambridge will develop the numerical prediction models whilst Centro and Pandrol will support us in validating these models through the use of their facilities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science &amp; Engineering Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E2377B5-F7F6-4184-B72C-E5F928E4E0AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of the University of Southampton Science &amp;amp; Engineering Festival, an exhibit was created consisting of a Lego trainset.

In particular it has been established that it is important to include the two rails separately at higher frequencies but that they can be considered together at low frequencies. The effect of the train movement has also been determined.
The nonlinear behaviour of rail fasteners has been quantified through laboratory tests. The effect of this nonlinear behaviour on the vibration of the track and ground has been assessed using theoretical models.
Simple models for piled foundations have been developed and compared with more complex models.
The models have been implemented in fast-running software for predicting ground vibration due to railways. This includes surface railways and tunnels, including twin-tunnels.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The software will be made available to the industry although not as freeware.
