Policy-makers similarly recognise this need. Thus people with learning disabilities steer research through involvement in advisory groups and commissioning, and shape and conduct research. Discussions of the potential and limitations of such inclusive research are based largely on individual reflections. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study aims to take stock by bringing people together to share experiences, debate issues and build capacity. The objectives are to produce guidance on the issues and challenges in inclusive research, develop materials and case studies of practices that are breaking down barriers, making advances and challenging orthodoxies, and generate criteria for quality in inclusive research. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three focus groups, one involving researchers with learning disabilities who lead and conduct their own research, one of researchers with and without learning disabilities collaborating as co-researchers, and one of academic researchers with experience of gathering data from or with people with learning disabilities, will each meet for a series of encounters exploring core themes and sensitive tensions emerging from all the groups. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Data from this process will inform a focus group meeting of policy makers and research commissioners and a final joint analysis of the knowledge shared and developed.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What is inclusive research?

It then addresses three broad challenges faced by inclusive researchers: (i) getting started (establishing research relationships, managing ideas, and promoting practical politics through the ethics of the research); (ii) generating and making sense of data (including the team dynamics in the conduct of the research and approaches to inclusive analysis); and (iii) making research impact (including matters of audience and transparency). The emphasis is on how inclusive researchers have responded to these challenges and how we might usefully think about them; there is no prescription in terms of how things should be done. The presentation is based in part on ESRC-funded research conducted with inclusive researchers, using a focus group dialogic approach, to get a sense of the state of the art in inclusive research and how we might understand what it means to achieve quality in research and inclusivity terms. By sharing a descriptive framework for working together generated from this research the presentation will illuminate various options for doing research inclusively and doing it well.

For the participant-researchers involved in this study this was facilitated by dialogue. Quality of the teamwork was important to the people involved and those funding them and this involves trust, openness, shared understandings, shared purposes, and finding ways of working that suit everybody. The sensitivity of the power dynamics when academic researchers and researchers with learning disabilities work together remained at the forefront of their concerns. We can better understand the ways of working using the model generated from the data which comprises formalised, improvised, support-emphasising, negotiation-emphasising, and interdependence-emphasising approaches. 



The knowledge that inclusive research generates is largely experiential, grounded knowing about the life experiences of people with learning disabilities and considered useful to them. This kind of knowledge was valued by participant-researchers as authentic, but the value of different kinds of knowledge and knowing was recognised. In terms of how inclusive research can be assessed, findings indicated the importance of relevance and interest to people with learning disabilities, their meaningful involvement, and making their lives better. Assessing the quality of inclusive research combines assessing quality of methods and partnerships, transparency of processes, and credible findings, with assessing sustainable social inclusion benefits. People involved with commissioning or doing inclusive research expect a great deal from it, including that it will create knowledge, give voice, support individual and organisations, and provide training, skills, networks. This means that evaluating its success is inevitably complex and multi-layered. Such evaluation may be guided by the 'Questions to ask oneself when judging the quality of inclusive research with people with learning disabilities' developed from the data and appended to the full report and available on the project website (www.doingresearchinclusively.org). 



The benefits of researching inclusively were seen by participant-researchers to stem from including the voice, experiences, qualities and cultural knowledge of people with learning disabilities. Problems were found to relate to barriers residing in attitudinal, social and material domains rather than within individuals. Accessing the academy and funding opportunities were particularly problematic for researchers with learning disabilities. Regardless of cultural shifts that are supportive of inclusive research, its sustainability depends on addressing these barriers.



Good science and good inclusive research practice were found to come together when the research answers important questions not answerable in other ways; when it reaches participants/communities/knowledge that otherwise could not be accessed; when it reflexively uses the insider, cultural knowledge of people with learning disabilities; when it is authentic; and when it has impact on their lives. 



The overview gained by reflecting on a range of inclusive research shows that despite advances issues of accessibility and power retain prominence, funders who support inclusive research remain limited, and research career opportunities for learning disabled researchers are few. Maintaining dialogue regarding the concept and practices of doing research inclusively is needed for further development to be sustained.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The data are archived for future use by other research.
The findings have been translated into practical guidance and so should inform future inclusive research.
The findings include criteria for judging the quality of inclusive research which can be used by those evaluating funding applications and research reports claiming a participatory or inclusive research approach.
The report is available in an accessible format and freely available so that people with learning disabilities wanting to do research, or do it better, can use the collective knowledge of those who have better doing this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A33F99B5-8851-4717-88B0-C42A12CE3D83</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.doingresearchinclusively.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
