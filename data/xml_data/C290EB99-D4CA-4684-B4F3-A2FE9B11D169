The project will examine the ways in which gender, generation and parenthood get inscribed in meanings and practices around the idea of ?the couple?.

It will use an innovative qualitative mixed methods approach, involving participants in diary writing, designing emotion maps, photo-elicitation and semi-structured interviews. These different methods aim to draw upon a broad spectrum of research senses, to access rich accounts of couples? emotional lives and everyday relationship practices.&lt;br />&lt;br />Enduring Love? is based in the Research Centre for Citizenship, Identities and Governance (CCIG), where it is connected to the Families and Relationships Programme and the Psychosocial Studies Programme.

The research project was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC RES-062-23-3056) (2011-2013) to examine the ways in which gender, generation and parenthood get inscribed in meanings and practices around the idea of ?the couple?. Our psycho-social mixed methods approach is enabling us to interrogate the ?things? and qualities that help people sustain their relationships, breaking down the dichotomy between enduring relationships of quality and good enough or endured relationships.

In this paper we will be focussing on the quantitative and qualitative findings from our survey questionnaire. This survey included three sets of questions on relationship qualities, relationship with partner and relationship maintenance, which enabled us to scope trends in behaviour and the factors which appear to signal relationship satisfaction. Open-ended questions on the likes, dislikes and things that make someone feel appreciated add to understandings on the ?relationship work? that couples do ? or don?t do ? to sustain an enduring relationship.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Request from Labour Party Policy Review</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCCAD1D5-707E-428A-A278-CC6EB59A53C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Written research evidence requested - Research Briefing and Survey Report sent

Family Systemic Psychotherapist Dr Reenee Singh worked as a researcher on the Enduring Love? project. Here she asks: How do couples and families cope with the difficulties imposed on them by the Home Office? What are the experiences of couples where one is a migrant to the UK? What are the strengths and resiliencies within such relationships? Drawing on her experience and project data she explores the ways that the experience of Asian couples may differ from their English counterparts, working to develop a more nuanced understanding of the inevitable differences between these couple relationships.

Impact and Public Engagement Report

The Enduring Love? study was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC RES-062-23-3056) to examine meanings, understandings and experiences of couple relationships, aiming to break down the dichotomy between enduring relationships of quality and good enough or endured relationships. The project capitalized on recent moves in the UK Higher Education sector and funding landscape which require impact and public engagement activities to accompany academic research. For us, this was not only a matter of tagging on external-facing activities; we wanted to embed impact and public engagement. As such, from the outset, we defined Enduring Love? as a dialogic study.

The project was initially conceived as part of a wider thematic area that was convened through Intimate Futures and Relational Lives (IFRL) Research Group, funded by The Open University. This IIFRL initiative enabled us to host a meeting to discuss the ways in which professional practice, public sector and media interests might productively come together around ideas of couple relationships. The input from this group underpinned the project proposal and reinforced our commitment to working in dialogue with such organisations and non-academic partners. Once funded, the project established a management structure that underpinned our dialogic aims. Strategy Group members included representatives from the Department for Education (Section for Family Law and Relationships), The Treasury Office, Relate, One Plus One, The Tavistock Institute, CoSRT (College of Sexual and Relationships Therapists), Marriage Care, Bristol Community Family Trust, Asian Family Counselling Service, PACE (LGBT, Project for Advocacy and Counselling and Education). At the start of the funded project, interviews were conducted with representatives from all of these key organisations. As well as enhancing the policy and practice relevance of our work, the interviews established an ongoing dialogue with these organisations, which informed the project thereafter. 

Our 'pathways to impact' were, therefore, shaped through different modes of cross-sectoral engagement. The event also used the momentum of the new political administration of the Coalition Government, to consider how potential changes in policy might affect personal relationships and families, to identify what research questions and findings would be useful to beneficiaries and in what format, and to agree the most productive ways of continuing and developing communication. Until recently, political and policy interest in family lives has tended to concentrate on supporting children and parenting practices, structured through such government initiatives as Every Child Matters (DfES, 2003), Every Parent Matters (DfCSF, 2007) and Support for All: Families and Relationships (DfCSF, 2010). Following on from the General Election (May 2010), political and media attention may be tightly focused on the economy, but concerns remain about the 'state of relationships' in Britain today. Discussion at the OU-sponsored Intimate Futures Symposium (June 2010) highlighted the coalition government's commitment to support quality relationships and maintain family stability. This highlighted the need for more nuanced understandings of relationship capability and how some relationships are managing to successfully work through the 'stressors' that are encountered during uncertain socio-economic times. The end of the project was equally well-timed, coinciding as it does with the end of this period of government. 

Dialogue with third sector organisations has thus ensured that insights generated through our study have professional practice relevance. Research evidence in this context is being used to inform delivery and development of relationship support and sex and relationship education (SRE) services. For example, we are currently working with the Family Planning Association to pilot SRE materials that are targeted at young people. We are also working closely with organisations involved in the Relationships Alliance to contribute to the development of relationship support services, through advancing understandings of what constitutes 'quality' and 'stability' in the context of long-term relationships and the emphasis placed upon these values in contemporary political rhetoric and policy thinking. The Relationships Alliance, formed of four leading relationship support organisations - Relate, Marriage Care, OnePlusOne and the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships - has, for example, suggested a range of alternative policy proposals to support couple relationships that go beyond the purely financial (RelationshipsAlliance, 2013). One of its recommendations is the targeted provision of services at those life transition points, such as unemployment, becoming a parent and retiring, that have long been recognised in academic, policy and practitioner research as 'stressors' (Walker, Barrett, Wilson, &amp;amp; Chang, 2010) that some couples struggle to cope with. We were invited to participate in the 'Relationship Summit' that was hosted by the Relationships Alliance (College of General Practitioners, London, 18 August 2014). Here, in the long run-up to the 2015 general election, Prime Minister David Cameron announced that all future domestic policies would have to pass a 'family test' that would examine their impact on family relationships. The research has also directly impacted on the democratic debate on couple relationships through invitations to participate in all-party parliamentary briefings, receptions and consultation events, including House of Commons (July 2013, April 2012 and October 2014) and Houses of Parliament (February 2013). Written research evidence was requested and has been presented to the Centre for Social Justice and Labour policy review. 

In knowledge exchange activities with stakeholder groups (clinicians and relationship support organisations), and in dialogue with researcher and psychotherapist Reenee Singh, one other area was identified for further exploitation. The emotion map method was pioneered by Gabb (2008) in her previous research on family relationships, Behind Closed Doors. Researching intimacy and sexuality in families (ESRC, RES-000-22-0854) and formed part of multiple methods palette in the Enduring Love? study. The technique is designed to generate data on the emotional dynamic of everyday experience, locating how and where relationships are enacted, in this instance at home. Having worked as a researcher on the Enduring Love? project, Singh was convinced that emotion maps could make a valuable contribution in the clinical assessment and clinical practice toolkit. The graphic depiction of events and interactions literally opens up relationships for personal (and clinical) scrutiny, with the sharing of individual emotion maps between the couple and amongst family members encouraging critical reflection on how events and emotions may be perceived and experienced differently. In collaboration, drawing on case examples from Singh's work as a systemic family psychotherapist, we have explored the applied use of emotion maps in clinical contexts (Gabb &amp;amp; Singh, 2014). 

Throughout the duration of the project we established regular communication with a wide and general audience. A regular newsletter was produced with a circulation of over 3,500 including many participants from the online survey and qualitative research. Copies of the newsletters are archived and remain available on the project website http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/communication-outputs/newsletter A collection of audio and video podcasts was also produced, being designed to introduce the study to participants and to provoke reflection among a general audience: https://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/enduring-love-for-ipod-iphone/id495106174 In these podcasts couples reflected on love and commitment, the effect of children, and the 'relationship work' which they do to sustain their relationships. The podcasts remain highly popular, receiving more than 24,000 hits in the first 3 months; they continue to offer an accessible portal into the conceptual themes developed in our academically-oriented analysis. The podcasts have a further purpose in that they provide case studies that are readily and publically available for journalists. 

There has been extensive national and international media coverage of the Enduring Love? project and its findings. Between mid-January and mid-February 2014, the study generated 135 media features including a slot on the BBC TV news channel. The extent of this coverage has moved beyond the dissemination of findings, provoking on-going policy and public debate on the impact of parenting, sexuality, and what constitutes relationship work more generally. The media coverage has been generally good although some headlines were highly selective in how they read the rich survey findings: 'British women prefer tea to sex' (South China Morning Post, Sunday 19 January 2014). The feature goes on to explain, 'small gestures of appreciation matter far more than big flash romantic displays of affectionbeing made a cup of tea by your partner is a bigger turn-on than sex, but we are talking about Britain here remember'. The academic book has now been completed (Gabb &amp;amp; Fink, forthcoming) and we have been approached by a leading publisher to write a 'trade' book from these findings, that will be marketed as 'the only relationship handbook based on research evidence'. This publication will translate the research findings into an accessible format, providing practical exercises aimed at a large international general audience.

The success of the Enduring Love? impact and public engagement strategy is perhaps best summed up by an endorsement received by Ruth Sutherland (Relate CEO), when speaking at the public launch event of the study findings (British Library, London, 14 January 2014): 

This evidence and research could really raise the national consciousness of [relationship] issues and put them firmly in the debate. I hope we will look back at today and know this is a milestone the beginning of our understanding the need to invest in this area and to generate more and more research to help.

Research findings
? Gender, parenthood, sexuality and generation appeared to shape experience but there were no defining distinctions between the data of women and men, or parents and child-free couples. However, when one or more of these variables were combined, notably gender and parenthood, differences became more marked and there was statistical significance in survey data. 
? Survey findings suggest that parents engage in less relationship maintenance than childless participants. Ratings of both relationship quality and partner satisfaction dipped for mothers and fathers during midlife, pointing to the challenges which parenthood exerts on the couple's relationship. 
? LGBTQ child-free participants scored more highly in their relationship quality and partner satisfaction than heterosexual counterparts, but it is unclear whether such rankings are due to greater reflexivity or differences in experience. Such contextual factors were further probed in our qualitative research with 50 couples. Here there was considerable diversity in relationship experience, but overall routine relationship work, good communication (verbal, non-verbal, and tacit agreements), physical affection and sexual intimacy, and investments in other people and activities beyond the couple dyad all combined to sustain the relationship project. 
? Most importantly, findings highlighted the importance of everyday relationship practices (like bringing a partner a cup of tea in bed), sharing domestic responsibilities (notably those associated with childcare) and creating couple time (through activities which foster a sense of togetherness). These 'couple practices' demonstrated individual's appreciation for their partner, the couple's commitment to the long-term 'relationship horizon' and appear to provide the emotional resources that enable couples to find a route through tough times as well as good.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Development of services and resources: relationship support; relationship education</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E9256F2-8C7D-42AE-96D5-7A01B364A461</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Emotion maps and use in clinical practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>25B592A2-41E6-4DB2-9544-83EAE036C1C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Emotion maps, as used in the Enduring Love? project, have now been added to the systemic clinicians' repertoire of visual methods.
