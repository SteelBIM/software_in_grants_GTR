From the website (http://www.niea.unsw.edu.au/events/exhibition-feral-experimental; accessed 14 Nov. 2014):

&amp;quot;Bringing together leading international practitioners and researchers Feral Experimental aims to test the limits of possibility by exploring the boundaries and intersections of experimental practice in design thinking, speculative design, participatory and co-design.

Feral Experimental sets out to explore state-of-the-art strategies for negotiating significant contemporary challenges from preparations for extreme wildfire, to energy conservation to the preservation of cultural heritage. Feral Experimental incorporates an exhibition, a symposium, workshops and a series of public lectures. The program will highlight real world applications and the impact of design methods that are currently being developed in universities and research centres.

Experimental approaches to design thinking are engaged with user experiences via cultural probes and tangible interactions that are informed by design ethnography, design anthropology, and new combinations of technology. These approaches extend data collection methods that combine sensors, cameras, and GPS tracking to measure the affect of cycling, and technologies that emulate seeing through another's eyes.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>75D2FE2F-4054-441B-8A4F-352BA54B9431</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was very well attended by a mixture of academics, practitioners and press from Design and related disciplines.

There is interest in touring this exhibition both to Carnegie Mellon and to RMIT, Melbourne. A book of edited essays based on the exhibition (and including a chapter on the Babble) is planned as well.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Feral Experimental exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.niea.unsw.edu.au/events/exhibition-feral-experimental</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Energy Babble is a kind of automated talk-radio that is obsessed with energy and the environment. A local server gathers content from a variety of online sources, including Twitter? feeds from the communities, from governmental departments, and from the National Grid, and converts text to synthesised speech, interspersed with a variety of jingles and sound effects. The audio is sent via Internet to multiple devices situated in a variety of homes and public spaces used by research participants. These devices consist of two custom blown-glass components set on top of an injection-moulded base. The base houses the device's electronic components, including a Raspberry PI microcomputer, various actuators, and a compact loudspeaker. The central glass piece serves to amplify the output of the speaker located beneath it-glass's acoustic properties make it optimal for this function-while second glass piece supports it and holds a microphone attached to the base by a coiled cable. The microphone is used to record comments to be sent back to the server, where they are converted to text and resynthesised for later broadcast. A prominent yellow knob rotates to control volume; if turned beyond its lowest setting it plays a recorded description of the system and its operation, using the same synthesised voices as the rest of the system.</gtr:description><gtr:id>552F5329-64C2-4EE7-AD1F-D64A5093E8AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Energy Babbles were deployed for over 6 months to five 'energy communities' around the UK. Here they served to bring new energy-related information into the communities and to allow communications across communities. They also served significantly to fuel conversations with the research team about the particularities of the communities activities and struggles, and their engagement with issues including but not limited to the environment.

The Energy Babble has been exhibited in exhibitions organised by Karen Henwood and Bill Gaver with support from the EPSRC. These exhibitions, titled 'A Sense Of Energy - Multimodal Encounters With Energy Communities' have been staged twice to date:
? 26 - 28 June, The White Building, Hackney Wick, London 
? 30 September - 2 October, The Senedd, Cardiff, Wales
These exhibitions reached a large and diverse audience, ranging from school children to government policy makers. We plan to publish an account of this in due course.

The Energy Babble was also included in the Feral Experimental exhibition, 18 July - 30 August, 2014 (Katherine Moline, curator) at the UNSW Galleries in Sydney, Australia. So far this has resulted in two press reviews:

- The White Building, London, 26 - 28 June 2014
- The Welsh Assembly, Cardiff, 30 September - 2 October 2014.
Each exhibition was accompanied by a variety of symposia and related events drawing audiences of around 100 - 300 people. These were a mixture of local residents, concerned citizens, researchers and (in the Cardiff case) policy makers.

Our team took responsibility for the overall exhibition design as well as the design and production of a catalog for the show. In addition, we conducted a 'Data Walking Tour' as part of the London exhibition in which participants -- reflecting the demographics above -- walked along a preplanned route with a set of geographically-linked 'big data' about the areas they were in.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancaster University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Computing and Communications</gtr:department><gtr:description>OnSupply</gtr:description><gtr:id>13DC0B97-23E6-4BBC-9C11-36557445C866</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper on our work in the project is in preparation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Lancaster group coordinated the project and mediated the collaboration with the Tiree Trust.

Most recently the Energy Babble has been included in an Australian exhibition called - Experimental Practice: Provocations In and Out of Design at Design Hub, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia, 11-30 May 2015.

This extends its antipodean presence from its original inclusion in the Feral Experimental exhibition, 18 July - 30 August, 2014 at the UNSW Galleries in Sydney, Australia, which resulted in two press reviews:
? Jess Scully, 'Radio interview: Katherine Moline - Feral Experimental at UNSW Art &amp;amp; Design', So Hot Right Now, 2SER 107.3, 26 July 2014.
? Harry Azidis, 'Going Feral', Broadsheet Sydney, 8th August 2014.
There is interest in touring this exhibition both to Carnegie Mellon and to RMIT, Melbourne. In addition, a book of edited essays based on the exhibition (and including a chapter on the Babble) is planned as well.

In the UK, Energy Babble, along with associated research materials and findings, has been exhibited in exhibitions organised by Karen Henwood and Bill Gaver with support from the EPSRC. These exhibitions, titled 'A Sense Of Energy - Multimodal Encounters With Energy Communities' have been staged twice:
? 26 - 28 June, The White Building, Hackney Wick, London 
? 30 September - 2 October, The Senedd, Cardiff, Wales
These exhibitions reached a large and diverse audience, ranging from school children to government policy makers. 

We are also actively publishing project results to audiences from several disciplines, most notably Human Computer Interaction, Sociology and Science and Technology Studies. Participants in HCI, particularly, include a significant proportion of industry researchers and practitioners.

Finally, project members have discussed the project in numerous lectures internationally. Again, because of the nature of the discipline these talks attract mixed academic and non-academic audiences:

There are several 'user' communities for this work:

1. The energy communities - our work has supplemented awareness of differences across communities, and problems of sharing 'best practice' across communities, in ways we expect to have lasting impact on their relationships. We are seeking to maximise this by post-project engagement with, e.g., the exhibitions we have staged.

2. Energy Policy community - we believe our work will raise awareness of the negative impacts of overcomplicated, inconsistent and variable policy initiatives. The exhibitions and associated lectures and workshops are the primary mechanism for achieving this impact. For instance, in Wales the 'Sense of Energy' exhbition was held in the Senedd where various policy makers encountered the displays and attended the opening symposia. We also participated in the energy exhibition at the Parliament organised by the ESRC and AHRC where we were able to discuss this research briefly with policymakers.

3. Wider public - our work has had public impact by demonstrating the complexity of issues around 'energy demand reduction' (eg the complex status of energy-related 'information'; the complexities of relations between 'energy communities'). Once again, the exhibitions have proven valuable in reaching a broader public, including school children, university students, workers in sustainability related fields, as well as general passersby.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>41AB3D34-C1A6-4921-ABE8-821AB7502467</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our findings come from a practice-based approach in which we worked with 6 - 8 'energy communities' spread across the UK. In addition to visiting the communities, we hosted an 'engagement workshop' and provided Cultural Probe kits for community members to work with at home. We developed several design workbooks and focused on the concept of an 'Energy Babble', developing this to batch-produce a set of highly-finished research devices. The Energy Babble is an audio device using synthesised speech to read out energy-related content algorithmically scraped from the web, and also inputs made by the devices' users. Twenty eight Babbles were distributed to the communities for a period of about six months, and their engagements studied through a combination of ethnographic interviews and documentary film.

Based on this work, our findings are: 

1. Energy communities are heterogeneous and struggle with policy.
Energy 'communities' are by no means coextensive with their geographical settings. Typically involving small numbers of committed members who see themselves as practitioners, innovators and transition advocates, they form and reform in response to policy and funding changes, seek to enrol the communities of their villages or towns or cities, and agonise over how they will involve more people in their plans. Some were extremely well organised and funded, while others were very ad hoc and quiet. 

Related to this, Energy communities have a very diverse set of orientations, interests and activities with regards to sustainable energy generation and demand. Although not entirely co-extensive with their geographical setting, the Energy Communities are, in part, shaped by the socio-cultural specificities of their geographical milieu. The orientations that the local communities take are typically inflected with particular engagements with on-the-ground concerns and practices such as energy literacy, agricultural uses, energy poverty, and so on. This makes forming them into larger communities or sharing knowledge and best practice problematic.

A strong message from the communities was that they see Government policies as very difficult to work with. There were several reasons for this, including their constant change and the perception that they were made overly complicated to discourage excessive participation.

2. A mixed Design- and Sociology-led methodology supported engagement with the energy communities.
Designs like the Babble can play a dual role in the communities. On the one hand, the system provided information and allowed some communication amongst participants. More importantly, it played an active role in conversations between participants and researchers, helping to reveal a great deal of information about their activities, experiences and concerns.

Similarly, design-led methods like those used in the engagement workshop and the Cultural Probes appear effective in shaping a positive, collaborative relationship with community participants who are busy, and somewhat jaded from a great deal of traditional social scientific scrutiny.

New methods were also developed and trialled as part of the project. This included the design and deployment of software research robots on Twitter - building on developments in Digital Sociology - and a Descripting workshop, where the assumptions designed into existing energy monitoring technologies was held up against actual use.

3. The internet is an emerging ecology of energy-demand reduction that can be used in design.
The Internet is a repository for a vast range of content relevant to energy conservation and production, including information about the national grid, government policy, available technologies and community practices. Social media may be a valuable source of energy-related information. Algorithmic web scraping is an effective way to find and gather this information, however filtering and organising it to align with communities' activities is a significant challenge.

The Internet is also a setting for the emergence of new energy-related practices and actors, such as the bots mentioned earlier. The Internet, including social media, can therefore be understood as a novel and emerging ecology of energy-demand reduction not reducible to an information repository or communication medium.

Product design allows technologies to be embodied appropriately in order to make the most of the concrete features of the communities and groups described above. For example, deploying a design in a school drives new forms of use by groups engaged in demand reduction, fieldwork and other activities who can respond to these emerging practices.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Academic communities - the project provides methodological examples ranging from new ways to engage participants to the use of devices to explore communities that can be used and extended by researchers and practitioners in HCI and Sociology concerned with environmental and other issues.
