It identifies and charts the careers of individual 'specials', many of whom also wrote as novelists and periodical reviewers. Characterised by a vivid, descriptive style of reportage that was criticised by some contemporary commentators as sensational, special correspondence played a key role in forming the discourses of literature and journalism at a time when the boundary between them was contested. The impact of this remains evident today in debate about the relationship between fact and fiction in the press, and in its exploration of the cultural resonance of this writing the project will help to chart the emergence of the modern mass media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from the research and how?

1. Media organisations and members of the general public, by raising awareness of the histories associated with contemporary literary and journalistic formations through the communication of my research findings in forums that cross the town/gown divide.

While the current inquiry into media ethics in Britain has been triggered by the phone-hacking scandal, it is also part of a continuing debate about the role of the press and the commercial imperatives that drive it. Controversies associated with the fabrication of published memoirs or the manufacture of news in the press over the past decade indicate that the relationship between fact and fiction in contemporary print culture remains a vexed one. Such controversies are not new: they have their antecedents in the debates about the New Journalism and the relationship between literary and newspaper narrative in the latter part of the nineteenth century, although these connections have hitherto largely gone unnoticed. My project will bring them to light and help to inform public debate about contemporary journalistic formations. For example, the arguments about 'embedded' war correspondents used in the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan may be illuminated by understanding the historical context of debate about journalists' involvement in and reportage of Victorian military campaigns. Similarly, the desire for immediacy that seems to drive developments in new media may be illuminated by recovering its history, evident in the 'word-painting' of the special correspondents.

2. Students and teachers of nineteenth-century literature and history, by imaginatively incorporating Victorian periodicals in my own teaching and contributing to wider discussion of their use in the high-school classroom through engagement with cross-sector English- and History-teaching groups.

Periodicals have long been seen as essential source or background material for the study of Victorian literature and history; but as online resources improve, teachers at both secondary and tertiary levels are increasingly attempting to weave periodicals in imaginative ways into their teaching of nineteenth-century literature and history. For example, the Dickens Journals Online project, which digitises some 1,061 tightly-printed weekly issues of 'Household Words' and 'All the Year Round', is designed to enable high-school teachers and students to access this compendium of nineteenth-century Britain for use in the classroom. I was a co-applicant for the Leverhulme grant that is funding this project, I am a member of its Editorial Advisory Board and thus I am already involved in new efforts to bring Victorian journalism into high-school classrooms. In adding to the body of knowledge available about Victorian journalism, my project will be of benefit to those using these periodicals in the classroom. Children learning History today are taught about the importance of sources and their evaluation, so my work will contribute to critical reflection upon the relationship between the press coverage of events and the historical record of them. In explicitly addressing the problematic nexus of literature and journalism and the origins of anxiety about it in the nineteenth century, my research will encourage discussion about the history of subject formations like English or Media Studies: a matter of particular relevance in the context of recent debates about the rift between the teaching of subject English in schools and in higher education.

3. Potentially, the tourism and heritage industries, by adding new culturally and historically significant knowledge to resources associated with existing sites.

In recovering the journalism associated with the travels and tribulations of such colourful special correspondents as Sala and Forbes as they crossed the globe, the project may generate material (reports, sketches) that would add interest to existing archives or tourist trails.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>167155</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Picturing the News' is an online exhibition, co-curated by Catherine Waters and Ruth Brimacombe, hosted on the University of Kent server, that celebrates the rise of a new journalistic phenomenon in the mid-19th century: the emergence of the so-called 'Special Correspondents' and 'Special Artists', and reveals them to be distinct and related documentary professions.

Although commonly associated with the reportage of war, my research has shown that these special correspondents were in fact tasked with routinely chronicling all manner of topical events, from engineering innovations, civic affairs and criminal trials to royal tours, municipal ceremonies and exhibitions as well as military campaigns at home and abroad. Having identified some 150 journalists who were said to have worked as Specials in Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century, summary information about their careers has been developed as an open access database. But I have also found that the by-line 'From Our Special Correspondent' was used imprecisely, sometimes referring merely to a specialist area of expertise (like cricket), and some journalists assumed the role only once because they happened to be on the spot when a particular event happened. A much smaller number emerged in my research as key protagonists amongst the first generation of Specials and they form the main focus of my cultural analysis. All household names in their day, they include William Howard Russell ('Times'), George Augustus Sala ('Daily Telegraph' and 'Illustrated London News') and Archibald Forbes ('Daily News').

What made them special was their capacity to fulfil the arduous demands of the role - they had to be able to function creatively under extreme pressure and deliver at speed - and the distinctive quality of their reportage: for what distinguished special correspondence was its mobility, versatility and descriptive power - an ability to observe and seize upon events wherever they happened, rendering them for the press in sufficiently graphic prose so as to transport readers to the scene described through vivid eye-witness accounts. This has led me to see that special correspondence and the journalists who wrote it are best understood as together constituting a new media technology. Like the railroad, the photograph or the telegraph, with all of which it was closely associated, special correspondence brought the world closer, shrinking space and time and conveying readers to distant places. Its practitioners were nineteenth-century media pioneers, responsible for creating the modern news culture that continues to shape our world. These findings have been developed in three book chapters to date and form the basis for the monograph - the major output from the project - that I am currently writing.

This research also led to collaboration in curating an online exhibition with Dr Ruth Brimacombe, whose work on the special artists of the period is directly complementary to my work on the special correspondents. Together we have found them to be distinct and related documentary professions distinguished by their 'first-person' perspective. For both artists and correspondents, the core value of graphic journalism lay in its ability to facilitate an affective, virtual experience of the news events they observed for readers of the metropolitan press. Our open access exhibition, 'Picturing the News: The Art of Victorian Graphic Journalism', collects together a range of examples of their work in order to demonstrate a renewed appreciation of the literary, historical and artistic significance of the graphic reportage produced by this pioneering group of journalists, who were dispatched at short notice across the globe to report back from the scene of every newsworthy event of Queen Victoria's reign.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings regarding the work of the key protagonists amongst the first generation of special correspondents and the broader cultural significance of their writing are being taken forward in the monograph I am currently writing, which will be the main scholarly output of the project. In addition, the research data summarising individual career information of identified Specials in the open access database (including events reported, newspapers and periodicals they worked for and when, other careers and publications) may be used by other researchers wanting to study the evolution of reportage in the nineteenth-century press or to find out more about any journalist who worked in this role.

The online exhibition is the main vehicle for public engagement with the project. In showcasing the work of key special artists and correspondents, it reveals that their presswork raised issues for the Victorians which still have current resonance for today's media audience, such as the desire for immediacy that drives our own 24-hour news culture; arguments about the use and influence of 'embedded' war correspondents and the complex skill of blending accurate fact with compelling detail to meet popular demand without erring into embellishment. It is being promoted on an ongoing basis through social media and talks to third-sector organisations.

Surveying their coverage of a wide range of topical events - from engineering innovations, civic affairs, parliamentary debates and judicial inquiries to royal tours, municipal ceremonies and military campaigns at home and abroad - my research shows that the work of the Specials remains a fundamental, but often overlooked, primary source for the social and cultural history of nineteenth-century Britain. I have submitted a proposal to the Schools Liaison Project run by the University of Kent for a workshop on 'Teaching and Learning Nineteenth-Century Periodicals and Newspapers using Digital Resources' which has yet to be taken up, but indicates the way in which my findings may be put to use by other educators keen to introduce new materials and approaches in the field of Victorian studies into the high school classroom.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB0B74D8-0C0E-43CC-8679-2769FB67446A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://research.kent.ac.uk/victorianspecials/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database covers the first generation of special correspondents working in Britain in the second half of the nineteenth century and also includes some special artists who provided occasional correspondence. Listing summary information regarding the careers of identified specials, including events reported, newspapers and periodicals they worked for and when, the database was developed to provide the basis for new entries in the eBook version of the 'Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism', edited by Laurel Brake, and to form a resource for the broader cultural analysis of special correspondence that is being developed in the monograph that is the major scholarly output of the project - currently in preparation. The aim was not to provide an exhaustive catalogue of Victorian special correspondents, nor to adjudicate ambiguous cases where writers pursued multiple careers (as both journalists and novelists, for example) or wrote in other genres. Instead, the aim was to gather a sufficiently comprehensive overview of the Victorian special to be able to identify recurring or characteristic features of the role and the writing associated with it. It is available as an open access resource on the University of Kent website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6DD13563-268D-42F3-8D97-61FA2D5BEF0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impacts as
