Due to the high intensities and extremely short timescales involved, the interaction of matter with intense laser fields holds the key to fundamental questions such as: How does an electron migrate in a photosynthetic molecule?How are holes created and dissipated in a solid?How does a metal melt in real time? The answer to such questions will lead not only to a better understanding of how matter evolves in this extreme regime, but also holds the promise of steering electron dynamics in real time with attosecond precision. This will have major repercussions in both fundamental and applied science, as electrons contribute to the breaking or making of chemical bonds, and are responsible for energy transport in biomolecules, solids and nanostructures. This implies an unprecedented control in light-harvesting processes and electron motion in electronic devices. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the attosecond dynamics in atoms and small molecules, both theoretically and experimentally. However, the modeling of complex systems in this regime poses a far greater challenge. An appropriate treatment of electron-electron correlation, excitation, migration and the coupling of internal degrees of freedom goes far beyond the present capabilities of the existing strong-field theories, which impose a series of major restrictions on the residual binding potentials. Ab-initio approaches, on the other hand, are inapplicable to large systems, as the numerical effort increases exponentially with the degrees of freedom involved. 

In order to face this challenge, one must develop novel theoretical approaches for multi-electron systems in strong fields that (i) do not suffer from the above-mentioned &amp;quot;exponential wall&amp;quot;; (ii) account for the core dynamics and electron-electron correlation; (iii) do not impose major restrictions on the binding potentials in the system; (iv) provide an intuitive physical picture of the phenomena to be studied in terms of electron orbits. With this in mind, we have assembled a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team, composed of leading experts in the UK whose background encompasses quantum chemistry, strong-field and condensed-matter physics, which is unified by using trajectory based methods in quantum dynamics. Our main objective is to develop the above-mentioned approaches.

In this project, we intend to extend and combine methods from quantum chemistry and condensed-matter physics with a wide range of applicability to many-body systems, such as the Coupled Coherent State (CCS) approach or the time-dependent density functional theory (tddft), to describe attosecond multielectron dynamics. We will apply such methods to concrete physical systems with increasing degree of complexity, such as one-, two- and multielectron atoms, diatomic and polyatomic molecules. The CCS will both be extended to multielectron systems, and combined with the tddft in hybrid approaches. Whenever possible, we will also develop novel analytic, or semi-analytic theories.

In the first part of this project, we will focus on one- and two electron systems and the interplay between the laser field and the binding potentials. Subsequently, we will model and study the core dynamics in multielectron systems. A detailed assessment of the differences, similarities and limitations of each approach will be made. Throughout, we will compare our results to the pioneering experiments at the Imperial College London, on HHG in organic molecules, and at the MPQ, Munich, on laser-induced nonsequential double ionization. This proposal will provide a unique set of tools worldwide for modeling attosecond multielectron dynamics, and pave the way towards the ultimate goal of controlling attosecond processes in real time. This will break new ground in physics, chemistry, biology and applied science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>(a) Scientific impact: The immediate impact will be in areas such as strong-field and attophysics, condensed-matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Theoretical strong-field scientists will profit from the wealth of methods developed, which go beyond the current Coulomb-corrected strong-field approaches. Experimentalists will benefit from the deep knowledge gained of how electron-electron correlation and the internal degrees of freedom in an extended system are influenced by a strong field. This knowledge will enable them to meet their ultimate goal of controlling matter with attosecond precision. This is a very ambitious goal, which has the potential to revolutionize physics, chemistry, biology and applied science. Electrons play a major role in photosynthesis, or man-made electronic devices. Hence, steering electron migration implies controlling light harvesting or information technologies with attosecond precision. Both areas are clearly signposted as strategic areas by the EPSRC. Furthermore, condensed-matter physicists and quantum chemists will learn how matter behaves in this extremely short, far from the equilibrium regime. Matter far from equilibrium has also been signposted by the EPSRC.

(b) Creation of synergies and building interdisciplinary research teams: This project will consolidate and strenghten the collaboration between three research groups in different areas, based in Leeds, Lancaster and UCL, and thus help build a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary team, whose expertise ranges from attoscience to condensed-matter physics to quantum chemistry. Furthermore, we will interact with leading scientists in the UK and abroad, in experiment and theory. This will increase the UK's international visibility and raise the profile of the groups involved. 

(c) Ensure the UK's competitiveness in attoscience. Item (b) is of paramount importance in order to face the international competition. In the last few years, there has been considerable growth in this area, with several appointments in Imperial and UCL, the organization of major international conferences, and an emerging attoscience group at UCL. There exist, however, whole research institutes abroad devoted to attoscience, both int theory and experiment. Hence, in order to face this competition, this growth must continue.

(d) Training of human resources in specialist and transferrable skills: Due to its strong methodological component, a great degree of training will be provided to the PDRAs involved, who will acquire a wide range of skills. First, the methods to be ulitized are employed in a wide range of areas, such as quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Second, the way such methods are combined in this proposal and their application to attoscience is unique in a worldwide scale. Hence, they will acqquire a broad and unique background. Furthermore, sampling methods and the numerical solution of differential equations are widely employed in industry and the financial sector. This will increase their employability within and beyond academia, and thus contribute to the EPSRC strategic goals of enhancing mobility between disciplines, industry and other sectors and the development of the next generation of scientists.

(e)Software development: This project will lead to a considerable development of software, which will have a very broad applicability range. We will make this software freely available to the academic community subsequently to the three years necessary to carry out the proposal. A pilot code will be provided via CF's or DS's websites, or CCP2 and CCPForge in Daresbury, and uptake will be closely monitored. Should this pilot be successful, the code will be commercialized by the company QuanteMol (see Pathways to Impact for details). This meets the EPSRC targets of fostering partnerships between industry and academia, and of making the outcome of our research available to the wider community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313960</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London (ICL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof Jon Marangos</gtr:description><gtr:id>510D2171-653C-49DD-9E68-33BA28C698E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One joint publication</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Discussions and provision of software</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Modification/extension of software</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Strong-Field Dynamics with Initial-Value Representations</gtr:description><gtr:id>D91B3774-3B9F-4B27-88E0-809D91FA4675</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration is multi-disciplinary (semi classical theory and strong-field physics).

Theory/Methodology

In the course of the project, we have successfully implemented and modified quantum-mechanical and semiclassical initial value representations (IVRs) in order to describe one-electron systems in one and three dimensions in strong fields. Examples of such approaches are the Coupled Coherent States method and the Herman Kluk propagator. We have focused on high-order harmonic generation and strong-field ionization (see Zagoya et al, New J. Phys. 16, 103040 (2014); C. Symonds, et al, Phys. Rev. A 91, 023427 (2015)). Thereby, we faced the following challenges, which were not trivial to overcome: (a) Typically, IVRs are applied in quantum chemistry, for which the electronic wave packet is initially in the continuum, while in strong-field physics it is initially bound. How to treat ionization and in particular tunnelling using such methods has been the target of considerable debate in the semiclassical community. (b) High-order harmonic generation is a coherent process building up close to the core over at least a few cycles of the driving field. Hence, apart from the problems of how to treat an initially bound wave packet with IVRs, there is the issue that these approaches degrade over many cycles of the field. We have solved problems (a) and (b) by showing that there is transmission near the potential barrier and using a reprojection technique in the CCS method to correct for this degradation. The outcome of the IVRS exhibits an excellent agreement with more standard methods such as the solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation (TDSE) in a grid.

The semi-analytical strong-field method developed by us, which was called the Coulomb Quantum-Orbit Strong-Field Approximation (CQSFA) was successfully employed to compute and analyze above-threshold ionization spectra (X. Lai, et al, Phys. Rev. A 92, 043407 (2015)) and, more recently, near-threshold fan-shaped interference structures that occur in photoelectron momentum distributions and cannot be reproduced using more established strong-field methods such as the Strong-Field Appproximation (SFA; see Lai et al, arXiv:1703.04123). We have provided a unique explanation for this effect as a holographic pattern formed by the interference of direct electron trajectories with those deflected by the residual Coulomb potential. In comparison to existing Coulomb-corrected approaches, the developed method can be applied to all scattering angles and leads to fewer cusps in the near-threshold region. Furthermore, while standard methods require a few million orbits, we are able to produce converged results with three. We are currently performing a detailed analysis of near-threshold interference patterns in Above-threshold Ionization (ATI) using the Herman Kluk propagator and the CQSFA, and a publication is in preparation. This, together with the research below, has prepared the ground for studying two-electron systems using the CQSFA, which will be done in the next few months.

Applications

Laser-Induced Nonsequential Double Ionization: Simultaneously, we have investigated interference in correlated two-electron systems using the SFA, in the context of recollision-excitation with subsequent ionization (RESI). In this case, an electron is freed by tunnel ionization, propagates in the continuum and it is driven back by the field towards its parent ion. This recollision promotes a second electron to an excited state, from which it subsequently tunnels. We have provided theoretical evidence that quantum interference in RESI is much more robust than previously expected, and may survive integration over many degrees of freedom and even focal averaging (A.

Maxwell and C. Faria, Phys. Rev. A 92, 023421 (2015) and Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 143001 (2016)). This interference stems from different events and from several intermediate channels. These effects may be controlled by an appropriate pulse choice. In order to explain current experiments (M. Kubel et al., New J. Phys. 16, 033008 (2014)), however, we had to introduce ad hoc phases and amplitudes to account for the absence of the Coulomb potential. Since, formally, the second electron can be described in the same way as ATI, we are ready to apply the CQSFA to this problem and develop a more rigorous approach.

Plasmonically enhanced HHG: Recently, it has been suggested that plasmonic enhancements in systems such as nanostructures may enhance the HHG conversion efficiency and maximal harmonic order in several orders of magnitude. With this aim in mind, and taking into account that spatially inhomogeneous fields are potentially a good testing ground for our methods, we have used the TDSE, classical-trajectory methods and analytical models to investigate such systems in reduced-dimensionality models with effective potentials employed in the literature. We have shown that the features encountered can be explained using Mathieu's equation, so that the wave packet in the strong field can be loosely viewed as an ensemble of classical particles in a radio-frequency trap (C. Zagoya, et al, Phys. Rev. A 93, 053419 (2016)). This work, however, has called into question the present simplified models and shown that a full macroscopic description of the problem will be necessary. We are currently in a good position to deal with this problem, as we have also worked on the macroscopic propagation of HHG.

HHG propagation: In collaboration with Prof. Marangos's group at the Imperial College London, we have investigated the macroscopic response of HHG, with the aim of steering the motion of an electron using orthogonally polarized laser fields. We have shown that appropriate propagation conditions can suppress or enhance particular electron orbits, and thus be used to extract and control the angle with which an electron returns to its parent ion (T. Das, et al, Phys. Rev. A 92, 023406 (2015)). We intend to investigate propagation in other media and propagation geometries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>(a) Academic impact: The immediate impact will be in areas such as strong-field and attophysics, condensed-matter physics, and quantum chemistry. Theoretical strong-field scientists will profit from the wealth of methods developed, which go beyond the current Coulomb-corrected strong-field approaches. Experimentalists will benefit from the deep knowledge gained of how electron-electron correlation and the internal degrees of freedom in an extended system are influenced by a strong field. This knowledge will enable them to meet their ultimate goal of controlling matter with attosecond precision. This is a very ambitious goal, which will revolutionize physics, chemistry, biology and applied science. In fact, electrons play a major role in photosynthesis, or man-made electronic devices. Hence, steering electron migration implies controlling light harvesting or infromation technologies with attosecond precision. Both areas are clearly signposted as strategic areas by the EPSRC. Furthermore, condensed-matter physicists and quantum chemists will learn how matter behaves in this extremely short, far from the equilibrium regime. Matter far from equilibrium has also been signposted by the EPSRC.

(b) Creation of synergies and building interdisciplinary research teams: This project will consolidate and strenghten the collaboration between three research groups in different areas, based in Leeds, Lancaster and UCL, and thus help build a multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary team, whose expertise ranges from attoscience to condensed-matter physics to quantum chemistry. Furthermore, we will interact with leading scientists in the UK and abroad, in experiment and theory. This will increase the UK's international visibility and raise the profile of the groups involved.

(c) Ensure the UK's competitiveness in attoscience. Item (b) is of paramount importance in order to face the international competition. In the last few years, there has been considerable growth in this area, with several appointments in Imperial and UCL, the organization of major international conferences, and an emerging attoscience group at UCL, which is in the process of consolidation. There exist, however, whole research institutes abroad devoted to attoscience, both int theory and experiment. Hence, in order to face this competition, this growth must continue.

(c) Training of human resources in specialist and transferrable skills: Due to its strong methodological component, a great degree of training will be provided to the PDRAs involved, who will acquire a wide range of skills. First, the methods to be ulitized are employed in a wide range of areas, such as quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. Second, the way such methods are combined in this proposal and their application to attoscience is unique in a worldwide scale. Hence, they will acqquire a broad and unique background. Furthermore, sampling methods and the numerical solution of differential equations are widely employed in industry and the financial sector. This will increase their employability within and beyond academia, and thus contribute to the EPSRC strategic goals of enhancing mobility between disciplines, industry and other sectors and the development of the next generation of scientists.

(d)Software development: This project will lead to a considerable development of software, which will have a very broad applicability range. We first intend to make this software freely available to the academic community subsequently to the three years necessary to carry out the proposal. A pilot code will be provided via CF's or DS's websites, or CCP2 and CCPForge in Daresbury, and be closely monitored. Should this pilot be successful, the code will be commercialized by the company QuanteMol. This meets the EPSRC targets of fostering partnerships between industry and academia, and of making the outcome of our research available to the wider community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8B64CE33-824B-4C5B-A7FC-B30CCA35307B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
