There are a number of disadvantages to batch processing: large amounts of material are committed to each stage; failure can cause loss of the entire batch; there can be large variations in batch repeatability; and it is difficult to scale-up to larger volumes due to limitations on heat flow. Continuous flow manufacture in pipelines offers significant improvements over batch processing: continual processing of small volumes reduces risks in process failures; it is greener technology because it produces less waste; throughput can be increased; capital and running costs are lower; higher surface areas make it easier to heat and cool processes. A grand challenge in implementing continuous flow manufacture is handling of solids, in particular nucleation of fine crystals. Properties of the solid, such as size, shape and internal structure of crystals have enormous effects on their suitability, e.g., as drugs, pesticides, fertilizers. These properties can be difficult to control. Mixing and shear changes the fluid's readiness to grow crystals.

Our research programme aims to improve on current methods for crystallisation in continuous flow by using short, intense pulses of laser light to induce nucleation at specific points and times in the tubes of a continuous flow reactor. So far our laser-induced crystallisation method has been studied in the laboratory using only static sample vials and droplets. We therefore need to study our technique under mixing and flow conditions. Our objective is to demonstrate that our method can grow crystals at different locations where the fluid conditions favour certain crystal shapes, sizes and structures. Such techniques are not already available to industry. Even fractional improvements through this method could yield substantial improvements in the quality of solids, and could encourage industry to switch to continuous flow for more processes. Of course we do not claim that this will be a magic bullet to solve all challenges for continuous manufacture of high-value solids. However, we believe that the technique could stand to make significant savings and improvements in some processes, e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry.

To make our programme relevant to the needs of industry, our project will embark on collaboration with a recently formed consortium for Continuous Manufacture and Crystallisation (CMAC). This group have secured significant investment through government (EPSRC), seven universities, three top-tier global-scale manufacturers (GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca, Novartis), and another 28 industrial partners. CMAC aims to accelerate the adoption of continuous manufacturing processes, systems and plants for the production of pharmaceuticals and fine-chemicals to higher levels of quality, with lower costs, more quickly, and in a more sustainable manner. Our collaboration will ensure that industry leaders have fast and direct access to the outcomes of our research programme.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct academic impacts of the proposed research include a deeper knowledge of the fundamental chemistry and physics of nucleation under flow conditions. Understanding gained from this work may be extended to diverse branches of science where nucleation is important, e.g., atmospheric condensation, biocrystallisation, ice formation.

Direct economic impacts include making available a new technique for solid particle formation under flow conditions for continuous manufacture. The research outcomes will enable manufacturers to implement new continuous flow processes, or to improve existing processes. Such improvements will lead to reduced capital and running costs, reduced process risks, enhanced sustainability, and enhanced product quality. These improvements will be beneficial to manufacture industries such as the pharmaceuticals (e.g., drug production), agrochemicals (such as pesticide), and food industry (e.g., ice formation).

The academic and economic impacts extend to wider societal issues, e.g., predicting cloud condensation and aerosol formation in the atmosphere for weather prediction, and enhanced manufacturing output leading to greater employment and wealth-creation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145277</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>GSK collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>81EA16F9-5F93-43A4-90A5-4A1359A3BC21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of collaboration agreement and application for Impact Acceleration Award funding (reported elsewhere).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge exchange, access to information.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Knowledge exchange.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing for Continuous Manufacturing and Crystallisation (CMAC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CMAC</gtr:description><gtr:id>88CABF06-1CAA-494C-832D-D3E34C329CA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DOI: 10.1021/acs.cgd.5b00854

A key object for our engagement activities has been to broaden participation in science and higher education from students particularly in areas with small schools. We participated in celebrating the International Year of Crystallography (www.iycr2014.org) in 2014, and the International Year of Light (www.light2015.org) in 2015. Events that we supported included outreach to Midlothian schools, 'Meet the Expert' events at the National Museum of Scotland, and workshops at Edinburgh International Science Festival.
The aim of our impact plan has been to offer control of nucleation for enhanced production of fine chemicals. The research funding has enabled us to engage directly with global pharmaceutical companies. According to the Chemical Industries Association, the UK pharmaceutical sector contributes over &amp;pound;20bn in exports. We have recently (2015) begun to demonstrate economic impact through an Impact Acceleration Funding grant, partnered with global pharmaceutical company GSK. Laboratory validation of our laser nucleation method in flow has proved to be successful, including a target currently undergoing Phase III trials.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F02B7DAC-7D74-413B-85F8-69BF268B9B8D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overarching aim of our EPSRC-funded (Manufacturing with Light) research project was to demonstrate application of short laser pulses to manufacture of solid crystals in continuous-flowing process streams. We built and successfully tested a laboratory-scale tubular reactor to achieve this, obtaining valuable new information in the design (e.g., construction materials) and operation parameters (e.g., flow rates) required. We demonstrated control over the number and size of product crystals for simple inorganic salts, e.g., ammonium chloride (used in fertilizers) and small organic molecules, e.g., urea (used in medicines and cosmetics). Some of these results have yet to be published in full. A new technique for inducing nucleation near surfaces has set new benchmarks for spatial (within 2 nanolitres) and temporal (within 5 ns) control of crystal nucleation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Techniques developed in our research group, funded through this project, will be of interest to researchers and process engineers interested in on-demand nucleation of crystal solids. Control of nucleation in this way can directly affect product crystal properties, such as size distribution, crystal morphology and polymorph. During the project, through our collaboration with EPSRC Centre for Continuous Manufacture and Control (CMAC), we have used several opportunities to demonstrate our research with global pharmaceutical companies, such as GSK, AstraZeneca, Novartis and Bayer. We are currently applying our methods to nucleation in small droplets through an Impact Acceleration Award (jointly with GSK).
