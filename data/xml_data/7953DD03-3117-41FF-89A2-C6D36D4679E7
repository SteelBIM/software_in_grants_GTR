The engineering core of this project couples an array of carefully selected, physics-based models to support investigation of how stormwater cascades through a city's drainage system, accounting for the dynamics of not just water, but also sediment, debris, natural solutes and contaminants carried by urban runoff. Based on the capability of this suite of models to simulate water flow, storage and quality within an urban system, we will investigate how the performance of grey systems (composed mainly of lined channels, pipes and detention tanks) can be improved by adding Blue-Green Infrastructure and Sustainable Drainage System (SuDS) to create treatment trains designed to manage both the quantity and quality of urban runoff. Models and design solutions will be developed and tested in the contexts of retro-fit (as part of urban renewal and uplift in Newcastle-upon-Tyne) and new build (as part of creation of a 'garden city' in Ebbsfleet, Kent). Our intent is to work out and demonstrate how resilience to floods and droughts can be achieved using integrated systems of Blue-Green and Grey assets, no matter how climate changes in future, assuring continuous, long term service delivery. 

The work will adopt throughout a whole systems perspective that recognises interdependencies with other urban systems, including transport, energy and land-use. This will identify new opportunities for managing stormwater as a resource that will then be explored. This will add to the multi-functional benefits of using Blue-Green infrastructure to manage flood risk by increasing water security. Possibilities range from non-potable uses in homes or commercial buildings (based on rainwater harvesting) to irrigating green infrastructure (e.g. street trees), managing subsidence in clay soils, soil moisture enhancement and groundwater recharge. Wider benefits may extend to local energy generation using drainage infrastructure (i.e. micro-hydropower) and enhancement of urban watercourses and ecosystem services. 

The models and protocols developed will form the basis for assessment of the potential for the optimised combinations of Blue, Green, Grey and smart infrastructure to deliver multiple-benefits in UK cities nationwide.

However, the goal of optimising urban flood and water management can only be achieved through a deep understanding citizen and community preferences with respect to managing flood risk. In short, engineering solutions must be better informed and explicitly accounted for in urban planning and development at all spatial scales. For this reason, our research will extend to investigation of the planning, development and organisational systems that govern urban flood risk management. This will be addressed using Participatory Action Research and Social Practice Theory to examine the attitudes and responses of citizens and communities to innovation in flood and water management, with the context of urban planning. 

This aspect of the work is essential to underpin and enable implementation of the engineering analyses and solutions identified in the core research outlined above.

The mechanism for bringing together engineering, social and planning components of the project will be co-location research in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and Ebbsfleet, Kent. Team research in these case study cities will establish how barriers to innovation can be overcome despite uncertainties in future urban climates, land-use, development and political leadership. Critical engagement with planners, developers and land-owners throughout the project will feed back and inform the core engineering focus of the work, building on the current trend towards the development of urban infrastructure observatories to explore responses to the innovative changes needed to achieve urban flood resilience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT AND HOW
This project has the potential to enable a step change in protecting UK cities and the national economy against risks due to increased storminess caused by climate change, without constraining urban renewal and development. It can do so by envisioning and making deliverable a different water future: one based on resilient cities where flood and water management is planned, developed, designed and operated in ways that are truly sustainable. Our international networks and profiles mean that, as our new science emerges, it will be brought to the attention of the city leaders and populations not only in the UK, but worldwide. 
Knowledge, insights and understanding of urban flood resilience generated by the consortium will be useful not only to organisations and practitioners responsible for urban flood risk management, but also people living and working in cities throughout the UK and beyond, including Councilors, voters who elect them, tax payers who fund flood risk management and people and communities at risk of flooding. 
We will convey our findings in ways accessible to professionals and decision makers, as well as the people and communities they serve. Specific impact groups include: 

SOCIAL IMPACTS 
Civic society and governance: 
Enhanced Planning policy 
Sustainable Urban Growth &amp;amp; Development 
Improved Public Health and Well-being

Flood and Water Citizenship 
Enriched Quality of Life

ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS
Urban economies:
Reduced Flood Losses and Business Disruption
Multiple benefits between floods from Blue-Green infrastructure, spaces and corridors
Increased Water Security
More productive Workforce
Competitive edge over rival cities that are not flood resilient, regionally, nationally and globally

Urban environments:
More urban green spaces and corridors
Managed flooding during extreme events that exceed capacity of piped/surface drainage system
Improved water quality
Improved air quality 
Reduced urban heat island effects
Improved soil and soil water quality
Higher resilience to drought

WHEN THEY WILL BENEFIT
From the outset, impacts will extend outside academia because policy makers, planners, developers, engineers and communities in Bristol, Newcastle and Ebbsfleet will be actively engaged in our research. Our use of social networks plus blogs, webinars, press briefings and appearances on the broadcast media will: i) reduce the lag between production of new knowledge and impact outside academia, and ii) enable us to inform debate in real time on how to make cities flood resilient places where people live better and work more productively. 

ARE OUR PATHWAYS TO IMPACT REALISTIC?
Our capacity to use social networks and media to disseminate our findings and engage with stakeholders, practitioners and publics outside academia may be demonstrated by hard data from the Blue-Green Cities Research Consortium, which includes seven of the eleven investigators and four of nine RAs from the team for this proposal. That consortium has generated public impact through its: 
1. open-registration dissemination events in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland;
2. website (36,372 visits to date, by 28,706 unique visitors); 
3. Wikipedia page (13,202 views); 
4. LinkedIn group (169 members); 
5. Twitter feed (834 followers); 
6. Blogs (4,690 views, 3,784 different visitors), 
7. FactSheets (614 downloads of 16 sheets since Feb. 2015, with 8 more in prep.).

It is our ambition in the new consortium to use experience gained during the Blue-Green Cities project to increase the numbers people outside academia that engage and interact with us by at least one and perhaps two orders of magnitude.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>511139</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P004180/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
