Sustainability</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I033351/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>By 2050 the global industrial system is committed by international agreements and governments to double its output while only using 50% of current resources and generating no more than 20% of current CO2. Achieving this represents an exciting new industrial revolution, requiring new approaches and new thinking which we term collectively Industrial Sustainability .The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Industrial Sustainability will work closely with leading companies of all sizes and from all sectors who are already actively preparing for this challenge. The Centre will work on two fronts: rapidly reducing the resource &amp;amp; energy-intensity in the production of existing goods while simultaneously investigating options for a radical redesign of the industrial system. We will build a foundation of projects in 'eco-efficiency' (creating more value using less resource by focussing on reducing use of energy, water and materials), in 'eco-factory' (for example using waste from one process as inputs to another wherever possible), and in 'sustainable industrial system' (conserving resources by for example using solar income, re-distributing what gets made where and re-assessing what and how value is delivered). As we better understand what works and what doesn't, we will develop and deliver tools and techniques, which will be used, by our collaborators to achieve their sustainability goals. Some of these tools will be commercialised and some will be made more freely available. Manufacturers of all types will use these tools to reduce the amount of energy, water and material they use to produce each product. We will work with producers of cars, food, furniture, detergents and many other products to make sure our tools are useful to as many manufacturers and sectors as possible.When we know that the tools do help to improve performance we will broadcast their existence to multiple manufacturers through our network and partners; we will measure how useful the tools are and publish that information on-line.During the 5-year initial life of the Centre we will train over 80 people to the highest standard, preparing them to be academics and practitioners with the leadership skills capable of helping industry rise to the challenge of sustainability</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries are the 100's of UK manufacturers currently seeking to improve their sustainability performance, and the 1000's who will do so in the future. They will benefit from a deeper understanding of what works and what doesn't and from the many tools that the Centre will be building. Our immediate collaborators will benefit first, quickly followed by the official members of our network and then the wider set of UK manufacturers. We expect our collaborators, many of whom are international companies, to take the knowledge and tools across their own companies and own supply chains, therefore reaching out globally. The tools and techniques we develop are intended to be developed in such a way that they are effective across multiple business sectors and business sizes. We have the Carbon Trust, the EEF and the TUC as collaborators to help increase the speed with which the wider group learn of our outputs and to increase the take up of the tools. We will also work with commercial partners who will increase tool use by developing professional versions and taking them to market. The benefits will be felt by practitioners as reduced environmental impact per unit produced (such as energy, water, waste impacts), reduced cost, improved reputation (both with peers and potentially with customers) and improved staff motivation. Reduced environmental impacts directly translates into a healthier, safer and greener environment for all citizens. Customers will also have an increasing ability to purchase goods made with a lighter footprint. It is hoped that companies with superior industrial sustainability performance will win more customers, and benefit economically from that, as well as contribute to high added value manufacturing employment. There is also some potential for re-locating manufacturing jobs into the UK as business's seek to reduce their impacts (by reducing transportation, by local sourcing, by using local company's wastes). The reduction of levels of energy and resources will also contribute to the resilience and future security of the UKs economy. The insights provided by the research base should also inform industrial and business policy makers in the identification of areas for focus</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5233278</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A card game that is played by 2-8 people from families.

An array of factory facility asset data has been collected by the manufacturer with the goal of measuring and comparing energy efficiency to identify potential savings across 6 of their factories. Specific analysis targets include a comparison of 'power factors' to identify energy consumption patterns and measure factory environmental performance.
This case study has been used to highlight Centre involvement with industry and has been made available as a hand out at events as well as on the Centre website which has resulted in requests for information about other businesses can get involved with Centre research.

A comparison across the factories highlights a performance variation of 50% which when weighted based on production suggests that even the largest producers can improve their environmental performance. Top-down analysis can be a helpful way of revealing high-energy consumers and patterns when comparing multi-level assets and resources across factories. In addition, the analysis of power factors (an often forgotten energy variable) is a useful indicator to potential energy saving opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at Sporting Goods Manufacturing Forum</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C7910AF-CF1A-4DA6-A0EB-7A7285511529</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Steve Evans and Dai Morgan participated in the World Federation Sporting Goods Industry (WFSGI) Manufacturing Forum 2014, 'How can design and manufacturing embrace?' at the Porsche Centre in Leipzig Germany on 13 - 14 November.

Abstract: Application of sustainable design is growing rapidly as companies face increasing pressure to address the environmental impacts of their products. In response, a great deal of research has been directed at the development of sustainable design methods, as early design intervention has the potential to generate radical improvements. At present however, sustainability is often considered as an afterthought, only yielding incremental improvements. As such there is a clear need to redesign our design processes, and promote embedded consideration of sustainability throughout from the earliest stages.

This webinar presents research investigating how sustainability considerations could be systematically incorporated into product design processes. The project developed a framework to help companies gain an understanding of the challenges and opportunities for the implementation of sustainable design in their own business through a systematic investigative method described in the webinar. By using this framework a company can identify targeted and customised opportunities for improvement of sustainable design, expand understanding of their processes and products, and evolve towards a situation in the future where sustainability considerations are an embedded part of their design process -towards 'Ubiquitous Sustainability' in design.
During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration. All webinars resulted in requests for further information from the attendees and helpful discussions about the research presented and how it can be applied in industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.industrialsustainability.org/publications-videos/webinars/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PhD Researcher Ergun Gungor Looks at Changeover Processes in Unilever Factories</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54FA3719-3B22-4C88-8405-5BE90E8126A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Analysis of Changeover Processes in Unilever Factories

PhD researcher Ergun Gungor has been visiting Unilever factories over the past 6 months to learn about changeover operations in manufacturing firms. The first visit was to a personal care factory in Missouri, USA where Ergun investigated the economic and environmental impacts of the factory's changeover operations as well as the root causes of these impacts and the factors that escalate them. The second visit was to Cikarang in Indonesia where he observed changeover operations in two personal care factories and one ice-cream factory over a period of one month. In all his visits Ergun observed similar factors about changeovers as well as a variation in performance between different sites. He will use the data collected to highlight the root causes of changeover impacts and how to prevent or reduce them. He also will develop a model to reveal the true cost of a changeover.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> Steering meeting on cement industry sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A43C8865-F6ED-4F17-AE15-5AEA4AB295CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>IfM members met with representatives from Department of Business Energy Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BEIS), Hanson UK and Lafarge Holcim to discuss opportunities to reduce the environmental impact of the cement industry.

Abstract: In the current global climate of declining fossil fuel reserves and due to the impact of industry on the natural environment, industrial sustainability is becoming ever more important. However, sustainability is quite a vague concept for many, and there are a range of interpretations of the word. If the resource efficiency of a factory is taken as a measure of its sustainability, then the concept becomes better defined and quantifiable. In order to analyse the resource efficiency of a factory and suggest improvements, all flows through the manufacturing system need to be modelled. However the factory is a complex environment, there is a wide variation in the quality levels of energy as well as the composition of material flows in the system. The research presented in this webinar aims to show how the thermodynamics-based concept of 'exergy' can be used to quantify the resource efficiency of a factory. This is supported by three case studies in different industries that demonstrate the practical application of exergy analysis.
During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration. All webinars resulted in requests for further information from the attendees and helpful discussions about the research presented and how it can be applied in industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.industrialsustainability.org/publications-videos/webinars/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Building Future Leaders - CIS Annual Cohort Retreat January 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E4DC498-5109-4C8F-8E9F-A187EE7F01D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through the Cohort Development Programme the Centre is meeting its goal to increase the capacity for change, by developing researchers who not only have deep technical skills derived from their research, but a broader understanding of business and sustainability. This understanding cannot be built solely from textbooks, papers and laboratories, but is strengthened and deepened by engaging with practice, exchanging with peers and broadening horizons of experience.
In order to support these needs the Centre developed the cohort programme, bringing together students of manufacturing, design and industry with a common interest in sustainability. The cohort development programme is there to support research students from across Centre institutions and from the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (DTC) in Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing, but we have welcomed members from across the UK and the international research community. 
Over the last 5 years, the programme has provided a range of opportunities for researchers to gather and engage in activities to improve their research practice, build networks and expand personal horizons. Events have ranged from research practice - helping understand the tool building process - to communication skills, practicing how to communicate research ideas succinctly to industry. The community has also exploited social media such as Facebook to maintain contact between events and share the latest news and conferences. The cornerstone of the programme is an annual retreat which brings students, researchers, senior academics together to develop shared understanding, and personal vision for their role in the future of manufacturing.

Driven by a continuous improvement spirit, the company already had notable achievements in waste recycling and process improvements. Altro provides a variety of flooring options to its customers and there is a significant burden to its manufacturing operations through changeover impacts. As the number of changeovers increases the environmental and economic impacts associated with the changeovers will lower Altro's sustainability performance. Therefore, it was a key objective to improve changeover performance by targeting these impacts.
This case study has been used to highlight Centre involvement with industry and has been made available as a hand out at events as well as on the Centre website which has resulted in requests for information about other businesses can get involved with Centre research. 


Our findings suggest that Altro could improve their changeover performance drastically by following several short-term low cost solutions and a few medium-high cost long term solutions. In order to improve changeover performance, Altro will pursue the suggested changes, while building on this preliminary study. Changeover operations require embracing a continuous improvement approach and consideration of changeover processes within the product and process innovation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on Eco-efficiency in Production</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F56811B6-480D-4DB8-99BA-D3A652BC0E0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was for industrial practitioners on behalf of the Institute of Environmental Management &amp;amp; Assessment (IEMA) and was aimed at practitioners active and interested in the eco-efficiency of their production processes.

They joined Centre Director and project Principal Investigator, Prof Steve Evans and Co-Investigator Dr Nazia Mintz-Habib, as well as several other Centre researchers. During the morning session the group used the Cambridge Value Mapping Tool to identify new value opportunities in the services provided by the SME Foundation from a stakeholder-network perspective. In the afternoon, the Service Analysis Tool was used to analysis the financial autonomy of the SME Foundation in Bangladesh from a policy making perspective.

The workshop provided participants with an in-depth exploration into the complex structure of the SME Foundation and its relationships with various stakeholders. Structured routes to engaging in more effective policy-making were identified to promote open-innovation by the SME Foundation in the Bangladeshi agri-tech industry. In total, 21 potential value opportunities were generated. Cambridge researchers benefited from the opportunity to assess the applicability of two existing tools in a policy-making context in a developing country. Anticipated future activities include a follow-on workshop in Bangladesh with an extended group of participants that fully represent the network of stakeholders to fully explore potential business model innovations using other Centre tools.

Abstract:This webinar demonstrate the role that sensing technologies can play in providing real time data to improve environmentally-aware short term decision making. The talk is in three parts: 1) A general overview of eco-intelligent manufacturing, and its widespread applicability to industry; 2) The novel use of vision sensors for reducing the duration of clean-in-place processes (relating to the food sector); 3) The novel use of laser diffraction for ensuring optimised production of thin film solar cells. The webinar therefore cover a mixture of theory and experimental investigation which should be thought provoking and lead to an engaged discussion regarding the role of eco-intelligent manufacturing in modern industry.
During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration. All webinars resulted in requests for further information from the attendees and helpful discussions about the research presented and how it can be applied in industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.industrialsustainability.org/publications-videos/webinars/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>M.

Due to the large number of industries and favelas in the basin, the project emphasises collaboration to the development of innovative solutions and frameworks for sustainable business models.

Steve and Paulo helped the project by designing and defining its scope, strategies and next phases; providing feedback about the materials and methodologies that will be used in the acceleration process; meeting with the sponsors, namely the Newton Fund from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office; and, together with a professor from Newcastle University (Jos&amp;eacute; Esteban Castro) and members of FA.VELA, they conducted the kick-off workshops. These workshops consisted of a seminar for a broader audience and 2 days of intensive work exclusively with low-income entrepreneurs to design their businesses and to find new opportunities for sustainable value.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KIST Head office</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>28DE3C08-FE67-4665-B066-34EA741ADC8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To discuss the international collaboration

This is achieved by training students with fresh knowledge and introducing them to factories, encouraging active participation in solving real problems through the application of knowledge and intuition.

An initial pitch was made to over 100 students in a Cardiff Sixth Form college, introducing the programme and highlighting the current challenges industry is facing and the opportunities for them to engage with and tackle some of these as part of the programme and their future career. 34 students were then involved in a week long programme of activities, including self directed study, a training session lead by Centre researchers and an industry engagement day. The training day involved presentation of the context of industrial efficiency and sustainability which was followed by an introduction to tools and lenses which help to identify waste in industry. They were then tasked with applying these tools to the school building and presenting improvement plans to the school staff. It is expected that a number of the recommendations would be taken forward by the college.

The industry day, was hosted by Altro who provided careers oriented presentation and detailed introduction to their product and processes. Students executed plans they had developed, based on their experiences on the training day and the independent research. They were toured around the factory with Altro staff and developed improvement plans based on the observations. They will work independently, presenting a report on their observations, including an improvement plan presentation back to a panel including senior CIS staff, the trainers, and Altro representatives. This programme is designed to have impact in of itself, but is also designed as a pilot programme for a scalable industry / schools engagement programme. Follow up review activities are in place to develop a scaling model for the programme.

Collaborators TYF, EEF Wales and doctoral researchers and Eng D students from Warwick and Cardiff MET were also involved, in addition to researchers and staff from University of Cambridge, CIS.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>GTC-K Green Technology Centre</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>152C8515-9887-48E7-9A16-A70635DCE7A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To discuss the international collaboration

Abstract: Due to the increasing demands for integrating sustainability within business, manufacturing firms are paying more attention to improve their performance in terms of economic, environmental and social criteria. Several authors have hinted the importance of maintenance to achieve more sustainable performance but no comprehensive empirical study has been done yet. This research contributes to the understanding on how maintenance can support the achievement of more sustainable performance in manufacturing industry.

During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration.

Key aspects of the manufacturing system were identified through material flow modelling. It was identified that resource consumption was variable during product changeovers and that there was potential for inefficiency and a significant opportunity to lessen environmental impact. The study outlined two initial options for material flow improvement, firstly through resource efficient scheduling and secondly through resource efficient assembly.

Abstract: Little research has addressed the impact of marketing communication messages on consumers' pro-environmental behaviours, especially when it comes to actual behaviour rather than just attitudes or intentions, therefore this research is concerned with identifying which marketing communication interventions and mechanisms can influence pro-environmental behaviour change outcomes across different contextual factors.
During the webinar attendees asked questions about the research presented to further understand the implications and potential for collaboration.

Tools to improve engineers knowledge of sustainable manufacturing practices are being used inside Airbus, while our tools to support system level change are being used by Saitex, Brandix, MAS Holdings and Nike, helping to create long term plans that move these companies toward industrial sustainability. 

Toyota have used our findings to modify their CSR reporting, investigating how the vehicle end of life process will change in a more circular environment (e.g. investigating the return logistics and supply chains partnerships; experimenting with the access to high value materials). 

IfM ECS are utilising our tools to enable their consultants to carry out interventions in SMEs and large organisations. To reduce energy, waste and water use and costs. ECS are also converting some tools into open educations and training programmes to educate the managers and engineers of companies across the UK and Europe. 

Our energy and waste flow modelling is being used by the specialist consultancy company Ecopare to carry out analysis of performance and promote improvement recommendations at Jaguar Land Rover and other companies.

Third sector organisations such as WRAP and the Flemish network PlanC are using our research in their own organisations. We work closely with other industry organisations such as iema, EEF, 2degrees and others to make our tools and methods available to their members. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funded the PrISMS project which has used our tools in their engagement with 120 SMEs in the Eastern Region of the UK to improve their sustainability performance. 

We have supported research that is taking the message concerning non-labour resource productivity into the policy process and had a successful debate and launch inside parliament. We have supported all-party parliamentary group inquiries into re-manufacturing and resource management.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>89E2C83E-84FB-4D1E-BA96-A6F2F77704BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>At the Centre for Industrial Sustainability we do research firstly into how manufacturers can improve the resource efficiency of their operations now (and with limited budget), we also build the tools and technologies that industry will need over the next 10 years, and finally we study the future shape of sustainable manufacturing. This 3 part research agenda is based on our view that all our research should be both practical and systemic - having a route to practice while understanding that all manufacturing occurs within a complex system. The Centre's research and the tools we build are already helping leading edge manufacturers and those who are new to the subject. 

Through our research into resource efficiency we have discovered the extreme levels of resource efficiency variance that can occur across factories and calculated that halving the gap between worst and best would deliver &amp;pound;10Bn more profit to UK manufacturers and save 27MTCO2e (4.5% of UK emissions) and provide 300,000 new jobs. Our research into the rapidly evolving industrial experiments with new business models that are occurring in practice has revealed a new way to analyse business models using a construct that we term 'failed value exchange'. We have also mapped as many novel sustainable business models as possible and found a series of archetypical structures that can be used by industry to build their own future business model designs. Our research into system level innovation has revealed a series of principles and patterns of those principles which help to explain fundamental differences between approaches to industrial sustainability that have external similarities (such as eco-industrial parks and industrial symbiosis). Research into the key competences needed for systemic industrial sustainability change has revealed four competences as being critical - efficiency, internalisation, co-ordination and whole system design. All this research has been transformed into tools for use by members and other organisations, the usage of these tools and others is discussed in a later section.

After 4 years, we have 21 sustainable manufacturing tools that are complete or near completion and several others in earlier stages of development. We also have developed a series of 16 industry focused Quick Guides aimed at taking the ideas, concepts and tools generated by Centre researchers and presenting them in engaging 2 page documents that allow manufacturers to easily establish if and how an idea could work in their situation. In addition we have produced over 200 academic publications from our research. 

We aim to improve industrial practice but also to create future leaders and to inform policy. The Centre has an active and engaged Cohort (over 70 people from 21 research institutions attended the 2016 cohort week) who share ideas and collaborate through online meetings, specialised training sessions, dedicated newsletters, and an annual Cohort retreat. Our Cohort events are open to researchers from Universities and organisations beyond the 4 Centre partners and includes researchers from both UK and international universities. Currently 78 Centre researchers have recently completed PhDs and several of our 28 active PhD researchers are near completion. We have a very active visitor programme with faculty from around the UK and the world to improve industrial sustainability research competence.

The Centre is actively engaged in research to inform policy. Centre researchers had key roles to play in the UK Governments Foresight exercise setting out the 'Future of Manufacturing', including membership of the Lead expert Group and lead authors on contributing research reports. Sustainability, and many associated topics such as resilience, on-shoring and resource efficiency, are prominent in the report which is now informing the detail policy process. 

The Centre for Industrial Sustainability has been instrumental in working with politicians to set up and run the Manufacturing Commission in 2015. The commission is a cross party and cross sector Parliamentarian and industry-led body which drives new thinking around industrial policy in the UK. It conducts high-level research inquiries and makes recommendations to government and industry in order to instigate positive change in the UK manufacturing sector. Centre Director, Prof Steve Evans, Deputy Director, Prof Shahin Rahimifard and High Level Group Members Barry Sheerman MP and Prof Adisa Azapagic are all members of the Commission. The Manufacturing Commission launched an inquiry into Industrial Sustainability in February 2015. Co-chaired by Centre Director Prof Steve Evans, the inquiry sought to understand how UK manufacturing could help achieve long-term economic, environmental and social sustainability and to understand government's role in this. In the inquiry's final report 'Industrial Evolution, Making British Manufacturing Sustainable', published in October 2016, the inquiry made practical policy recommendations addressing key issues and themes currently affecting UK manufacturing and which threaten the UK's potential industrial growth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our research findings are being taken forward in several ways, mainly based on our standard research process which takes our new knowledge and transform that into tools that make the knowledge available to industry. Some tools will be hardware (e.g. shoe recycling equipment, some software (e.g. energy modelling for factories), and some are facilitation tools (e.g. value mapping to design new business models). All research follows this process and develops tools that are used, tested then released to a wider audience. Many of our sustainable business tools have been and are being actively used and making a difference in industry now as evidenced in our industry Case Studies. 

Our academic publications have been downloaded and cited by other publications numerous times. Our Quick Guides, Case Studies, conference presentations, annual reports, are all available for viewing and download from our website. Our international reports are being used by governments to develop their green growth strategies (Mongolia, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam).


Our next challenge is to embrace the evolving subject and the increasing attention it is receiving from industry and academia, and to increase the depth and speed of progress in helping the UK move to a sustainable industrial system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>76F3FCBF-3A33-4E40-8B33-8F7070100968</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.industrialsustainability.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of The Research Excellence Framework (REF) Sub-Panel - Steve Evans</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2052B01-82ED-46BE-8563-5760B1C80666</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ref.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UNIDO ASEAN Region Project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C95CC06-C9E3-420E-B423-F28A0FC26024</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Centre researchers worked with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) on a project to assess the economic, environmental and social dimenions of the industrial policies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), with the aim to encourage sustainable economic growth within the region.

Wider benefits from the programme, such as indirect jobs, environmental improvements, greater tax revenues and reduced spending on energy, transport and waste infrastructure, will also accrue to communities. 

Eight major barriers to improving non-resource productivity were found in the NMR study. Four of these barriers apply to most opportunities: senior executive leadership, information, skills and resources. The other four barriers relate to specific types of opportunities and also warrant attention: design, infrastructure, legal constraints and collaboration.

A programme to address these barriers has been developed in consultation with a range of multinational manufacturers, relevant government departments, NGOs and experts around the world.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nextmanufacturingrevolution.org/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All Parliamentary Inquiry and Report on Remanufacturing</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E57B16D-9D06-42E4-9B60-4D4A5C8EEACD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre is part of the All-Party Parliamentary Manufacturing Group (APMG) which encourages the exchange of knowledge and understanding between Parliament and the UK's diverse manufacturing industries, helping to raise the profile of manufacturing both inside and outside of Parliament.

There is an ongoing collaboration with Plan C to use the archetypes and BMIX as part of workshops and source more innovative cases to inspire businesses.
The sustainable business model archetypes are:
1. Optimise material and energy efficiency
2. Closing resource loops

This helps overcome the first barriers to implementation and gain momentum for more advanced activities. The toolkit helps identify improvements, strengths and weaknesses through examples of good practices and sustainable manufacturing models, assess current practice maturity (qualitative) and develop performance indicators (quantitative). The FREE toolkit also provides a strong framework on which companies can develop their own approach to eco-efficiency: as companies understand how eco-efficiency fits into their operations, they can customise their use of the FREE toolkit to match their specific needs. It can be used internally or across supply chains.

The tools are mapped against five key elements for eco-efficiency:
1) See waste. What is your waste worth? Learn to identify waste in your factory.
2) Find solutions. How can you remedy it? Finding quick wins to more advanced tactics for resource efficiency.
3) Set targets. What's the size of the prize? Determine potential benefits and set targets.
4) Assess yourself. Where are you now? Establish current performance and benchmarking.
5) Create good habits. Where to from here? Identify improvements in a systematic way, and make it a routine activity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FA918AD-E291-4697-B512-2D4FEC6AEC9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date the FEEM framework has been successfully trialled with 7 companies from different industry sectors.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Factory Eco-efficiency Modelling (FEEM) Framework</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Sustainable Value Analysis Tool (SVAT) is designed to help manufacturing companies identify opportunities to create sustainable value by analysing the captured and uncaptured value throughout the entire life cycle of products. Uncaptured value exists in almost all companies. Some uncaptured value is visible, e.g. waste streams in production, co-products, under-utilised resources, and reusable components of broken products; some is invisible, e.g. over capacity of labour, insufficient use of expertise and knowledge. Reducing any kind of the uncaptured value would create sustainable value. However, identifying the uncaptured value and creating value from it is not always easy. The tool supports this process, providing companies with a scheme to systematically look for each form of value uncaptured (i.e. value surplus, value absence, value destroyed and value missed) at the beginning, middle and end of the product life cycle, and with a method to turn the identified value uncaptured into value opportunities. The SVAT has been well received in 25 manufacturing companies across various sectors and of various sizes. It helped them find opportunities to create value internally and to discover the potential of creating mutual value externally. The tool has also been used for other purposes such as research, consultancy, business education and university education.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF41D28F-BAA1-4E24-A3D2-CFB726F692B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During its development, the SVAT has been used and well received in 15 manufacturing companies across various sectors and of various sizes.

The website includes benefits, guidelines, examples and key challenges. It includes a 5-minute opportunity assessment tool and the materials to run your own workshop. The website has been accessed by people in over 75 countries. The toolkit was developed on the ISMM course at IfM, University of Cambridge in 2013 by Jamie Evans and supervised by Dr Nancy Bocken. The toolkit will continue to run and develop going forward. At present a collaborative project has started with WRAP to develop the toolkit further, and expand its content and usage.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7B6515FE-8A47-4E36-A78F-FEA07376C572</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The website has been accessed by people in over 75 countries.

SOI does this by identifying responses to tensions that arise in such engagements. This tool provides a systematic approach for appraising opportunities in searching for sustainability-oriented innovations. It adopts a behavioural and institutional perspective in which unusual partners can engage and collaboratively source information to learn about what types of partnerships and incorporated logics support a better search for sustainable opportunities. The tool, therefore, stimulates thinking about sustainability oriented search processes and the suitability of different hybrid organizational forms used to create a larger variety of sustainability-oriented products and processes. The tool does this by appraising tensions and their resultant variety-generating responses that - owing to different search principles - change the course of search or result in the discovery useful information and knowledge. Academics and practitioners can use this tool to understand how to effectively increase variety in organizations searching for sustainable opportunities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3334A9FB-AA23-4F43-9E93-289D9302BFCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is anticipated this tool will be tested in industry during 2016 and impacts will be reported then.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sustainability-oriented innovation: The search for variety in hybrid organizational forms</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Is your business getting the full benefit of the value you are creating for customers and other stakeholders? Could your current business model be actively destroying value for others, ultimately affecting the organisation's ability to capture value in the long run? Answers to these questions and more are explored using three powerful innovation tools which make up the Sustainable Business Models Suite: Cambridge Value Mapping Tool, Sustainable Value Analysis Tool, and Business Transformation Tool. Together these tools enable new perspectives on value forms - missed, destroyed, surplus and absence and provide a structured approach to discover failed value exchanges among stakeholders and an organised method for implementing sustainable change in a business. The Sustainable Business Model Suite is used through workshops to help practitioners who want to gain a more complete understanding of the economic, social, and environmental value created by a business, and to explore opportunities for transforming the current business model towards a more sustainable one. The tools can be adapted to the size and complexity of the business from new start-ups to established multinationals.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2CA7547C-267F-40B1-BE9D-79D32AD12255</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sustainable Business Models Suite has been used extensively in workshops and in companies.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sustainable Business Models Suite: Transforming businesses to deliver uncaptured and sustainable value</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A framework has been developed to help companies embed sustainability considerations within their established product development processes. This is achieved through a systematic investigative method that can be used to assess existing design practices and identify both the critical features of the business and products that need to be improved, as well as any available opportunities already used within the design processes that can be employed to readily, and efficiently include consideration of sustainability.

By using this framework a company can therefore identify targeted and customised opportunities for improvement of sustainable design, expand understanding of their processes and products, and evolve towards a situation in the future where sustainability considerations are an embedded part of their design process - towards 'Ubiquitous Sustainability' in design.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7093BD1E-7D1A-4C88-BA7B-EB5276D951F5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact section to be completed.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Designing Ubiquitous Sustainability into Product Design Processes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Principle-Pattern-Practice is a design language for discussing a specific industrial system of a business with its partners, and for collectively envisioning future sustainable industrial systems. The purpose of this tool is to create a shared understanding among the diverse participants and decision makers involved in designing a sustainable industrial system. An industrial system can be collectively described and coherently understood in terms of its pattern, its set of principles, and the associated practice decisions. This tool helps identify the underlying principles of an industrial system based on manufacturing decisions. Through this tool, practitioners can discuss the manufacturing decisions (practice) and underlying principles of their current industrial system. They can then use this terminology to ideate about future sustainable industrial systems. The tool's ability to describe sustainable industrial systems is demonstrated for Industrial Symbiosis as an example in the accompanying figure.</gtr:description><gtr:id>424789B8-ABF5-461D-BE85-F54FAF5E0A65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is anticipated this tool will be tested in industry during 2016 and impacts will be reported then.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Principles - Pattern - Practice</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Industrial sustainability competency toolkit supports businesses and individuals in exploring possible future industrial systems and identifying priorities and actions that can be taken to move towards sustainable industrial systems. The toolkit can be used by organisations to diagnose current performance, identify potential areas of action which can deliver substantial performance improvements, and develop a collaborative plan for long-term competency development.
 
The dimensions of performance proposed are:
1) Efficiency - how well are current operations operated? (Focus on energy, water, materials input and waste and water output)
2) Internalisation - what is the approach to business model innovation? (seek value from its waste)
3) Coordination and collaboration - how effective is the business at identifying and working with unusually valuable partners?
4) Whole system design - how effective is the firm in conceptualising and implementing radically improved new system designs?
Competency assessment helps companies understand what they need to be good at in order to support the transition to a sustainable industrial system. Existing competency in efficiency, internalisation, collaboration &amp;amp; coordination, and whole system design are explored and compared with the performance of other organisations. Areas for improvement can then be identified and prioritised.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EBF7A97F-9449-4694-AA0C-032F4FC3C32C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The is tool has been used in workshops in the UK and internationally with industry and academia including a workshops with a global apparel company .

The assessment of material efficiency is based on the objectives of using less material processing to produce a unit product, to improve production yield, and to reduce the environmental impact of material processing. The framework uses a combined quantitative and qualitative approach to give structure to the investigation of complex systems, with the aim of uncovering innovative opportunities for improvement. The framework consists of five distinct phases: 1) production system scope, 2) material flow inventory, 3) material flow assessment, 4) improvement scenario modeling, and 5) interpretation. These phases are largely interdependent, with phases 1-4 following a largely sequential but potentially iterative progression. The fifth phase meanwhile runs in parallel with the other phases as an iterative and reflective mechanism, interpreting the results and applying suitable decision-making process.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7A449BD3-A419-4958-B09D-264611DBC585</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MFAM has been used to improve material flow and resource efficiency at a Unilver factory.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Material Flow Assessment in Manufacturing (MFAM) Framework</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge method for value generation</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D24B069-671F-46EA-A29C-177E3A7CE260</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tools comprising the method have been used in over 200 organisations</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Cambridge method for value generation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cambridgevaluegeneration.com</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A multitude of collections of principles have sprung up around the ideas of 'closing loops' and 'waste = food' over the last 15 years, such as Circular Economy (EMF, 2012), Blue Economy (Pauli, 2010) and Cradle to Cradle (McDonough and Braungart, 2002). However, these collections put forward different interpretations of 'circularity' and have distinct underlying assumptions and departure points, making it difficult to determine what 'going circular' means for your business. The Centre's Circularity Toolkit can help with this: tools unpack different forms of circularity, give an overview of the implications of various ways of organising it and finally zoom in on how to develop strategies for implementing circularity within your production processes, co- and by product generation and/ or on the level of components and products.

Developed in the 1970s by Motorola, technology roadmapping was developed when firms faced different challenges to the present resource constrained world. As such, this research has focused on identifying how the tool can be updated to help firms recognise and manage the impact of future resource constraints on their business. The revised tool guides participants through a series of simple activities to help them recognise how the availability of vital resources will impact their current product lines. The simple visual structure of the roadmap encourages participants to recognise how future resource shortages will place particular product lines at risk, encouraging them to reconsider their strategic vision. This could involve investing in alternative or low-resource technologies. In essence, the tool helps manufacturing firms devise more sustainable business strategy for a resource-constrained world.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D336BC7C-32F9-4CFD-A10A-CD7F82280EA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool has been used in workshops with industry over the past year and has helped businesses incorporate considerations of potential resource shortages while development of future business strategies.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Resource Aware Roadmapping</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This research is studying Sustainable Business Models for the process industry.
