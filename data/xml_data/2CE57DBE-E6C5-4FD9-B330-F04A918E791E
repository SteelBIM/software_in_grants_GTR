Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J019445/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Sue Waite and Rowena Passy, co-leaders of the outdoor and experiential learning research network at Plymouth University have received funding from the ESRC to develop an international network with partners from Australia, Denmark and Singapore. The aim is to develop the field of research, policy and practice in learning outside the classroom for students of school age (ie up to 18) through cross-national collaboration. The award lasts for three years, starting in December 2012.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Partners will draw together international evidence relating to learning outside the classroom and use this as a springboard for developing cutting-edge cross-national and comparative research to build better understandings of the relationships between place, curriculum, pedagogy, learning and schooling.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A series of workshops and conferences will be held in the partner countries to support research, share findings, theorise and create dialogue; reciprocal guest lectures will be held in each institution at the time of these workshops, and a programme for research exchange will be set up for early-career researchers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will be supported by a dedicated website. Partners intend to publish collaborative papers and develop a common research agenda that can be explored in different national educational contexts. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>School-aged pupils will benefit from the activities of this international network which will help to clarify theory and rationales for learning outside the classroom. This form of learning is widely accepted for early years children but pupils in England currently experience marked decline in the opportunities for learning outdoors after the Foundation Stage (Waite, 2010). Other countries report a similar reduction, which is often attributed to the increasing pressure for achievement of performance standards. Research, however, suggests that young people enjoy learning outside the classroom, and that it can have cognitive, social, emotional and behavioural benefits for participants of all ages (Dillon et al. 2005; Rickinson et al., 2004). Learning outside the classroom also appears to engage young people with their learning because they see a purpose for learning beyond academic attainment performance (Passy et al., 2010; Waite &amp;amp; Passy, 2011; Waite, 2011).Through our programme of international, collaborative research that will engage with evidence, pedagogy and theory of learning outside the classroom, we aim to influence teachers' and other practitioners' decisions about learning outside the classroom to the benefit of their pupils.

Teachers in the various countries represented in the partnership and wider network experience different degrees of external pressure through high stakes testing and different curricular and pedagogic traditions. Developing greater clarity about the relationship between these and outcomes associated with learning outside the classroom will help teachers to make decisions about appropriate proportions and forms of outdoor learning.

Learning outside the classroom practitioners are increasingly being employed in some nations to provide outdoor activities to supplement the schooling offered by mainstream practitioners. Market-based outdoor learning introduces further complication to its provision as benefits may compete with profit and the degree of match between activities and their potential benefits needs critical examination. The work of the network will assist learning outside the classroom practitioners, teachers and policy makers to understand how best commercial outdoor learning provision can articulate with mainstream educational practice. 

Teacher trainers have the responsibility to equip student teachers with the capacity to provide broad and balanced curricula for their future pupils. The debate and critical commentary arising from our network partnership will help to inform HEIs involved in teacher training to prepare their students to critically appraise learning outside the classroom and better match purposes with provision. 

Policy-makers' use of international comparative data has sometimes been criticised for its failure to take sufficient account of the cultural factors that situate it (Alexander et al., 1999). However, some comparative work has focused at a micro level on what happens within classrooms within wider contextual understanding (Tobin, 1999). This international partnership will support us in avoiding generalisations without due attention to cultural, curricular and pedagogic distinctions and hence provide more grounded and theorised recommendations for policy and practice. 

The role of local communities in learning outside the classroom is currently under-researched and under-theorised (Seaman &amp;amp; Rheingold, 2010). The work undertaken by the partnership will facilitate greater understanding of how communities can be involved in these activities and the impact this involvement may have on social cohesion. 

Invitations will be extended to teachers, student teachers, teacher trainers, learning outside the classroom practitioners and policy makers to network events and policy briefings. Summaries of papers and activities will be posted on the website in addition to developing a coherent body of academic and practitioner publications.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Linkoping University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Sweden, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Go Outside and Learn ERASMUS+ bid</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D9E3FCE-F719-44A4-997D-056152D002A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PEOTI bid

Elements of the Student Outcomes and Natural Schooling report from the conference have been included in the Outdoor Education Advisors' Panel guidelines for schools. This report from the Lessons from Near and Far conference which highlighted partners' national responses to improving the policy/research interface has informed a response by the Council for Learning Outside the Classroom to the Education select committee's 'The Purpose of Education' consultation. It has also contributed more generally to the Natural England Strategic Research groups for Learning in Natural Environments and Outdoors for All through Waite's membership on these groups. Bentsen and Mygind have been pivotal in major policy and practice developments regarding outdoor learning in Denmark, including a seminar series about udeskole (four seminars a year aimed at teachers), created a homepage at the Ministry of Education's learning portal about udeskole (aimed at teachers), had a demonstration project (for the development of udeskole) with schools, created a row of short articles /extension papers aimed at teachers and schools, in the process of publishing a text book about udeskole, subjects and pedagogy (will be published 2017) aimed at teachers and teacher educators, in the process of creating an E-learning course aimed at teachers, held two national conferences, disseminated through twitter accounts, LinkedIn and institutional homepages, had several meetings with the ministry of education and the ministry of environment and presented on Danish national radio (documentary / feature programme) and are actively influencing practice in other countries, such as Spain.
Colleagues in Singapore have secured entitlement to outdoor education throughout schooling as part of the Ministry of Education policy and practice in schools. A Singapore delegation visited Denmark to learn from their project TEACHOUT.
Stewart and Gough's work has been recognised as seminal in place-sensitive environmental education and is informing the development of practice internationally. Waite has been invited to present a keynote at Outdoor Victoria's Education Conference and a 1 day research symposium prior to the 2 day State Conference. She has also been invited to support development of outdoor learning policy and practice through a one week residency in May 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5145269B-256F-4208-9355-C6C969ADE97C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This international partnership network award allowed us to meet colleagues from three other countries, Australia, Denmark and Singapore, to enhance our mutual understanding of outdoor learning. Learning outside the classroom in natural environments has a number of evidenced benefits for children and society. Children from poorer backgrounds have less access to nature, yet:
? students perform better in reading, mathematics, science and, social studies and show greater motivation for studying science when they have opportunities to learn outside the classroom
? personal, practical and social skill development is associated with learning outside
? school subjects are enriched and students more motivated to learn by outdoor experiences 
? natural environments promote physical and mental health 
? exposure to nature leads to greater awareness and care for the environment. 
 
Universal access to these benefits for children is therefore an important societal aim.
In some cultures (such as Denmark), time spent outside in childhood is relatively frequent through families, but schools across the four project nations generally represent a common context in which access to nature for children and building new cultural attitudes towards nature in order to gain these benefits could be addressed in an equitable way. In all four countries in our partnership, we looked at the policies and practice of outdoor learning to identify the opportunities and challenges to support increased levels of outdoor learning. In Denmark and England, we were leading similar large scale projects (TEACHOUT, with an associated continuing professional development programme http://teachout.ku.dk/om-projektet/beskrivelse/description.pdf and Natural Connections https://naturalconnectionsblog.wordpress.com/ ) that were researching and delivering programmes to increase the numbers of children benefiting from outdoor learning. In Singapore, the Ministry of Education was already supporting expansion of opportunities to learn outdoors in line with their recognition that academic achievement was not the only aim for education. Partners here developed a project to explore the motivations that led people to provide those opportunities; the majority of which were through community organisations. The Australian partners particularly supported our thinking about ways of teaching and learning environmentally sound outdoor learning.
Our conclusions are that we need to be careful about apolitical and decontextualized claims for outdoor learning whereby all forms are seen as a panacea for all societal problems. Purpose, place, people, and pedagogy must be foregrounded in research and practice of outdoor learning to develop more nuanced use of diverse forms in order to achieve specific outcomes for children and young people in the most cost effective ways. Thinking about what we want to achieve by taking learning outside the classroom helps us to choose places and pedagogy more wisely. We have developed a framework for comparing different forms of outdoor learning both within and across cultures, and the Lessons from Near and Far conference in July 2015 included a wide range of international cultural perspectives and opened a wider conversation about pathways to the benefits of outdoor learning through different theory and practices. These tools will impact upon ways in which outdoor learning is understood internationally and inform our countries' policy and practice development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We continue to work with practitioners and policy makers through the outdoor and experiential learning research network (over 200 members) in England, and through our respective national and international networks.
