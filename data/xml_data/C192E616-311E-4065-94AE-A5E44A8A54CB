Two major signal transduction pathways, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), coordinate the activity of S6Ks in response to extracellular and intracellular stimuli, such as growth factors, mitogens, metabolites and nutrients. In an activate state, S6Ks translocate to discrete cellular compartments/multienzyme complexes, where they interact with and phosphorylate diverse substrates implicated in the regulation of translation, RNA processing, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell growth and survival. A growing body of evidence links S6K signalling to various human pathologies, including diabetes, ageing and cancer. 
In mammalian cells, there are two isoforms of S6K, termed S6K1 and S6K2. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling has been reported for both isoforms of S6Ks, but their nuclear functions are not well understood. This grant application is based on our novel findings which imply the role of S6K2 in the regulation of transcription. We provide the evidence that S6K2 possesses an AT-hook DNA-binding domain at the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain, which mediates specific interaction with DNA. We also found that the activity of S6K2 is induced by direct interaction with DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, mutational studies of the AT-hook motif revealed its importance in the regulation of S6K2 pro-survival signalling. 
To further advance these original findings, we propose to study molecular mechanisms of S6K2-DNA interaction and an alternative model of S6K2 activation upon DNA binding by employing a range of biophysical, biochemical and cellular approaches. Our efforts will be also focused on exploring a cooperative mode of interaction between S6K2 and transcription factors in targeting promoter and enhancer regions of a specific set of genes, implicated in the regulation of S6K2-mediated cellular processes. Mammalian cell models and xenograft studies in nude mice will be employed to study the role of the S6K2 AT-hook motif in the regulation of transcription, ribosome biogenesis, cell survival and growth. It is expected that the proposed study will give deeper insight into nuclear functions of S6K2 and its implication in the regulation of transcription. Unique features of the S6K2-DNA interaction are not only of academic interest, but may also provide novel insights applicable to drug development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) is implicated in the regulation of cell growth, survival and glucose metabolism in response to extracellular stimuli and stresses. Deregulation of S6K signaling has been linked to various human pathologies, including obesity, diabetes and cancer. To date, nuclear functions of S6Ks are not well understood. We have recently discovered a novel feature of S6K2 regulation involving specific interaction with DNA via the AT-hook motif and the activation of its kinase activity. These original findings are fur-ther supported by mutational studies which reveal the importance of the AT-hook motif in S6K2 pro-survival signalling. We hypothesize that S6K2 has a potential to form regulatory complexes with transcription factors which may deliver the kinase at promoter regions of target genes in a sequence-specific manner. At DNA, the AT-hook motif can interact with the minor groove of AT-rich sequences, leading to a conformational change and activation of S6K2. In an activated state, S6K2 may modulate gene expression through phosphoryla-tion of transcription factors and/or protein-protein interactions. In the proposed study, we will focus to: a) investigate the molecular basis of the S6K2/DNA interaction; b) test an al-ternative model of S6K2 activation by DNA binding; c) explore a cooperation between S6K2 and transcription factors in targeting prompter/enhancer regions of a specific set of genes; d) investigate physiological relevance of the DNA binding activity of S6K2, focusing in particular on the regulation of transcription, ribosome biogenesis, cell growth and sur-vival. The proposed study may uncover a second member of a protein kinase family, in addition to DNA-PK, with a potential to be activated upon direct bindsing to DNA. It might also establish a platform for the development of small molecule compounds capable to block S6K2/DNA interaction and relevant S6K2-mediated functions.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary benefit of the proposed research relates to increased knowledge of the regulation and function of S6K2, which we will intend to disseminate through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conferences, and free-to-access websites. We will also make S6K reagents and technical expertise freely available and will attempt to stimulate research in this field. Considering the current gap in knowledge relating to S6K2 regulation and function and our novel findings that the activity of S6K2 can be regulated by DNA binding, we believe the proposed research has the potential to significantly contribute to a better understanding of the roles of S6K2 in health and disease, and in the long-term, development of better treatment for diseases in which S6K2 is implicated. In particular, the study of the mechanism of S6K2 activation by DNA binding may present an opportunity for developing a novel way to modulate the activity of S6K2 and its downstream effects. We have an on-going S6K drug discovery programme which is primarily focused on developing small molecule inhibitors for S6K1. Where possible, we will feed findings from the proposed study into our ongoing drug discovery project and stimulate the development of a HTP screen for the identification of small molecule compounds capable to specifically inhibit the S6K2/DNA interaction. The proposed work therefore has the potential to initiate the development of novel therapeutic drugs in the long-term, as well as fostering positive economic outcomes, considering the rapidly growing global pharmaceutical market for protein kinase inhibitors. Another potential benefit of this research relates to the experience and skills gained by the staff involved in this project, which includes undergraduate and internship students who will work on the project. The proposed research offers a diverse range of techniques including biochemical and molecular biology techniques, bacterial and baculoviral expression of recombinant proteins, lentiviral overexpression and downregulation, mammalian cell biology, in vitro kinase assays and SPR analysis. Effective time-management, co-ordination and communication skills will therefore be critical for successful completion of this highly multidisciplinary project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>474299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Evotec</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Enhancing structural information to aid design of novel irreversible inhibitors of S6K2 for the treatment of lung cancer</gtr:description><gtr:id>F603D312-CE36-4D1F-A359-307195AE9D80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In progress</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Evotec was involved in the design of expression constructs and the advice was also provided at various stages of their purification and quality control.

NIH3T3 and A549 cell lines with stable expression of wtS6K1 and wtS6K2 was established.
2. The rate of proliferation of generated cell lines was analysed under various experimental conditions. We found that wtS6K2, but not wtS6K1, induces the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells under serum-starved condition (1% FCS). 
3. Xenografts studies in nude mice revealed that overexpression of wtS6K2 in A549 cells, but not wtS6K1 in A549 cells, promotes the growth of tumors.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A substantial amount of research has been carried out in Prof. Meng's laboratory on the collaborative project. The research was mainly conducted by Dr. X. Wang (XW), who has recently completed a PhD study on elucidating the function of the mTOR pathway in LM laboratory. XW was successful in establishing NIH3T3 and A549 cell lines with stable expression of wtS6K1 and wtS6K2 proteins from provided constructs. Moreover, XW compared the rate of proliferation of generated cell lines under various experimental conditions. These studies revealed that wtS6K2, but not wtS6K1, induces the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells under serum-starved condition (1% FCS). Interestingly, this effect was not observed when cells were cultured with 10% FCS. This is a very interesting observation and we plan to explore it further. In addition, LM team compared the growth of tumors from xenografts of A549 cells, overexpressing wtS6K1, wtS6K2 and vector alone. We have recently received the first set of experimental results, which indicate that overexpression of wtS6K2, but not wtS6K1 in A549 cells, promotes the growth of tumors. Moreover, testing the growth of A549 cells overexpressing mutant forms of S6K2 in xenograft studies is currently in progress.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The interaction between both teams was initiated in March 2013, when I attended the 5th National Forum on New Technologies in Drug Discovery, which took place in Shanghai (11-13 March 2013). After my presentation, I was approached by Prof. L. Meng, who has a long-term interest in targeting the PI3K/mTOR pathway for drug discovery and identifying novel biomarkers. On LM's invitation, I visited the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica after the meeting and had the opportunity to see centralized research facilities and to learn more about the research on the PI3K/mTOR pathway in the Division of Antitumor Pharmacology. I had a stimulating discussion with the Institute's Director Prof. D. Jing, who heads a State Key Laboratory of Drug Research affiliated to SIMM which focuses on developing novel anti-cancer drugs by targeting topoisomerases, microtubules, tyrosine kinases, heparanases and the PI3K/mTOR pathway. Discussions with LM and DJ allowed to identify the prospects for collaborative interactions on two closely linked projects: a) investigation of molecular mechanisms of S6K activation under physiological conditions and their deregulation in cancer and other human pathologies; and b) further development of novel S6K inhibitors identified in the frame of the ongoing drug discovery program at UCL. 
In the middle of 2013, the Material transfer and collaboration agreement on the S6K project was signed between UCL and SIMM. Soon after, a panel of plasmids directing the expression of wtS6K1, wtS6K2, S6K2-S2 splicing isoform and several mutant forms of S6K2 was then shipped to Prof. Meng's laboratory. During my second visit to SIMM in the beginning of 2014, the progress on the initiated collaborative project was discussed in details and the prospects for preparing joint publications and grant applications.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Johnson &amp; Johnson</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Targeting S6K2 for anti-cancer drug discovery</gtr:description><gtr:id>561BB450-6F93-4E7F-A982-25D84C49D3B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a multidisciplinary collaborative project, involving researchers with the expertize in:
a) bioinformatics (developing 3D homology models, molecular docking studies etc)
b) medicinal chemistry 
c) biochemical studies and cell-based assays</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In the frame of this project, we collaborated with the UCL Drug Discovery Group. 
The 3D structure of S6K2 kinase domain has not been solved so far. Therefore, a 3D homology model of the S6K2 kinase domain was built on the crystal structures of the S6K1 kinase domain;
The model revealed a distinctive cysteine (Cys150) in the hinge region of the ATP-binding pocket of S6K2, but not S6K1. There are only four other kinases in the Kinome (over 500 protein kinases) with Cys at this position (FGFR4, TTK, MAPKAPK2 &amp;amp; MAPKAPK3). 
Based on these findings, a panel of small molecule compounds were designed to target the S6K2 ATP binding pocket and Cys150 for irreversible inhibition. 
The expertize on the design of irreversible S6K2 inhibitors and the development of S6K screening platforms was provided by researchers from J&amp;amp;J.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The main focus of this collaborative project was to use an iterative process involving design, molecular docking/dynamics, synthesis and in vitro/in vivo testing to drive the development of irreversible S6K2 inhibitors. 
We expressed His-S6K1 and His-S6K2 using baculoviral expression system;
Several milligrams of recombinant S6K1 and S6K2 were purified and their activities tested;
Recombinant preparations of S6K1 and S6K2 were used to set up the Alphascreen and LANCE screen, specifically designed for testing S6K1/2 activities;

The publication of these novel findings can advance our understanding on: a) the role of S6K2 in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival in normal and cancer cells; b) the mechanism of S6K2 activation by DNA binding; c) the development of novel small molecule inhibitors/anti-cancer drugs targeting S6K2.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>53E60405-4996-46B4-AA5D-C55B35372EAB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member, International Expert Council, State Fund for Fundamental Research in Ukraine</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED01A5EE-732B-4F8C-B16F-B28E817A07E0</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have recently generated a conditional S6K2 kinase-dead knock-in mouse model which can help us to elucidate the function of S6 kinase under various experimental conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5BE6F616-5CB8-4D39-A255-443B9A92D6F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The S6K2 kinase-dead knock-in mouse model will be also used to test the efficacy of the S6K2 inhibitors developed in the frame of the in-house S6K drug discovery programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Generation of S6K2 kinase-dead knock-in mouse model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.ucl.ac.uk/biosciences/departments/smb/people/iris-profiles/gout-ivan</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a panel of highly specific S6K1 and S6K2 monoclonal antibodies which work efficiently in a diverse range of immunological assays, including Western blotting, immunoprecipitation and ELISA and immunohistochemistry.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4186CF15-7315-4F18-BB15-20BF9C6EF92D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaborative interactions have been established in the field of mTOR/S6K signalling with research teams from academia and industry.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Development of S6K1 and S6K2 specific monoclonal antibodies</gtr:title><gtr:type>Antibody</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have recently developed S6K2 kinase-dead conditional knock-in mouse model.
