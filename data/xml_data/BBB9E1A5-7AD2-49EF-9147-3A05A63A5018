ears</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/I009671/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Insects have marvelous ears. Some insects, like mosquitoes, use antennae in front of their heads to detect sounds, mainly those of approaching females. Notably, our research has shown the ear of a mosquito is as sensitive to vibrations as the human ear and contains just as many vibration sensitive cells -16,000. Other insect, like crickets, locust and some rare flies use ears equipped with an eardrum, or tympanal membrane. The human ear also has an eardrum that serves to convert sound into motion. This motion is in turn transduced into the electrical signal that vibration sensitive cells then convey to the brain. Because sound-induced vibrations are very small, this process is extremely delicate. In insects, a similar process takes place, but with an ear that is sometimes 100 times smaller. Our research and that of others has shown that the eardrums of insects are sophisticated instruments that evolved for hundreds of millions of years to extract the faint sound energy and deliver it to the vibration sensitive cells. In particular we showed that in locusts the tympanum has at least one additional function: sorting the tone frequencies relevant to the life and survival of the animal. This is a form of mechanical information processing that takes place even before neuronal processing. Normal membrane vibrations are in the range of nanometers and take the shape of a traveling wave across the membrane surface area. We discovered that this wave is exquisitely timed, lasting 100 millionth of a second, strongly resembling a tsunami coming up to a shore. Interestingly, the propagation of this biological nanotsunami depends on the frequency of the sound that creates it, not its direction. The build up of the wave in effect provides the animal with the perception of tones. The work proposed aims at discovering the exact material properties and membrane architecture that allow for that wave to build up and generate directional frequency decomposition. We will use laser beams to monitor the vibrations, using the Doppler effect applied to light, to detect membrane motion with a resolution of the diameter of an atom of hydrogen. For the first time we will use focused ion beam milling to modify the geometry, tension and mass characteristics of the membranes and then explore the resulting vibrational behaviour. Ion beam milling uses an atomically thin jet of metal ions projected onto the object and can be used to either cut through objects, hard or soft, or add matter to that object. This technique has never been used to study micro and nanomechanics. Importantly, mathematical modeling will guide the search for mechanisms, by predicting the best way to alter the membrane to generate desired effects and thereby also delineating the key physical parameters, materials and architecture, that are sufficient and necessary for membrane function. Because we use three species of tympanate insects, we will be able to compare and contrast the results and adequacy of the approach. Why the membrane of the locust is vibrating one way, and that of the cricket another way, with different information coding properties, is still elusive. Using focused ion beams we will attempt to add or remove functions from the respective species, and understand what evolution by natural selection has achieved in the developing the tiny ears of insects. From the proposed research, we will also learn how to make better microphones, using in technology what we have observed in biology. This is especially useful when the goal is manufacture robust microphones a millimeter in size and less. Examples of application pertain to hearing aid microphones capable of on-board frequency and directional processing as well as subminiature microphone for electronic application with minimal power consumption.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed work seeks a 1. Test the mechanical response and properties of the tympanal membranes of several Orthoptera insect species. 2. Produce for analytical purposes modifications of these membranes using innovative FIB technology, either by controlled accretion or deletion of material. 3. Generate predictive and structurally explicit models that will allow for the material and structural design of artificial smart sensor membranes. To achieve our objectives, the vibrational mechanics of insect tympana will be studied using a microscanning laser Doppler vibrometer (mLDV). Tympana will be examined by mLDV employing a destructive (removal of elements) and constructive (addition of elements) approach using focused ion beam (FIB) techniques. Physical models of the tympana will be constructed and tested in order to study the contribution of individual elements to the behaviour of the entire membrane. In addition, computer simulations of these membranes will be used to model and hence dissect the physics underlying membrane behaviour, leading the way to rational miniature acoustic sensor design. The interplay between modeling and experimentation will embody the systems biology approach of our research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research planned will have impact on scientific research beyond the field of hearing in insects. Whilst enhancing our knowledge of insect systems, the results are expected, as it has been the case for our past research, to have implications for our fundamental and mechanistic understanding of auditory function in general. The function that the structure of tympanal membranes plays in vibration conduction is still very much unknown, even for humans. Novel data indicates that information processing already takes place at that level, and that efficient acousto-mechanical transduction relies on subtle mechanical properties of tympanal membranes. Because the ears of animals surpass all technological devices known today in sensitivity, adaptability and robustness, it is important we learn more about how they work, how to make them, how to predict their behavior when they change/age, and how to repair them. Outside our own community of sensory research, two main sectors can be now identified as potential beneficiaries; sensor technology (ST) and ear nose and throat surgery (ENT). Sensor research has already benefited from our work (subminiature directional microphones; NIH, Sandia labs). The work proposed will have impact on how the membranes of microphones can be designed as to be smaller, more robust, more sensitive, and carry out some of the signal processing. A microphone 10 times smaller, less energy demanding and more sensitive is the target of such endeavour, massively improving the quality of acoustic and pressure micro-sensors with signal processing capabilities. Attractively, because the work proposed in this project includes the prototyping of plastic-based sensors, manufacturing could rely on cheap raw materials and existing production and packaging technology. Foreseeable beneficiaries in the in the high-tech manufacturing sector will be microphone and pressure sensors manufacturers, and hearing aid companies. The mechanisms planned to engage with this community are multiple, through articles in the relevant journals, and more efficiently by inviting visits and workshops to present the work done. This would only be done once advancement is sufficient. As done in the past, collaborations can be suggested, in the best form of a case-award. Medically, the replacement of the eardrum, or tympanoplasty is a usually restorative intervention that offers some durability. Our research on the importance of the fine structure of eardrums on their sound collecting capacity indicates that there is some knowledge to contribute to tympanal grafts. Although not in the plan, it our intention to explore with our colleagues in ENT (with whom we measure middle ear implants in situ, Dr. Nunez and Mr. Holland, and related biomedical engineering fims), what type of improvement a microstructured graft (natural tissue or plastic) could bring to auditory function. More such research can be anticipated to lead to the improvement of health in the UK, and pioneer novel medical technology. The PI's previous work has led to the development and patenting of directional silicon-based microphones. This development has proved useful in human health applications (in ear hearing aids, blind location devices). It also prompted developments in surveillance technology (sound triggered superdirectional cameras). However, the PI's experience of these cases shows that the development time can be very long (10 years). Another aspect of importance is the continuation of collaborations that we have been developing with the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, India. This collaboration was enabled by the award of UK-India Education and Research Initiative grant (British Council). The recent award of a Marie Curie Research Fellowship to Dr. Natasha Mhatre is a direct result from the UKIERI activity. The impact here will be to continue developing the links to India, with insider knowledge, and recruit students and research fellows.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>471449</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>R.

Sir Paul Nurse, PRS, took that very example of reconstruction of a 165 million year old cricket song as an example of discovery science in his 2012 Dimbleby lecture.

Many requests were made after the exhibit for more material, mostly publications, photos, audio recordings, for teachers to use in their lessons in biology and physics.

As it was the case in other science exhibits, the visitors were fascinated by the science presented, and their questions and enthusiasm about biology was very apparent. As the life sciences are, in the words of Sir David Attenborough, the most important activity in Science for this century, it is good to see that both the public, research institutions, Universities and other bodies pay attention to the urgency of knowing more about the world that supports us. Much more work is however needed to implement the changes we want to see.

Very little indirect feedback has been received to date after the final exhibit in London. For previous presentations, it is so that head teachers from schools do not come back to us personally to tell us that their intake in science GCSEs are up. It is not expected either. The feedback we get as public engagement scientists, researchers and teachers is instantaneous, the facial expressions, the questioning, the returning to the stand with accompanied with friends and teachers, and the expression of marvel at what they just saw and learned about. If we manage to make some of our hong visitors want to become scientists or engage in environmental science, working groups, or colleges, we have done something good.
of course, we also look towards the improvement of health and wealth in the UK, responding to the broader and longer-term goals of the engagement of science to the development of a better human society. Here also, more work is needed to do it, and generate tangible impacts at the many societal levels envisaged.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/society/exhibitions/gb-bioscience-festival/gb-bioscience-festival-index.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hive Alive BBC2</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E4B067A-DF67-4789-9846-D85716B73505</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lively show on bee biology and the need for attention scientific and political on bee health.

Yet, the instant feedback we experience from the audience, from the visitors, ells us about their amazement at the beauty and complexity of the biological world. When bees are concerned, which is one of the themes of research we pursue and present in public engagement, the awareness of the visitors is very much alive; our contribution is to enrich the context of their knowledge on bee biology, life history and uncertainty for the future. Outcomes encompass invitation to speak at the Bristol Scientific Cafe at the Tobacco Factory Cultural Center, the Bristol Science Club, the British Beekeeper's association, and give interviews to the press and television.

Impacts of this activity are sometimes measured by the pupillary and eyelid expansion, and level of yaw dropping in pupils. Many pupils from schools in and around Bristol have convinced us that they are fascinated by biology. Because we present science at the interface between Physics and biology, we reach areas of connections that are not necessarily made in the classroom. We have witnessed the realisation in many pupils that one can do cool physics by studying biology, and the reverse as well. Quite satisfactorily, their teachings think the same and ask for material to incorporate into their lectures.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bnhc.org.uk/festival-of-nature/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2010,2011,2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bristol Bright Night - European wide Science Night</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B1245220-CB82-412E-BBB9-CEC4184940A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results were tangible amazement of visitors, interest from well informed public who come to the Bristol Science Museum. One result was also to increase awareness of the engagement of the University with local communities, through the Science Museum, and the presence of Bristol on the European stage of public engagement in science.

One specific outcome is the start of a project with the Bristol Science Museum, developing an interactive display on electrostatics and the way we can detect it, emulating the senses that bees use to interact with flowers. This is a very exciting project (well funded) that will attract a lot of attention and will be able to be exported in other UK museums, and overseas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bnhc.org.uk/festival-of-nature/european-researchers-night/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Filming for One Show</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54C8DACA-40AF-4EF6-86E4-2FF41DE18084</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The One Show has a huge audience, and it was important that the opportunity was taken, as the exposure promised is large. one result for us was to expand our experience at such media presentation, although not the first it was a great teaching in the presentation of scientific facts to the largest possible audience in the UK.

To this day this is the record number of visits for one news item. see url bellow.

Impacts are difficult to know in completeness, but the major ones are the large publicity platform it has created, the demonstration that curiosity driven research can be useful and impactful, and that public engagement is essential to the development of modern science.
