This first line of defence is called the innate immune system and my research is directed at understanding how it works.

Although the innate immune system is vital to combat infection, it is also a &amp;quot;double-edged&amp;quot; sword because, if switched on too strongly or for too long a period of time, or if it cannot be switched off effectively, it can cause autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These include rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, lupus, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, asthma and sepsis. Understanding the mechanisms that keep the innate immune system in check, and which switch it off after it has done its job, is therefore extremely important. 

My recent research has begun to identify several mechanisms for keeping the innate immune system in check that were not appreciated previously and one goal of my research programme is to understand how they operate in much greater detail. These studies are likely to identify components of the innate immune system that can be targeted to develop improved drugs for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. I am facilitating drug development through a unique collaboration that I set up in 1998 with six of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies, and which has recently been renewed until 2016. In this way, the companies are not only provided with the results of my research as soon as the discoveries have been made, but they also receive the chemicals, technologies and know-how that they need to rapidly start new drug discovery programmes and accelerate others.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to develop our understanding of novel mechanisms we have identified that keep the innate immune system in check and prevent autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Understanding how this system is controlled and its de-regulation in disease is a prerequisite for the development of new treatments for these conditions.

We will study a protein kinase subfamily that we have found to restrict the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. We will identify which members of this subfamily mediate this effect and the underlying molecular mechanism. We will develop specific inhibitors of these kinases via collaborations with academic colleagues as well as via a unique collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry, which we have renewed until 2016. 

We have discovered that the IKK-related kinases (IKKepsilon and TBK1) restrict pro-inflammatory cytokine production by inhibiting the activation of NFkappaB. We have also identified additional, putative substrates of these kinases, which suggest that they restrict innate immune signalling pathways in other ways. We will elucidate these mechanisms and establish their importance in keeping innate immunity in check.

We will develop our discovery that polyubiquitin-binding to ABIN1 and ABIN2 prevents lupus and protects against colitis, respectively. We will elucidate how ABIN2 protects against colitis and the molecular mechanism(s) by which ABIN1 and ABIN2 restrict innate immune signaling pathways. We will also investigate whether the deubiquitylase activity of A20, a protein that interacts with ABIN1 and ABIN2, is critical for the functions of the ABINs.

This multidisciplinary research programme will exploit state-of-the-art techniques in protein chemistry, enzymology, mass spectrometry, signal transduction, immunology, mouse genetics and molecular pharmacology and should lead to the elucidation of key mechanisms that restrict the activation of innate immune signaling pathways.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Abnormalities in protein phosphorylation cause cancer and other diseases and protein kinases have become the pharmaceutical industry's most important class of drug target. 16 kinase inhibitors have been approved for cancer since 2001, which include Gleevec that has transformed a fatal leukaemia to a manageable condition. The current market for kinase therapies is $15 billion p.a. with 200 more kinase inhibitors in clinical trials. The JAK inhibitors Tasocitinib and Ruxolitinib should be approved for treating rheumatoid arthritis in 2012, the first kinase inhibitors approved outside oncology. My research on innate immunity is therefore becoming of increasing interest to pharma. They and the companies that market the reagents I produce will be the non-academic beneficiaries of my research.

In 1998 I founded the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT), which has become the largest collaboration between academia and the pharmaceutical industry. It is widely regarded as a model for effective interaction between academia and industry, and received a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher Education in 2006. Agreement to renew funding for the DSTT for a further 4 years from July 2012 has just been agreed with AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson and Johnson, Merck-Serono and Pfizer, a clear indication of its value to Pharma. Through this collaboration the companies obtain rapid access to the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit's (MRC-PPU) unpublished results, reagents and technologies and the first right to licence the IP generated. 

Upstate Inc. was set up in Dundee in 1999 to build on a successful, commercial relationship with the MRC-PPU that began in 1995. Upstate Dundee exploited the kinase profiling technology I developed very successfully and employed 125 by 2004 when it was acquired by Serologicals for $205 milion. Subsequent acquisions by Millipore and then Merck KGaA created Merck-Millipore in 2010, who market 300 products developed by the MRC-PPU, many generated by my research team. This is an efficient way of distributing my reagents to thousands of laboratories worldwide while also generating significant revenue for the MRC-PPU. In 2005, these royalties were used to rehouse the MRC-PPU in the new Sir James Black Centre saving the MRC &amp;pound;4.5 million.

Like phosphorylation, ubiquitylation regulates almost all aspects of cell life and is becoming a major area of drug discovery (Cohen and Tcherpakov, 2010, Cell 143, 686-693). In 2008 I therefore founded the Scottish Institute for Cell Signaling (SCILLS) the world's first Unit dedicated to the study of ubiquitylation with funding of &amp;pound;10 million from the Scottish Government. The Unit has developed rapidly and now has 8 PIs and 55 scientific and support staff. For this reason, the field of the DSTT will change in July 2012 from &amp;quot;kinases and phosphatases&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;kinases and the ubiquitin system&amp;quot;. 

In 2009, I persuaded US-based Stemgent Inc. to found Ubiquigent Ltd in Dundee, which markets proteins, assays and services developed by SCILLS. 10% of the shares are owned by the MRC and 10% by the University of Dundee, which will be worth a substantial sum if Ubiquigent is listed on a stock exchange. In addition, Ubiquigent market components of the ubiquitin system produced by my research team. This contributes to its development and creates a royalty stream for SCILLS, which is already becoming significant.

I have recently identified the SIK subfamily as kinases that suppress the production of IL-10 and other anti-inflammatory molecules. The proposed research will lead to the development specific SIK inhibitors with potential for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. If successful, this will generate substantial revenue for the MRC-PPU and College of Life Sciences at Dundee, and eventually benefit patients with inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1456162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Johnson &amp; Johnson</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:department>Janssen Pharmaceutica</gtr:department><gtr:description>DSTT</gtr:description><gtr:id>2BBCF1E4-DDFF-48CA-8617-7A8101B90183</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the collaboration, the Unit has helped to launch and/or accelerate many drug discovery programmes, some of which have entered human clinical trials. The collaboration led the Unit to develop the technology of protein kinase profiling which has developed into an industry worth over &amp;pound;100 million per annum. It also led to the creation of the European Division of Upstate Incorporated in Dundee which currently employs about 50 people. The Unit's first publication on protein kinase profiling was named in 2009 by the Institute for Scientific Information, Philadelphia as Europe's most cited paper in the field of Cel Biology from 1996-2007, with over 2,200 citations. During the collaboration, the Unit has filed 36 patents and 30 licenses have been taken up by the pharmaceutical industry. The DSTT is widely regarded as a model of how academia and industry should interact for which it received a Queen's Anniversary Award for Higher Education which was presented by the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace in February 2006.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body. The new drug was developed employing BRAF enzymes generated by researchers in the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy (DSTT) in the College of Life Sciences at Dundee.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Benefits from DSTT collaboration
The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

GlaxoSmithKline have announced that their BRAF protein kinase inhibitor Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), has been approved by both the European Commission and the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma associated with the BRAF V600E mutation. Unresectable melanoma is that which cannot be removed by surgery, while metastatic melanoma is that which has spread to other parts of the body.

The MRC-PPU benefits in many ways as a result of the DSTT research collaboration.

1. It provides an obvious translational outlet to enable our PIs to exploit their research findings. For example, any PI within the MRC-PPU can rapidly let all six pharmaceutical companies know about any new potential exciting research finding that they have made or any drug target that they have identified or validated. This can lead to major collaborations and stimulate one or more of the pharmaceutical companies to initiate a new drug discovery programme.

2. The research support received from this collaboration is invested in the PPU PIs research programmes and provides additional support to several of our Unit's Scientific service teams including our protein production teams, antibody generation team and cloning team.

3. We obtain key reagents including novel inhibitors, genetically modified cell or mice models from our DSTT pharmaceutical company collaborators.

4. The pharmaceutical companies we collaborate with provide us with important knowledge on the most critical research issues of the day for their drug development programmes. This feedback and industry perspective is extremely useful and helps maximise our overall competitiveness. It ensures that the drug discovery research programmes of the PPU PIs are focussed on addressing the most important questions for better understanding and treating disease.

5. The DSTT collaboration greatly benefits our students and postdocs by providing experience in working with industry via their direct involvement in collaborative experiments with pharmaceutical companies. This provides them with a unique insight into the high quality cutting edge research that is taking place within pharmaceutical companies and gives them an awareness of potential careers in industry. This is particularly important given that one of our main priorities is to train tomorrow's industrial researchers and ensure that the future workforce has the high quality scientific and research support skills that the UK economy will be dependent on.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>All the Programme Leaders in the MRC Protein Phosphorylation Unit have participated in a major collaboration with the pharmaceutical industry since 1998, termed The Division of Signal Transduction Therapy.

The letter, coordinated by Sir David Carter, a former chief medical officer in Scotland, said Scottish universities did disproportionately well out of the UK's research funding system and from the UK's charitable and medical foundation grants.

The audience, consisting of locals, as well as an international contingent of visitors, was engaged and asked numerous questions about the cellular processes Professor Cohen spoke of.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7BEB562F-37C3-462E-9F44-C684C33768FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My talk to the general public at the Australian Academy of Sciences in Canberra in May was broadcast live on the Australian Academy of Sciences internet system.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://aas.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/science-at-the-shine-dome-2016/sats2016/Agenda/AgendaItemDetail?id=9f81f609-299b-4d33-8ec4-cda2a227a66c</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Teaching young children about microbes and the immune system</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2ED6B3B5-1968-404B-862B-99E05007827C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nicola Darling and Kristopher Clark, postdoctoral researchers employed on the grant, participated in an event called &amp;quot;Incredible Immunology&amp;quot;, which was a two day public outreach programme, organised by the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee. It took place at the Dundee Science Centre and was aimed at introducing the immune system and the ways in which research is carried out in this field. The first day was targeted at primary school children and about 125 attended, whilst the second day was attended by members of the general public, mostly families.

Nicol Darling also participated in Open Doors Day in which the School of Life Sciences at the University of Dundee shows the general public around the building. As part of this event members of the public were invited to learn more about the research being carried out at the MRC Protein Phosphorylation and Ubiquitylation Unit with about 100 people attending. The main topics were the brain and cancer introduced through interactive games and opther activities. 

Nicola Darling was also involved in teaching 160 S1 pupils (aged 11-12 years) at the Baldragon Academy high school. The aim of her class on was to help the students to improve their understanding of acids, alkalis and pH, and to encourage their enthusiasm for science by performing experiments. In addition Nicola demonstrated a more complex experiment and answered questions from the children about careers in science.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview with ZDF (German National Public Broadcasting) Regarding Scottish Referendum</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61418BFB-1E58-4A48-A152-43863568F2A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ZDF wished to interview Professor Cohen regarding the risks for life sciences in an independent Scotland for their European affairs programme that wished to discuss an economic case for and against independence.

Waldenstrom's lymphoma is caused by mutations in the protein MyD88, and 95% of the patients who are afflicted by this disease express the same mutant in which the leucine residue at position 265 is changed to proline. MyD88 is an essential adaptor protein in the signalling networks that are triggered by the binding of bacterial and viral components to Toll-Like Receptors or by the interaction of interleukins 1, 18 and 33 with their receptors.


Philip's talk to an audience that mainly comprised patients with Waldenstrom's lymphoma, their physicians, relatives and friends, focused on how MyD88 was discovered, and its key role in the innate immune system that is vital for protection against infection by microbial pathogens, especially during childhood. He also explained how the hyper-activation of the MyD88-dependent signalling network can lead to autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, and how its constitutive activation caused by the MyD88[Leu265Pro] mutation leads to lymphoma. The talk was followed by a formal dinner in the Churchill rooms, at which Philip and Tricia Cohen were the guests of honour.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other
