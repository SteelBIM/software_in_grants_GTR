Generation Networks Systems and Services</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/G053847/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This UK-India consortium-based initiative has been established in direct response to a previous request from the British High Commission in India. The IU-ATC consortium has developed through a series of workshops supported by EPSRC and the British High Commission in India, commencing with a Technical Workshop in January/February 2006. The consortium comprises 8 research-leading universities in UK, 5 leading IITs, major industrial partners in UK and India (including companies such as BT, InfoSys, Wipro, Sasken, and Tejas), and a number of SMEs. The initiative aims to establish the first virtual India-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC) in Next Generation Networks, Systems and Services, which will put in place the support infrastructure to facilitate, develop and enable the Digital Economy of both countries. This will be achieved through scientific investigation of the technical and functional requirements of Next Generation Networks through the promotion of industry collaboration with research-leading academic institutions and government departments as part of an initial 30 month Phase 1 of an overall 5-year joint programme between the UK and India. The current proposal builds on the existing and well formed consortium, which has already attracted EPSRC support (Travel Grant GR1, INTERACT 5 GR2), UKTI Grant, GOF, and most recently UKIERI-DST Research Award (S083). The explosive growth in advanced telecommunication networks and multimedia services in the last decade has offered exciting opportunities across a wide range of sectors, including communications, education, entertainment, and health. These opportunities have been successfully embraced within Europe and USA, and there is an increasing need to provide similar opportunities for the rapidly expanding economy of India. However, given India's special requirements, this cannot easily be achieved by transference of existing technical and engineering solutions, and a fundamental rethink is required to adapt or develop novel solutions and provide for research, innovation and wealth creation opportunities between UK and India. The IU-ATC initiative is focused on promotion of the Digital Economy, a priority identified under the recent government Comprehensive Spending Review 2007 . The Digital Economy aims to support research and skilled people to effect early adoption of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) by a variety of user sectors. Understanding and enabling the impact of information, better positions the UK and India to reap the economic and social benefits offered by emerging Telecommunications Engineering hardware and software together with fixed/wireless/mobile Broadband technologies for low cost sensor and user devices, and service delivery platforms. The challenges in exploiting the promise of the technological advances within NGNs, and achieving their potential performance, economic and social returns, require not only a thorough understanding of the lower layers of the communications networking stack but also a strong ability and interest in exploiting the core technologies for citizen-facing applications. This often implies an appreciation of business and government strategies in specific areas such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing and management and requires close collaboration between academia and industry to realise the full potential.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168126</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sydney</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with EU FP7 ResumeNet/University of Sydney</gtr:description><gtr:id>9F6B6F3D-CDF1-4F1D-94BE-5D5D48AA06BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A number of joint publications (this with Paul Smith as co-author in this period) and further research discs ions</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners had an equal share in the project according to their workpackes</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>ResumeNet is funded by the European Union Research Framework Programme 7 (EU FP7).

The centre involves three full professors, one reader, five senior lecturers and one lecturer, in addition to a dedicated member of staff managing the flagship Masters program in Cyber Security. This centre has been funded from a variety of sources including research councils (EPSRC, ESRC), the European Commission, JANET and direct investment from security organisations. The centre?s income from external research grants in the past five years totals &amp;pound;3.52m. Two key aspects distinguish the centre from typical cyber security research: (a) its multi-disciplinary nature that combines traditional network security and communications research with approaches from data analysis and human behaviours informed by psychological and linguistic approaches, and (b) its close engagement with users in both governmental organisations and industry. The work being carried out within IU-ATC is instrumental with respect to the infrastructure security research in this initiative.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancaster University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with EPSRC project on ?Understanding and Managing Energy Usage in Future Networks?</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D11A1DE-2634-4E84-BF68-B31B545DC0EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results of this collaboration has mainly helped us to understand the user perspective better and was taken as input in other activities such as the expert questionnaire</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This internal partner has provided test-bed collaboration and has shared results from their end-user interaction with us.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The EPSRC project on ?Understanding and Managing Energy Usage in Future Networks? deals with issues on how to minimise end-to-end (servers, networks and clients) energy usage in networked infrastructures by combining centrally planned management actions with end-user participation in the management process.

Additionally, 1 PhD thesis and 3 Master dissertations have been completed in Lancaster in areas related to IU-ATC Theme 4.

The IU-ATC project has established an active collaboration framework between the UK and Indian partners, both in academia and industry. This allowed us to jointly explore and combine expertise (from the UK and Indian sides) in a multi-level network resilience framework for end-to-end monitoring of Internet threats.

Research results obtained in IU-ATC Theme 4 have gained significant media attention and promoted the research to the wider public. In particular, initial results of our survey on Future and Emerging Threats to Network Operation have been widely publicised in the Internet and featured in important IT news broadcasters, including ZDNet UK and Computer World UK. This has generated considerable public interest and helped to engage policy makers and experts at different levels.

The research aspects investigated in IU-ATC Theme 4 have attracted considerable R&amp;amp;D investment, in the form of two joint CASE studentships with BT Labs and another CASE Studentship with EADS.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D464C552-0B2F-4AC7-B867-8BA2515B0772</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The work developed within IU-ATC Theme 4 produced three major findings. These findings are not only research and technical findings but also findings with respect to the perception of key-resileince properties of future and emerging threats within the expert domain. Hence, the project has produced results in major research areas but also have got findings that are relevant in a context beyond the research domain. The key findings are:



 (1) Policy-based management provides flexibility in the configuration of system/network components to adapt in response to events and context changes. We have found this to be a key property when building resilient systems and networks, as the range and nature of the attacks a network may face cannot be fully anticipated; (2) More robust resilience strategies are characterised by an holistic approach based on the end-to-end monitoring of Internet threats, at both edge and core networks (horizontally), and at different layers of the protocol stack (vertically); (3) While concentrating on malicious traffic attacks or data integrity, industry experts and researchers may be underestimating the threat to Internet security posed by physical attacks to telecommunications infrastructure.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work developed within IU-ATC has helped us to attract significant R&amp;amp;D investment through a number of CASE studentships with BT Labs and EADS, and the consolidation of the Lancaster Cyber Security Centre of Excellence. We are also further developing the use of policy-based management strategies and multi-level network resilience in collaborations with our industry partners. We have been developing the work on management policies, multi-level network resilience and the investigation of future threats through a number of academic collaborations, both in Lancaster as well as in India, Australia and in the US. Also, we have been discussing the impact of some of these aspects with our industry partners, e.g., BT Labs. Hence, the exploration routes are o the one hand through traditional scientific and research exploitation and on the other hand target industrial partnerships</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC6025A9-9319-4F2C-B4EB-E1BC7AD74531</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/resilience/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Future and Emerging Threats to Network Operation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92519CEB-DC88-480B-81CD-02F45C9393C3</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Policy-driven Resilience Simulator implemented within IU-ATC Theme 4 has been used in Lancaster as the main experimental platform for the evaluation of resilience strategies. This toolset is based on the integration between the OMNeT++ simulation environment and the Ponder2 policy framework. It offers a platform that allows the simulation of attack scenarios, and the implementation and evaluation of a range of resilience strategies. It has been used in several published papers in the scope of the IU-ATC. 



The toolset has also been used in Lancaster University as the main platform for the development of a number of master dissertations. The toolset is publicly available for download (http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/resilience/software) and we expect that it will continue to be used by students both from Lancaster and from other institutions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FBD1B7C2-ECE6-49C3-9E6D-6DEA795076A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The software has been used by a number of international partners in India, Austria, Australia and
