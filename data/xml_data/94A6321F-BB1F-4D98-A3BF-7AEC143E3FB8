Focussing on children aged 6-14 of Eastern European migrants; the study provides a unique perspective on the lives of children and young people settling in Scotland as a result of their parents? migration for work purposes. The research explores children?s views on what it is like to start life in another country, what impact family migration has on their relationships and identity, and what are the main challenges they face.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will take place over 21 months. The first stage involves several focus groups with migrant children to identify shared experiences of migration. The second stage consists of detailed case studies of over 20 migrant children between 6-14 years old and their families. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with parents, while children will be invited to take control of the research process through the use of modern technologies such as digital and video cameras. The findings will be disseminated through reports and events suitable for young people, the general public as well as academic audiences, service providers and policy makers.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>185969</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>http://www.migrantchildren.net website</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61221176-81BB-4654-A8E4-594A492A4C0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A website providing information on research conducted with Eastern European migrant children in Scotland and their families and the events planned to promote better service delivery for migrant families.

experiences of Eastern European migrant children who follow their families abroad and 
whose experiences has been generally absent from the literature on migration or public 
debate on migration. It gave the young participants a voice and recognition that their 
experiences are shared and also recognised the difficulties they are faced with, while also 
giving them an opportunity to offer ideas on how provision can be improved to support 
migrant families with children, who are not asylum seekers or refugees. 
It also engaged with public policy debates and discussions on the agency of migrant 
children, opportunities for integration and services available, as well as the long-term 
impact of children's migration on their identity, sense of belonging, family and peer 
relationships and participation in the civic society. Finally, the project provided insights 
to practitioners and policy makers on how children deal with family migration and 
resettlement and raised the awareness of teachers and other professionals on the support 
young people require and how they can enhance young people's opportunities for 
inclusion and civic participation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>52DE4102-B6AE-4D5B-8B0B-B5D408539874</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project aimed to provide a unique understanding of the experiences of Eastern European 
children settling in Scotland since 2004 as a result of their parents' migration for work purposes. 
It explored the effect of family migration on children's lives, their family and peer relationships, 
and sense of identity. It also aimed to identify the main challenges children were faced with after 
migration, their coping strategies in response to the new social and institutional environments 
and their views on public and private services available to them. 
Data was collected through focus groups and family case studies, using child-centred research 
methods. In total, 57 children from 10 Eastern European countries participated in focus groups 
and 22 in-depth family case studies were completed. In addition, 19 interviews were carried out 
with service providers (education, leisure, health) working with migrant families and 120 teachers 
participated in small group discussions. 
Findings revealed that despite their lack of agency in the migration process, children showed great 
adaptability skills and adjusted well to life in Scotland, learning English and making new friends. 
Their experiences varied considerably, depending on their family circumstances and their own 
resilience. School was the main service accessed by migrant children, and enjoying school and 
feeling accepted were key to their general experience of migration. Whilst political debate and 
policy has focussed on restrictions on new migrants, a more positive and coherent approach is 
needed to provide support and appropriate services for new migrant groups, especially children.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project findings provide insights

inclusion and civic participation. They can also be used to inform debates on migration and young people's experiences of relocation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4B51AB67-5C7F-4652-97F7-8AFEF6EB7C7B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.migrantchildren.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A10CC65E-15F3-41CA-9282-50F00E884E21"><gtr:id>A10CC65E-15F3-41CA-9282-50F00E884E21</gtr:id><gtr:title>Eastern European children's family and peer relationships after migration : implications for policy and practice</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/71c4249a4489de85cbae876d186ee2ec"><gtr:id>71c4249a4489de85cbae876d186ee2ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fox, R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4B7462CF-A6A8-43D5-B25D-BA0325A0D6F3"><gtr:id>4B7462CF-A6A8-43D5-B25D-BA0325A0D6F3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Migrant Children, Social Capital and Access to Services Post-Migration: Transitions, Negotiations and Complex Agencies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Children &amp; Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e8e5ae6499d930da97cefd92edd8477c"><gtr:id>e8e5ae6499d930da97cefd92edd8477c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sime D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A872912D-D273-4F63-9C8D-218DF91CEC3D"><gtr:id>A872912D-D273-4F63-9C8D-218DF91CEC3D</gtr:id><gtr:title>At home abroad: A guide for migrant parents on services in Scotland (2013)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be1c6f1ea5c9f8647c12dc10b5efeb3f"><gtr:id>be1c6f1ea5c9f8647c12dc10b5efeb3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sime, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EE13996C-512C-4990-ABF0-42433C6F022F"><gtr:id>EE13996C-512C-4990-ABF0-42433C6F022F</gtr:id><gtr:title>At home abroad: The life experiences of children of Eastern European migrant workers in Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be1c6f1ea5c9f8647c12dc10b5efeb3f"><gtr:id>be1c6f1ea5c9f8647c12dc10b5efeb3f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sime, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D9EA693A-21ED-4A27-95B2-B8B4A767859D"><gtr:id>D9EA693A-21ED-4A27-95B2-B8B4A767859D</gtr:id><gtr:title>'I think that Polish doctors are better': newly arrived migrant children and their parents?
