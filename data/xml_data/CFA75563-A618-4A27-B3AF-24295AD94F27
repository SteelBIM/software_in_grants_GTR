Digital Economy</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K025619/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Balance Network will provide a new, interdisciplinary research community to explore Work-Life Balance in the Digital Economy (WLB in DE). It will cultivate new linkages and promote exchanges within and beyond the research base of projects funded under the theme of Sustainable Society: Achieving work-life balance in a digitally dependent world. Through a range of virtual and face-to-face interactions the network will support new, collaborative, multidisciplinary research proposals that develop into virtual centres of excellence. As well as supporting funded projects the network aims to create opportunities for interaction between diverse communities over the next 3 years. It aims to provide resources and activities to bring about a critical mass of expertise thus ensuring a strong foundation for the continuation of the network beyond 2016. The Balance Network will operate as an interdisciplinary community of practice to not only support to core network membership but also engage the wider network membership. The open nature of the network will provide opportunities to share research and engage with a wide variety of individuals and organisations including government, opinion-formers and policy makers, the general public, public and private sector organisations. The network will: 
 - Support communication and collaboration across the funded research projects 
 - Foster a research community of multi-disciplinary teams to further explore the ideas generated on WLB in DE
 - Discuss future funding opportunities, form collaborative bids and provide a forum for peer review between members.
 - Facilitate discussion and the exchange of knowledge between network participants and wider audiences including the public, business and industrial as well as academics. 
 - Compile and disseminate activities and findings of WLB in DE projects and related activities to the wider academic and other communities, including. promotion of work under the Digital Economy Theme across the Research Councils 
 - Provide a coherent 'home' for the projects and to act as a single point of communication for theme of WLB in DE, from a UK and International perspective.
Aim to achieve a critical mass by widening the network to other national and international groups in order to provide self-sufficiency beyond EPSRC support</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Proposed Balance Network: Exploring Work-Life Balance in the Digital Economy aims to build on the Creativity Greenhouse activities which brought together over 16 researchers, mentors and facilitators for an intensive discussion over 2 days face-to-face and 4 days online. It will build on the creative and intellectual collaborations generated during the intensive Creativity workshop and support the funded projects. However the proposed network will continue to build on the collaborations built during the Creativity Greenhouse, o generate new ideas for future projects and to support all members of the network not just the funded projects. The three levels of network membership will ensure that the research findings from the core network are disseminated and shared with a wider research group interested in WLB in DE. The Balance Network will also collate resources from other sources including the wider network and recorded events and webinars as well as providing a social network to share experiences and facilitate debate and discussion in an open network. 
The ultimate beneficiaries of the collaborative research will be the societal. The research projects working together with the Balance Network, offer a significant academic platform from which has the potential to transform lifestyles and improve quality of life, having an impact on society as a whole. In the short term, the beneficiaries will be academic researchers who are influenced by the activities of the Network and its projects. The case studies within the projects will also offer engagement with specific social and industrial communities in the early stages. As the projects develop and the network activities engage a range of audiences it is anticipated that government and industry will benefit. Therefore it is intended that the network will operate as an interdisciplinary Community of Practice for researchers and the wider community interested in issues of WLB in the DE. Thus the Balance Network will not only support the research activities of the funded projects but also support the network as a community of practice. As a result the network has the potential to provide benefits to organisations and institutions regarding WLB in DE and not just to academic researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>114818</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Balance Network funded the production of videos based on The Digital Brain Switch (DBS) project's research.

This workshop aimed to open a debate on changed work life balance realities in a digital world.

Overview:
Technologies have had a massive impact on society and transformed how we work, live and experience travel. Social and mobile technologies have particularly enabled people to connect on an unprecedented scale, with any device, anywhere and at any time. While technologies enhance our professional and private lives in numerous ways, there is increasing evidence that people are no longer 'switching off'. Leisure travel, grounded in the motivation of escapism and the reversal of everyday life, has traditionally had the purpose to switch off, refresh and restore body and mind. What happens however if 'going off the grid' is no longer an option in our hyper-connected and work-centred lifestyles?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://balancenetwork.bimserver2.com/index.php/events/item/67-going-off-the-grid-can-employees-really-switch-off-during-travel?</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Design-led Inquiry for Mobile Lives, CHI workshop, May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A09CD95B-B3EB-40E2-B900-262580938411</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In May 2015, held at the ACM CHI conference on 19th April 2015, the workshop, entitled Design Led Inquiry for Mobile Lives, brought together design researchers and practitioners from a number of fields to explore the role of design led inquiry in addressing the challenges and opportunities brought on by new patterns of mobile living and working.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/mlives/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conversation pieces: two-hour workshop sessions, London, 12 and 13 December, 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D7FE18E-EDEC-4237-AB0E-0EDFE3106336</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conversation pieces.

Overview 
The development of a fast and reliable internet, new technologies, new online payment systems and changes in work structure have driven a shift to new forms of labour exchange such as the outsourcing of work online or 'crowdsourcing'. The one day seminar explored how crowdsourcing has changed the boundary between work and home, enabling older people to remain part of the labour force and perhaps achieve a new work-life balance. 

The aims of the seminar were to:
?Foster interdisciplinary dialogue by bringing together key stakeholders to debate issues of work-life balance, crowdsourcing and prolonged work life
?Contribute to future research that would examine crowdsourcing from a worker perspective to inform policy.

The seminar:
?Examined if, and how, crowdsourcing has changed the boundary between work and home;
?Explored current understandings of the role technology can play in achieving and/or disrupting work-life balance;
?Identified enablers and barriers to engaging in internet-enabled work and achieving a balance;
?Determined whether opportunities for paid work through crowdsourcing platforms offer a way to achieve a better balance in a prolonged working life.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://balancenetwork.bimserver2.com/index.php/events/item/68-prolonging-working-life-through-ict-the-role-of-crowdsourcing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Women's Engineering Society - 22 April 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06C4120D-8C51-4640-86CA-6A2405328942</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Communications Coordinator of the Balance Network gave a presentation to the Women's Engineering Society in April 2016 introducing the Balance Network and its members and to talk about the networks' past activities and upcoming events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Beyond Balance: One-Day Symposium, London, 27 June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>457F920F-BF9F-4E78-A351-2FA07E9B34AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This one-day event was the major conference for the Balance Network.

Attendees worked together to produce design proposals that give materiality to gender differences in the ways we use technology for separating or integrating home and work life. Using sketches, collages, or low-fidelity modelling, these might deal with the complex interweaving of identities (e.g. as worker and mother), while others might address the ways we use the same technologies for work, socialising, domestic planning and play.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://designledexplorations.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital scholars in a mobile world: symposium exploring work-life balance in academic life.

1) Informed by research by Balance Network members, and co-led by the Balance Network PI Dr Rosie Robison, staff at Anglia Ruskin University in 2016 founded the 'Part Time &amp;amp; Flexible Working staff forum'. The forum supports in particular staff who work flexibly/part time at Higher Education Institutions, and who increasingly make use of technology to facilitate this. This forum has grown quickly to 150 members, and co-ran events in November 2015 with Balance Network member Jessica Chivers (of the talent keeper specialists). We believe it is the most developed such staff network at a UK HEI. This links in with wider UK university engagement in the Athena Swan accreditation process. 
2) The network has engaged in particular with a number of small businesses operating in the digital technology space (e.g. Shine Offline, digital mindfulness, Think Productive). Through attending Balance Network events, cutting edge research being undertaken across UK institutions has thus fed into the delivery of practical courses, workshops and podcasts from UK businesses.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0FA3F6FB-44D7-419B-9426-FA31AA33DCF6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Balance Network was created through an EPSRC 'Creativity Greenhouse' event in 2012, on the theme of Work Life Balance in the Digital Economy. The network's overall purpose has been to facilitate the continued interdisciplinary approach to this area of research. Specific objectives of the network have included supporting communication and collaboration across RCUK funded research projects under the same theme (in particular the three 'sister' projects: Digital Brain Switch, Digital Epiphanies, and Family Rituals 2.0); fostering a research community of multi-disciplinary teams to form collaborative bids, facilitate discussion and exchange knowledge; and interacting with wider audiences to explore and share experience in relation to Work Life Balance.

One of the most significant contributions of the network has been the diversity of activities it has fostered and supported, co-led by academics across 25 UK universities (from business, computer science, communication, design, education, engineering, geography, human computer interaction, psychology, sociology, STS, tourism, and the visual arts) and the large interdisciplinary network it has thus built. The 20+ Balance Network activities run since Jan 2014 have included seminars, workshops, conferences, working parties, webinars, artist-led 'caf&amp;eacute;s', online videos, and participatory diary studies, many of which have involved those from business and policy, as well as members of the public. We have supported early career researchers in co-leading seven of these activities. Links between the sister projects have also been strengthened through the network, with investigators and researchers from all three projects having led on network activities. A particular highlight was the 'Beyond Balance' conference in June 2016, at which eight Balance Network activities came together to present sessions.

Major outcomes of the network to date include strong links to a number of other key networks and initiatives, again combining a wide range of disciplines (from the Switched On Culture Research Group and British Psychological Society Work-Life Balance working group, the US-based Work and Family Researchers Network, the Digital Sociologist and digital mindfulness blogs, to the Institute of Engineering and Technology); publicly available resources from a Working Paper series on daily life, digital technology and energy demand, to a 'Microboundary' strategy booklet; increased media coverage and public awareness of events discussing switching off during leisure time, and legislation on the use of email; videos exploring work-life boundaries; and a number of ongoing collaborative follow-on activities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of ongoing activities which have been initiated and/or supported through Balance Network activities, which are expected to produce further outputs in the short and medium term. These include:
- additional academic publications papers on: microboundaries (led by Marta Cecchinato); life-swapping personal data (Dr Anya Skatova); work life balance of IT workers (Dr Penny Hart); interdisciplinary research questions related to digital lives (Dr Rosie Robison)
- a collaborative bid on balancing work &amp;amp; military spouse life in the digital age (led by Dr Lisa Wood)
- presentations and workshops at the CHI 2017 conference on 'Designing for Ambivalence' (led by Paulina Yurman) and 'Quantified Data and Social Relationships' (Dr Rowanne Fleck)
- policy papers on digi housework (led by Prof Gillian Symon), and ICT skills and online platforms for social inclusion (Dr Sally-Anne Barnes)
The network culminated in a 1-day academic workshop in January 2017 with representatives involved in the digital economy strand of three UK Research Councils (AHRC, EPSRC, and ESRC). This stimulating workshop helped feed into the current programme of events being undertaken by the ESRC on 'Ways of Being in a Digital Age', with future funding opportunities expected.
