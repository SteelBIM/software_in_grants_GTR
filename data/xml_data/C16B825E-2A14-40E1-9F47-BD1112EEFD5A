Complexity refers to situations where many simple interacting parts produce an unexpected collective behaviour. This calls for another imprecise concept that is emergence. Complex systems can display the emergence of properties at the macroscopic level that are not found at the microscopic level. One important example of emergence is self-organization. Self-organisation occurs as parts of a complex adaptive system, such as oil molecules in a thin layer, self-organise to form patterns in a state that is statistically stable. The basic mechanism for self organisation comes from feedback. Each part can communicate with its neighbours and arrange into a common collective behaviour. Sometimes, regardless the precise dynamics of the interactions, the evolution of the system is represented by some statistically stable state. This means that this steady state is an 'attractor' in the phase space for the system dynamics and accounts for the robustness of complex systems with respect to external perturbation. The Properties of a complex physical system are emergent just in case they are neither (i) properties had by any parts of the system taken in isolation nor (ii) resultant of a mere summation of properties of parts of the system. The above definition of emergence shows how this process may apply to many systems across all length scales and complexity scales.

The EmergeNET network was funded following the The EPSRC IDEAS Factory on Emergence, which tackled all of these
issues and resulted in a number of funded projects.

The need for a network to cover emergence across disciplines became apparent during the sandpit and led to the allocation of funding to support it.

The EmergeNET network proved to be a useful device to engage a wider number of researchers in the transdisciplinary
discourse around Emergence, but also to create a synergy amongst all the project funded through the EPSRC IDEAS
Factory on Emergence.

EmergeNET events facilitated the mantaining of good communication between those involved in the projects, to further address the outcomes of the sandpit, and to encourage interdisplinary communication surrounding complexity and emergence. Furthermore EmergeNET events opened up the work carried out within each of the projects funded byt the EPSRC IDEAS Factory on Emergence to a much wider, international, research community, creating the conditions for exchanges and further research developments.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The network created a truly multidisciplinary forum to share ideas.
