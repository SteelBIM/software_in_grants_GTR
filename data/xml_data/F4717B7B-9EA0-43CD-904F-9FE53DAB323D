study will investigate the experiences of women donating eggs for stem cell research. In exchange for their eggs, women will receive cheaper IVF treatment.
Stem cell research promises much for the treatment of diseases. Such treatments will be improved if the problem of a patient rejecting stem cells from an unrelated donor can be solved. A technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT: also known as ?therapeutic cloning?) will help to overcome this difficulty. 
More research is required to improve SCNT techniques but there is a shortage of human eggs. Therefore this ?egg sharing? scheme has been proposed. This scheme has been approved by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. 
However, concerns have been raised, including: objections to embryo experimentation; fears that therapeutic cloning will lead to reproductive cloning; views that reduced IVF fees constitute an inappropriate inducement to egg sharers; questions whether egg sharers understand the research to which they are contributing. Therefore it is vital that SCNT research is accompanied by evaluations of its potential benefits and costs. 
This study will provide such an evaluation and supply vital evidence to inform the deliberations and practices of policymakers, stem cell scientists, fertility clinicians, and the wider community, worldwide.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This study takes place at a time of rapid developments in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research and the need for human eggs and embryos for such research. hESC research promises much for future therapies, especially the possibility that patients with diseases resulting from the degeneration of certain cell types (e.g. Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, heart and liver disease) will have the chance to replace these cells. Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) research is needed, as transplanting genetically unrelated cell lines into a patient will provoke an immune response. Nuclear reprogramming, through SCNT, and the derivation of stem cell lines, enables the development of patient and disease specific cell lines to avoid this problem. This is achieved by taking out the nucleus from a (donated) human egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a somatic cell (e.g. a skin cell) from a patient; when activated, the resulting cell divides and ES cells which are genetically similar to the patient can be derived. There is a shortage of human eggs for this research so an egg sharing scheme, in which IVF patients will be offered reduced fees in exchange for some of their eggs, has been proposed (and approved by the HFEA). 

However questions arise over the social and ethical aspects of this work. These include: concerns over embryo experimentation; fears of the ?slippery slope? from therapeutic to reproductive cloning; whether a reduction in IVF fees constitutes an inappropriate inducement to egg sharers; whether egg sharers fully understand the research to which they are contributing. Therefore it is vital that SCNT research is accompanied by robust social and ethical evaluations. The proposed study will provide just such an evaluation by investigating the views, values and experiences of those coming forward to donate eggs, in order to evaluate whether the potential scientific and therapeutic gains from SCNT are achieved at social and ethical costs to egg sharers. 

This will be the first empirical study of this subject; it will provide vital evidence to inform the deliberations and practices of policymakers, stem cell scientists, fertility clinicians, and the wider community, in the UK and worldwide. The study will also build upon a current Wellcome Trust funded project investigating the social and ethical aspects of embryo donation for hESC research.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>296300</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Johns Hopkins University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Berman Institute of Bioethics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Provision and Acquisition of Reproductive Tissue for Science (PARTS) International Research Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B4C274F-7439-4DAA-99B3-73323312A8EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Membership of the Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

In March / April 2010 the PI was a Visiting Professor in the Department of
Sociology, Monash University, Melbourne and also Flinders University, Adelaide. She delivered presentations to the Department of Sociology in Monash and the School of Nursing and Midwifery in Flinders University. Both presentations offered reflections on the challenges of interdisciplinary research and the nature of collaboration between the fields of Sociology and Bioethics. The University of Sydney organised an international one day workshop focusing on the PARTS research network. The PI presented two papers discussing the work of the PARTS International Research Network and some preliminary findings from this MRC funded research project.
In March 2011 the PI was visiting Professor at Otago University, New Zealand and presented preliminary findings from the project.
In October 2011 the PI and RA led a successful proposal to host a symposium within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress to be held in Rotterdam, June 2012; 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?'. This involved an international panel of PARTS members including colleagues from Dalhousie, Sydney and Flinders Universities as well as the PI and RA.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contact through our PARTS network with members of the various international research centres and University departments, identified as collaborators, assists our project by helping us to locate the UK issues and experiences within an international comparative context. This in turn assists the production of a better informed, more robust, analysis. The PARTS network also provides access to other networks; for example links forged through PARTS have been a factor in an invitation for the PI to join the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Ethics and Public Policy Committee. Members of the network in Australia issued invitations to present our research in 2010. A worldwide group of members came together in Rotterdam in 2012 to participate in a symposium organised by PARTS members and hosted within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PI founded PARTS in 2009; she launched it via the Policy Ethics and Life Sciences (PEALS) Research Centre website, and she has initiated a number of meetings.
A workshop took place in Sydney University, Australia, 23/03/2010, where she presented on this research project. Further presentations took place in Melbourne and Adelaide through connections made via the PARTS International Research Network.
The PI also visited a number of centres in New Zealand between March and April 2011. A presentation and meetings in Otago and meetings in Auckland and Wellington were closely connected to the work of the MRC project, though the trip was funded by other sources. (A further presentation, planned for Christchurch had to be cancelled owing to the 2011 earthquake.)
Under the banner of PARTS and in collaboration with several PARTS members, the PI and RA submitted a proposal to host a symposium as part of the International Association of Bioethics, World Congress of Bioethics in Rotterdam in June 2012. This was successful and the symposium 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?' took place. The PI presented on 'Is it more ethically challenging to provide human embryos or human eggs for stem cell research?', drawing on the work of the MRC project and previous Wellcome Trust funded research. This event was attended by over 75 international delegates from a range of disciplines and professions and generated considerable interest, discussion and many positive comments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Theology and Religion</gtr:department><gtr:description>Provision and Acquisition of Reproductive Tissue for Science (PARTS) International Research Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>BFE01CB1-83A8-46A5-880D-D3ECD1A01668</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Membership of the Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

In March / April 2010 the PI was a Visiting Professor in the Department of
Sociology, Monash University, Melbourne and also Flinders University, Adelaide. She delivered presentations to the Department of Sociology in Monash and the School of Nursing and Midwifery in Flinders University. Both presentations offered reflections on the challenges of interdisciplinary research and the nature of collaboration between the fields of Sociology and Bioethics. The University of Sydney organised an international one day workshop focusing on the PARTS research network. The PI presented two papers discussing the work of the PARTS International Research Network and some preliminary findings from this MRC funded research project.
In March 2011 the PI was visiting Professor at Otago University, New Zealand and presented preliminary findings from the project.
In October 2011 the PI and RA led a successful proposal to host a symposium within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress to be held in Rotterdam, June 2012; 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?'. This involved an international panel of PARTS members including colleagues from Dalhousie, Sydney and Flinders Universities as well as the PI and RA.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contact through our PARTS network with members of the various international research centres and University departments, identified as collaborators, assists our project by helping us to locate the UK issues and experiences within an international comparative context. This in turn assists the production of a better informed, more robust, analysis. The PARTS network also provides access to other networks; for example links forged through PARTS have been a factor in an invitation for the PI to join the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Ethics and Public Policy Committee. Members of the network in Australia issued invitations to present our research in 2010. A worldwide group of members came together in Rotterdam in 2012 to participate in a symposium organised by PARTS members and hosted within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PI founded PARTS in 2009; she launched it via the Policy Ethics and Life Sciences (PEALS) Research Centre website, and she has initiated a number of meetings.
A workshop took place in Sydney University, Australia, 23/03/2010, where she presented on this research project. Further presentations took place in Melbourne and Adelaide through connections made via the PARTS International Research Network.
The PI also visited a number of centres in New Zealand between March and April 2011. A presentation and meetings in Otago and meetings in Auckland and Wellington were closely connected to the work of the MRC project, though the trip was funded by other sources. (A further presentation, planned for Christchurch had to be cancelled owing to the 2011 earthquake.)
Under the banner of PARTS and in collaboration with several PARTS members, the PI and RA submitted a proposal to host a symposium as part of the International Association of Bioethics, World Congress of Bioethics in Rotterdam in June 2012. This was successful and the symposium 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?' took place. The PI presented on 'Is it more ethically challenging to provide human embryos or human eggs for stem cell research?', drawing on the work of the MRC project and previous Wellcome Trust funded research. This event was attended by over 75 international delegates from a range of disciplines and professions and generated considerable interest, discussion and many positive comments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Porto Medical School</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Portugal, Portuguese Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Portugese comparative study</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E35F3BB-6E39-493B-A9A7-675A47F6ADBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project has produced a number of outputs:

Under the banner of PARTS and in collaboration with several PARTS members, the PI and RA submitted a proposal to host a symposium as part of the International Association of Bioethics, World Congress of Bioethics in Rotterdam in June 2012. This was successful and the symposium 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?' took place. The PI presented on 'Is it more ethically challenging to provide human embryos or human eggs for stem cell research?', drawing on the work of the MRC project and previous Wellcome Trust funded research. This event was attended by over 75 international delegates from a range of disciplines and professions and generated considerable interest, discussion and many positive comments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Sociology and Social Policy</gtr:department><gtr:description>Provision and Acquisition of Reproductive Tissue for Science (PARTS) International Research Network</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C596A6E-43DC-452D-B6A0-7D95FE0A4ABE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Membership of the Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the International Society for Stem Cell Research.

Both presentations offered reflections on the challenges of interdisciplinary research and the nature of collaboration between the fields of Sociology and Bioethics. The University of Sydney organised an international one day workshop focusing on the PARTS research network. The PI presented two papers discussing the work of the PARTS International Research Network and some preliminary findings from this MRC funded research project.
In March 2011 the PI was visiting Professor at Otago University, New Zealand and presented preliminary findings from the project.
In October 2011 the PI and RA led a successful proposal to host a symposium within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress to be held in Rotterdam, June 2012; 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?'. This involved an international panel of PARTS members including colleagues from Dalhousie, Sydney and Flinders Universities as well as the PI and RA.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contact through our PARTS network with members of the various international research centres and University departments, identified as collaborators, assists our project by helping us to locate the UK issues and experiences within an international comparative context. This in turn assists the production of a better informed, more robust, analysis. The PARTS network also provides access to other networks; for example links forged through PARTS have been a factor in an invitation for the PI to join the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) Ethics and Public Policy Committee. Members of the network in Australia issued invitations to present our research in 2010.

A workshop took place in Sydney University, Australia, 23/03/2010, where she presented on this research project. Further presentations took place in Melbourne and Adelaide through connections made via the PARTS International Research Network.
The PI also visited a number of centres in New Zealand between March and April 2011. A presentation and meetings in Otago and meetings in Auckland and Wellington were closely connected to the work of the MRC project, though the trip was funded by other sources. (A further presentation, planned for Christchurch had to be cancelled owing to the 2011 earthquake.)
Under the banner of PARTS and in collaboration with several PARTS members, the PI and RA submitted a proposal to host a symposium as part of the International Association of Bioethics, World Congress of Bioethics in Rotterdam in June 2012. This was successful and the symposium 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?' took place. The PI presented on 'Is it more ethically challenging to provide human embryos or human eggs for stem cell research?', drawing on the work of the MRC project and previous Wellcome Trust funded research. This event was attended by over 75 international delegates from a range of disciplines and professions and generated considerable interest, discussion and many positive comments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ottawa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Canadian Institute for Health Research</gtr:description><gtr:id>682AD127-F3A1-4543-8572-65A7622692F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcome of this multidisciplinary collaboration between individuals in the named organisations resulted in a successful bid for funding to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and a research project that produced valuable findings.

Sociology, Monash University, Melbourne and also Flinders University, Adelaide. She delivered presentations to the Department of Sociology in Monash and the School of Nursing and Midwifery in Flinders University. Both presentations offered reflections on the challenges of interdisciplinary research and the nature of collaboration between the fields of Sociology and Bioethics. The University of Sydney organised an international one day workshop focusing on the PARTS research network. The PI presented two papers discussing the work of the PARTS International Research Network and some preliminary findings from this MRC funded research project.
In March 2011 the PI was visiting Professor at Otago University, New Zealand and presented preliminary findings from the project.
In October 2011 the PI and RA led a successful proposal to host a symposium within the International Association of Bioethics World Congress to be held in Rotterdam, June 2012; 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?'. This involved an international panel of PARTS members including colleagues from Dalhousie, Sydney and Flinders Universities as well as the PI and RA.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contact through our PARTS network with members of the various international research centres and University departments, identified as collaborators, assists our project by helping us to locate the UK issues and experiences within an international comparative context.

The PI also visited a number of centres in New Zealand between March and April 2011. A presentation and meetings in Otago and meetings in Auckland and Wellington were closely connected to the work of the MRC project, though the trip was funded by other sources. (A further presentation, planned for Christchurch had to be cancelled owing to the 2011 earthquake.)
Under the banner of PARTS and in collaboration with several PARTS members, the PI and RA submitted a proposal to host a symposium as part of the International Association of Bioethics, World Congress of Bioethics in Rotterdam in June 2012. This was successful and the symposium 'Ethical challenges in the uses of human reproductive tissue in scientific research: procurement and protection?' took place. The PI presented on 'Is it more ethically challenging to provide human embryos or human eggs for stem cell research?', drawing on the work of the MRC project and previous Wellcome Trust funded research. This event was attended by over 75 international delegates from a range of disciplines and professions and generated considerable interest, discussion and many positive comments.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of L?beck</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Network on Ethics of Families</gtr:description><gtr:id>9B46432D-CB46-4245-9E0C-2A9E722BA8CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multi-disciplinary collaboration of social scientists, sociologists, ethicists and philosophers who take empirical and theoretical approaches to their work.

Owing to measures followed to protect confidentiality we do not know how many interviewees attended.

Around 40 people attended the event and the range of questions and comments indicated that the presentations had encouraged participants to consider issues they had not previously engaged with. The participants were drawn from a city noted for hosting world class research using human reproductive tissue and so the event will have contributed to ongoing public debate, potentially amongst future researchers and tissue providers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>Keynote/Invited Speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PEALS Annual International Symposium 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1EECCFAE-8646-4B34-8E9B-60A5565403CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Haimes, E.
