The focus of this proposal is to better understand how energy is consumed in SMEs through the analysis of real time data and the development of SME energy management profiles, to study the potential to positively influence occupant behaviour towards an ongoing reduction in consumption and to develop test devices and software that will help verify the viability of new products that could be commercialised to SMEs in UK and overseas markets. 

The project will observe and conduct interviews with staff and building occupants at 15 sites to gather data on building energy use and occupants' behaviour on energy consumption. Sites will be selected to reflect a broad cross section of business and building types and a range of occupancy.

The building energy consumption data and end-user information will be used in developing a system that generates detailed energy consumption profiles for a wide range of SME business types and buildings. The profiles will be used to identify clusters of energy user types according to criteria including sector, occupancy, building type and building use, as well as to identify poor energy performance and wasteful patterns of energy use. This cluster information, together with qualitative data collected from interviews conducted with occupants of SME buildings, will be used to derive targeted requirements specifications for each of those clusters.

Hardware will then be developed to measure real time energy use along side other relevant data sets, such as ambient temperature. Software will be developed to analyse the data and deliver real-time targeted and timely information to building occupants that helps them to make better decisions (and verify the results of good decisions) about energy use such that occupant behaviour changes, leading to persistent energy consumption reduction.

Energy use information will be delivered in a format that responds to the role and responsibility of different end-user types in real time to the customer's preferred hardware device (phone, PC, tablet etc). The user interfaces for accessing this energy use information will be designed using principles from the field of information visualisation, and the range of target hardware will necessitate extending the chosen techniques and designs to work across a range of screen resolutions and
interaction styles such as mouse, touch-screen and stylus.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project focuses on improving the efficiency of energy use in SMEs employing between 10 and 50 people. This represents around 1.2 business in the UK economy. The innovation of effectively being able to monitor and better control energy use on the SME should make for significant cost reductions, especially as environmental taxes are set to become more aggressive. It is anticipated that in the order of 20% saving of energy cost savings is achievable by using the devices and following the procedures developed in this project. This will allow businesses to become more competitive and to retain revenue to invest in growth. Fostering growth in SMEs has positive impact on their customers but also on the economy and will lead to higher employment in this sector. Hence, society as a whole will benefit from economic stimulation, further societal and environmental benefits will arise as a consequence of energy saving and the contribution to reducing CO2 emissions. This is especially so as two thirds of energy consumed in the SME sector is derived from fossil fuels and electricity accounts for 60% of energy costs mainly through fuelling lighting, heating and the use of IT equipment. Clear and significant savings are expected to be observed within twelve months of installing the monitoring devices. Savings will be apparent when energy usage in participating SMEs benchmarked against similar companies in the relevant cluster segment of SMEs.

Improved control of the internal environment of SMEs will also make for enhanced well-being of employees. The nature of the project should promote employee engagement in their company and they will also learn about efficient use of energy - learning which can be transferred into their homes and the community in which they live. The findings will also provide insight on the smart energy systems which is of great value to local and regional governments and may also be relevant to energy managers in the public sector. The connectivity and communication (human &amp;amp; technology) methodology that will be developed in this project can be used by building managers to undertake their duties in a more efficient manner.

Another important impact is in the improved management of building assets. There will be savings in the early reaction time in asset management allowing the production of schedules that are dynamically fed onto BMS software creating a robust delivery of energy with little wastage. This will allow periods of technology degradation to be avoided and the shutting down of building spaces to be minimised. Using the system developed will allow asset management teams to predict downtime periods and to plan ahead to avoid wastage of staff time.

The academic community will benefit by achieving research outputs and publications in refereed journals. A major impact is the development of a database reporting on energy use at 30 minute intervals over the course of one year which can be used to model energy consumption in SMEs. In this dataset external weather conditions are recorded and so can be controlled for in the modelling. This dataset will be made available to other academic researchers and teachers to provide real analytic opportunities for students. Other positive impacts to academics are derived from working with the industrial collaborator and the interdisciplinary team working between energy engineers, computer scientists and statisticians and the contact with energy users in the SME sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>131526</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Energy Technology Partnership (ETP)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Energy Technology Partnership - Energy Systems Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>DF82C6F9-C273-4F78-A213-96599468F2AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None, as yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In its infancy but has developed out of the work undertaken on the Energy Challenge Project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Invited to join as an Energy Systems Theme Group Member in order to:
