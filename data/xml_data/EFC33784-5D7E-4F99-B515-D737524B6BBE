In conjunction with two community organisations, we are seeking to create questions that interrogate divisions, begin to overcome them and develop plans for a cohesive 'communal' future. Methods used and findings from the community project will be articulated, analysed and disseminated in public fora and in academic articles.

This project builds upon two AHRC funded projects. First, Walkerdine et al's research in Abergavenny for the Connected Communities Programme, 'Community as micro-sociality' (2011-12) discovered that Abergavenny as a community is geographically disconnected along north/south fault lines, historically related to class and dislocation. Second, and also attached to the AHRC theme, Mackey et al's project 'Challenging concepts of 'liquid' place through performance practices in community contexts' (2011-14) works with community participants and artists to interrogate people's relationship with their place through performance. The divisions in Abergavenny are marked, from the name given to the area ('The Reservation'), to lack of knowledge by south about the north and vice versa, and the difficulties and differences of being and moving through Abergavenny exhibited by both groups. In this context, provision of community support and services is geographically divided, which roughly equates to a class divide. Uniting these two AHRC projects allows us to approach 'community' as micro sociality and performance in an inclusive manner. Together with representatives from the community groups, we will co-create and co-design a project to identify questions which point to a) how the divisions are experienced and have come about b) how they may be overcome to create provision which is welcoming and supportive of both parts of the community c) draw up plans for a sustainable, communal future, identifying connected and integrated support for community in the light of funding cuts and in spite of historical divisions. 
 This is the agreed starting point and 'hook' for the project. It has been devised through discussion within the steering group as background activity towards this proposal since July. The steering group includes representatives from the two community partners, Communities First North Abergavenny and Abergavenny Community Centre (south Abergavenny) as well as the three research team members and will be joined, in phase two, by members of the local council.
Using a synthesis of arts, humanities and social science methods, the steering group are considering a series of site based performance events influenced by historical research to initially uncover the history of division within the town, as told by local residents. This knowledge will lead us to formulate specific questions for phase 2 about, for example, the context, history and current understanding of the town's divisions. These will form the basis for activities in the second phase which we anticipate will enquire more closely into these divisions, begin to ameliorate the situation and lead to developing longer term plans for conjoined resources and communal living - to be shared with local council and government. Because the methods of research have already been discussed in pre-project steering group meetings, we are likely to use primarily performative methods including, for example, walking and mapping techniques, as well as site-based community performance work.
What is potentially of great benefit to communities - and researchers - is the question of how to develop a methodology coupling a series of techniques and modes of enquiry, capable of creating inclusive self-directional research by communal members, as well as being underpinned by an alternative, holistic arts based approach to community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Because of the open nature of this call where the precise nature of the research will be identified during Phase 1, certain beneficiaries below are unconfirmed until the end of Phase 1 e.g. local businesses. 

Key beneficiaries:
1. The two community organisations of Abergavenny and their residents will benefit directly from this research, which aims to address their particular concerns and needs around town divisions and future cohesions. The development of an effective local governance will have actively involved its citizens and is significant for enhancing the quality of life of local populations.

In addition, we anticipate the following:
2. Because the research addresses significant issues concerning community cohesion and the needs of divided communities in times of austerity, local - and potentially national - government will benefit from accumulated knowledge gathered for them.
3.Community groups will benefit from engaging in research, which they co-create and co-design. It is expected that through working as research partners in this project they will gain experience and knowledge in research methods for future practice in working with, for example, local government and applying for funding.
4.Potentially, local businesses will be involved with Phase 2 of the research project. It is expected that businesses could learn, therefore, from a greater understanding of how residents see and engage with them and so understand how businesses might be sensitive to and responsive to the wishes of local communities with respect to the organisation of space and geography. 
5.The research can contribute to the 'nation's health' by understanding complex affective and emotional aspects of the central experience of relationality, belonging and the place of, and its embodiment through, performance. 
6. The engagement of performance in the research helps involve a wide cross section of the community in the work and develops the skills of community organisations to work with performance. This use of performance helps reach the general public in a popular way, which allows a wide range of citizens to feel included.
7. The project team will gain invaluable interdisciplinary understanding, benefitting researchers and populace alike.

The local impacts should be relatively fast but it will take longer for them to reach a national and international audience. The website, database and support from Cardiff University PR will facilitate wider popular dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99958</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Up the Estate was a musical created by the residents of the North Abergavenny Estate and told the story of the creation and history of the estate via the story of a ficional family.
