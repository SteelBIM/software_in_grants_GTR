It challenges and explores nostalgic stereotypes of the teenage girl, the suburban housewife, the glamorous woman and the woman in love. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Four of the six seminars are complete, focusing on 'Glamour' and 'The Housewife' and two workshops on the interpretation of film and photographic evidence. Remaining seminars will discuss 'the teenager' in February 2011 and 'The Woman in Love', including a reflection on the role of the feminist movement, in May 2011. There is a database of over 70 academics including research students who have contributed to the series as part of their postgraduate training. Details can be found on the seminar programmes website.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Plans for wider dissemination include an edited book and a Journal Special Issue in addition to conference presentations.&lt;/p>

The range of material presented demonstrated that the often overlooked 1950s was a time of profound social, political and economic change for women of all ages. Day long events were held in Manchester, Sussex, Winchester and London and each attracted between 25 and 30 national and international participants working in academia, the media, museums and archives at all stages of their career. Papers presented crossed disciplinary boundaries using a wide range of visual, written and oral evidence. Topics of the seminars were: Glamour, The Housewife, the Teenager, and the Women in Love. They were complemented by two sensory workshops; one working with photographs and one on sound and material artefacts. These workshops generated extensive discussion over the use of these sources within traditional history writing and suggested new ways of working. Each seminar included five to eight presentations by established academics and professionals and post-graduate researchers. The final seminar was held at the Women's Library in London and included a presentation by the archivist highlighting a wealth of as yet untapped material as well as introducing the publications and archives used by members of the seminar. Over the course of the series five postgraduates were awarded their PhDs.

A range of publications (see publications section). 5 post graduates awarded PhDs. Participation in TV series 'Fabric of Britain'. Ongoing networking via database set up through University of Manchester. Invitations to speak to Local history Society, Mothers' Union (Surrey), WI (Hampshire) British Federation of Women Graduates (Winchester ) .
The exposure given to different archive collections and sources for research on the 1950s has widened knowledge of resources and of methods for working with them. Feedback during the course of the Series indicated that participants were starting, or planning, to use these resources in their work. The series attracted delegates and presenters from North America and Israel, establishing the potential for future collaborative work. Networks have been maintained by email, but we aim to build on these through the database and a future seminar offering a global perspective on women in the 1950s. The event will be targeted at academics and archivists/ museum /media professionals.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2009,2010,2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Jo Stanley. life writing workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8544A872-2A65-47AD-8C4C-6E16B1949C0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Also popular talks, including leading a life-writing workshop for the Association of Wrens (ex-Wrens), hosted by National Maritime Museum in Jan 2016.
Jo Stanley reports that her attendance at the seminars sparked a number of activities including the one detailed here 
'Unexpected benefits include being an interviewee for a JMU student researching women's attitudes to pop music in the late 50s- early 60s. My preparation for this was helped by looking at the collection of girls magazines collected on behalf of the JMU Archive by Nicki Anne Moody, who was a participant in the Women in Britain in the 1950s seminars.
The Women in Britain in the 1950 project, and the insights I gained from later doing the reading that seminars inspired, has led to both academic and community outcomes. These have benefited scholars and members of the public both in the UK and in the wider world reached by my publications including the blog.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://genderedseas.blogspot.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The seminar series Women in the 1950s sought to challenge familiar stereotypes of the post-war woman, explore new ways of working with material and visual objects and build capacity amongst new researchers. Invitation to museums and archives representatives to the seminars were intended to build relationships that would enable future collaboration and wider audiences for academic research on this topic. The seminar series was completed four years ago and six Phds have been awarded, extending capacity amongst young researchers, not all of whom will work in academia. The research outputs section demonstrates that publications that were generated by the seminar series are now coming into the public domain. Of particular note in crossing the academic / wider audience are books by Carol Dyhouse and Claire Langhamer which have received wider media attention. Stephanie Spencer has been invited to speak to a range of local history and women's groups in the South East. As research from individual members of the seminar reaches the public domain so we anticipate that the capacity for better understanding of women's lives in the post war period will be recognised and used by the wider public in the next few years. Our immediate audience is likely to be museums and archive services but longer term it is anticipated that understanding post war social change might also be used to inform policy makers or incorporated into the school history curriculum.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6CD1687E-DC9C-4DAD-9042-11CBC0C1DF59</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The six seminar series 'Women in Britain in the 1950s' challenged and investigated the view of women's role in the decade following World War 2 as one of political conservatism and domestically focused activity seen through a lens of nostalgia.

Over the course of the series five postgraduates were awarded their PhDs. The main aims were to: identify where research on women in the 1950s is underway and on what topics, gaps in the field and available archives; build capacity amongst new researchers in the field. 
Seminars were advertised directly by email and through the Women's History Network, Gender and Education Association and the History of Education Society (UK). Notices were also posted on H-Women. 
An initial core of twenty participants grew to an email list of over 80 including librarians, archivists, museum educators and members of U3A and at least fourteen postgraduates. 
 Invited guest speakers included experts on photography, film and material culture. 
 At least fifteen delegates attended four or more seminars resulting in a combination of continuity of discussion and fresh insights as experts brought new members to the series. Where possible each seminar included presentations from both academics and archivists/ museum /media professionals. Each venue had facilities for film and visual presentations allowing for discussion of a range of evidence at each seminar. The title of each event ensured that the experience of women of all ages and classes were explored. The convenors were mindful of the lack of research on non-white women's experience in the 1950s. Although every effort was made to ameliorate this and race/ ethnicity was the focus of papers within two of the seminars, this series highlighted the considerable need for more research in this area. We did not attract delegates from Wales despite our best efforts, suggesting that there is a gap in the research on this topic in this region.
The focus of the seminar brought together delegates (in addition to Manchester, Sussex and Winchester) from London South Bank, Staffordshire, Oxford, Oxford Brookes, Institute of Education London, Newcastle, Stirling, Warwick, Cambridge, Leicester, Open, Royal Holloway, UWE, Leeds Met, Lancaster, KCL, Keele, Nottingham, Rose Bruford, Sheffield, Derby, BBC, Victoria and Albert Museum, Women's Library, Israel, USA, Spain and independent researchers. As those working on this area are so scattered it was particularly valuable to have the opportunity to spend time in face-to- face discussion and to be made aware of where research into the 1950s is taking place. Four men also attended the seminars and one was a regular core member 
In 2015 the core convenors Stephanie Spencer, Penny Tinkler and Claire Langhamer edited a Special Edition of Women's History Review on Women in the 1950s that included articles by seminar participants. Many of the articles are now available online and the Special Edition with introduction will be published early 2017</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main purpose of the seminar series was to provide a forum for established academics and an opportunity for postgraduate students to share their work and develop wider networks, Additionally speakers from the V and A museum and archives as well as the Women's Library enabled further and ongoing discussion as to the wider use of research into women in the 1950s beyond academia. Workshops on using visual sources broadened expertise in this area. Contacts made with those working outside academia built a range of relationships which have resulted in calls for advice on tv and radio programmes and talks to women's groups in the community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>74B23495-779B-413D-BE85-250862A45EC9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/91EAEE0D-EB0E-4B4F-9C05-48168AB40ADD"><gtr:id>91EAEE0D-EB0E-4B4F-9C05-48168AB40ADD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women, Marriage and Paid Work in Post-war Britain</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Women's History Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/32e4ce9ddb032268c62e4110b63f4fcc"><gtr:id>32e4ce9ddb032268c62e4110b63f4fcc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McCarthy H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E8939EC8-DBB7-48E5-A58A-3846D5E4D043"><gtr:id>E8939EC8-DBB7-48E5-A58A-3846D5E4D043</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women and the Media Feminism and Femininity in Britain 1900 to the present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b87f8d030535537d3d779cfaa9487b67"><gtr:id>b87f8d030535537d3d779cfaa9487b67</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ritchie, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-66036-5</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AA8D768A-8F29-4D1F-8BC6-FFC68EE6A2BD"><gtr:id>AA8D768A-8F29-4D1F-8BC6-FFC68EE6A2BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Women and the Media Feminism and Femininity in Britain 1900 to the present</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4014dbe7229b5873ebee9b33106170d1"><gtr:id>4014dbe7229b5873ebee9b33106170d1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Skoog, K.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-66036-5</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D092E935-715A-492F-BA07-CC8A1ABC056F"><gtr:id>D092E935-715A-492F-BA07-CC8A1ABC056F</gtr:id><gtr:title>What Do Women Want?
