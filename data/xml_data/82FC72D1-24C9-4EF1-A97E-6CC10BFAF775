For example, molecular simulations can show drugs bind to their biological targets, how enzymes catalyse reactions, and how proteins fold into their functional forms. Biomolecular simulation is a vibrant and growing area, making increasingly significant contributions to biology. It is an area of growing international importance. Simulations of biological molecules complement experiments in building a molecular-level understanding of biology: they can test hypotheses and interpret and analyse experimental data in terms of interactions at the atomic level. A wide variety of simulation techniques have been developed, applicable to a range of different problems in biomolecular science. Biomolecular simulations have already shown their worth in helping to analyse how enzymes catalyse biochemical reactions, and how proteins adopt their functional structures e.g. within cell membranes. They contribute to the design of drugs and catalysts, and in understanding the molecular basis of disease. Simulations have played a key role in developing the conceptual framework now at the heart of biomolecular science, that is, the understanding that the way that biological molecules move and flex - their dynamics - is central to their function. Developing methods from chemical physics and computational science will open exciting new opportunities in biomolecular science, including in drug development and biotechnology. Much biomolecular simulation demands high end computing (HEC) resources: e.g. large-scale simulations of biological machines such as the ribosome, proton pumps and motors, membrane receptor complexes and even whole viruses. A particular challenge is the integration of simulations across length and timescales: different types of simulation method are required for different types of problems).

Biomolecular Simulations are contributing increasingly to areas such as biotechnology, drug design, biocatalysis and biomedicine. The UK has a strong community in this field, recognized by the recent (2011) establishment by EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface (and the subsequent award of 'widening participation' funds in 2012). We believe there is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for high-end computing in this field, and propose a new HEC Consortium in biomolecular simulation. Working with CCP-BioSim, this Consortium will help bring HEC to a wider community, including non-traditional users and experimental bioscientists, and engage physical and computer scientists in biological applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
As well as biosimulation specialists, a broad cross-section of bioscientists who are concerned, in some way or other, with the nature and behaviour of biomolecules at the atomic level e.g. X-ray crystallographers, NMR spectroscopists, single-molecule biophysicists, mass spectrometrists, enzymologists, medicinal chemists, chemical biologists. It will contribute to synthetic biology, biocatalysis and drug design. The UK High-End Computing Consortium for Biomolecular Simulation will help achieve maximum benefit from national HEC investment. It will assist the biological community to use high-end computing facilities and help physical scientists tackle biological problems. In the longer term, there is the potential for the project to impact on the general public through improvements in health and quality of life.

How will they benefit from this research?
The &amp;quot;molecule-oriented&amp;quot; bioscience community will benefit through access to tools, training, and trained simulation specialists that enable novel and more effective multidisciplinary projects where computational methods enhance and extend their core experimental approaches. Such integrated studies have a higher probability of producing high-impact discoveries and developments and so fostering such activities will enhance UK competitiveness in the international research arena. The Consortium will provide tools and resources to facilitate this. These tools should give rise to major benefits (e.g. high-impact papers, major international grant awards) over the term of the project, and in future. In the longer term the Consortium will be helping train a new generation of bioscientists who can work confidently and knowledgeably across the theory/experimental divide. What is 'state-of-the-art' today with regard to computational power and methodology, and so might be regarded as somewhat esoteric, will be on the desktop of bioscientists in 5-10 years time. Impacts on the health and quality of life of the general public are likely to come primarily from the application of the methodologies fostered and disseminated (e.g. by CCP-BioSim) to drug design and discovery. Computational methods are already well-established in Pharma, since they can hasten and cheapen the process of drug discovery and development. The more computationally-intensive methods of biomolecular simulation are gaining ground, as improvements in computational power make accuracy and time-to-solution competitive with 'wet' methods. The Consortium will help improve this by a) helping train new generations of researchers with the necessary HEC skills and b) providing a forum to enhance industrial-academic research links (members of the Consortium have established links with many large and smaller pharmaceutical/biotech companies (e.g. AZ, Vernalis, Phaminox, GSK, Evotec, J&amp;amp;J, Pfizer, Oxford Nanopore). The benefits to the public in the longer term come from new and/or cheaper medicinal products, plus the potential for simulations has in addressing the 3Rs and biosecurity.

What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research? 
Through close coordination with CCP-BioSim and other bodies: 
- The programme of workshops, co-organised with leading experimentalists in key disciplines, examining and fostering links across the simulation/experimental interface
- The annual conference focused on exemplifying and encouraging the highest quality interdisciplinary research.
- Training workshops introducing non-specialist bioscientists to high quality simulation methods, and specialists to the latest technological advances.
- Associated on-line training packages, available any time, any place.
- Training workshops and tools developed to aid access to HPC resources for those with a bioscience background.

Tools, software and data from development work will be made freely available, and disseminated via the web. Involvement of a wide community will ensure broad uptake</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>288481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Evotec</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial collaboration with EVOTEC</gtr:description><gtr:id>02A388A9-0122-474A-AB16-A2EB25235C49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary involving Computational Chemistry, Chemical Biology, Structural Biology, Cellular Biology and Drug Discovery.

Background
Single paragraph detailing what the HEC Consortium is/does.

HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), , and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, e.g., served on the HECToR Resource Allocation Panel, including the current and previous Chairs of the RAP. The Consortium welcomes new members across the whole community. Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have expressed interest in joining and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see e.g. case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Management
HECBioSim supports three different types of project allocation for time on ARCHER. Pump priming projects are those designed to assist a number of activities (e.g. testing of new codes) and typically fall in the &amp;lt;1MAU range. The standard project is probably the most common and is covered in the 1-15 MAU range. Grand challenge projects are typically projects that fall in the 15-50 MAU range, these are generally large collaborative projects that would involve collaboration on a national scale. Applications are made through the website www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of a series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects (to-date 31 projects). 

We have welcomed several new groups into HECBioSim since our inception - we are open to new members, unlike some Consortia. All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively; any groups in the UK can apply. 

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). To-date, the website has been accessed by over 10,000 unique IPs. Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Highlights for the Current Reporting Period
No more than half a page detailing significant highlights for the period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.

Here we highlight in particular as one example (others are listed in sections below), work of Charlie Laughton (Pharmacy, Nottingham) and Sarah Harris (Physics, Leeds): A new, highly accurate, force field for the simulation of DNA, developed and tested using ARCHER through HECBioSim (as part of a large international consortium): see recent paper in Nature Methods, Parmbsc1: a refined force field for DNA simulations I. Ivani et al. Nature Methods aop, (2015) | doi:10.1038/nmeth.3658. Also their work in R.N. Irobalieva et al. Nature Communications 6, Article number: 8440 doi:10.1038/ncomms944055 (Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA) By regulating access to the genetic code, DNA supercoiling strongly affects DNA metabolism. Despite its importance, however, much about supercoiled DNA (positively supercoiled DNA, in particular) remains unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography together with biochemical analyses to investigate structures of individual purified DNA minicircle topoisomers with defined degrees of supercoiling. Our results reveal that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations. Moreover, we uncover striking differences in how the topoisomers handle torsional stress. As negative supercoiling increases, bases are increasingly exposed. Beyond a sharp supercoiling threshold, we also detect exposed bases in positively supercoiled DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations independently confirm the conformational heterogeneity and provide atomistic insight into the flexibility of supercoiled DNA. Our integrated approach reveals the three-dimensional structures of DNA that are essential for its function.

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
Large scale simulations of bacterial outer membranes have revealed how dynamic co-clustering of membrane proteins is mediated by protein-lipid-protein interactions. Working closely with experimentalists in Oxford and York we have shown how this helps to explain segregation of 'old' and 'new' membrane proteins during cell growth and division. This is of direct relevance to probing for possible new targets for antimicrobials. Rassam, P., Copeland, N.A., Birkholz, O., T&amp;oacute;th, C., Chavent, M., Duncan, A.L., Cross, S.J., Housden, N.G., Seger, U., Quinn, D.M., Garrod, T.J., Sansom, M.S.P. Piehler, J., Baumann, C.G., &amp;amp; Kleanthous, C. (2015) Supramolecular assemblies underpin turnover of outer membrane proteins in bacteria. Nature 523:333-336.This approach has since been extended to mammalian cell membranes, and the role of lipid in dynamic co-clustering has been explored. This is of direct relevance to understanding the mode of action of lipid-like drugs targeted at GPCRs: Kolds&amp;oslash;, H., &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P. (2015) Organization and dynamics of receptor proteins in a plasma membrane. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 137:14694-14704. 

Dr Gareth Shannon worked as a HECBioSim Postdoctoral Research Associate in Software Development for Biomolecular Simulation at the University of Nottingham. This 12-month contract spanned 05/01/2015 - 04/01/2016. Longbow is a remote molecular dynamics (MD) job submitter. It allows biomolecular simulation researchers to submit molecular dynamics jobs on remote resources such as High Performance Computers (HPCs) without leaving the familiarity of the Unix-based desktop environment. Longbow delivers and it certainly has the potential to redefine the manner in which HPCs are used. Longbow can be adapted to run any executable installed on an HPC. In this way, the number of users could reach a critical mass such that Longbow becomes a well-known tool internationally in computational science communities. 

Our case studies provide examples of industrial engagement and impact. 

Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

An example of a recent workshop is: our HECBioSim Workshop : 'Going Large: tools to simplify running and analysing large-scale MD simulations on HPC resources', Wed 16 December 2015, Daresbury Laboratory, UK. This 1 day workshop dealt with Longbow, a Python tool created by HECBioSim consortium that allows use of molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD) with ease from the comfort of the desktop, and pyPcazip, a flexible Python-based package for the analysis of large molecular dynamics trajectory data sets.

We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Examples include:

Multiscale Modelling Conference. A joint CCPBioSim/CCP5 conference on the theme of multiscale simulation was held in Manchester on 7-9th Jan 2014.

Other Joint CCP events: The collaborative computational projects for biomolecular and condensed matter simulation, CCPBioSim and CCP5, are holding a second international conference on the theme of multiscale modelling in Manchester, following on from the first held in January 2014. The three-day event will bring together leading researchers from biological and materials chemistry to discuss topics of common interest across the spectrum of electronic structure, atomistic and mesoscopic scales and to address the current and future challenges posed by multiscale modelling.

We are also organizing a joint meeting with CCPN on the interface of NMR and simulation, to be held in July 2016 (Julien Michel, Edinburgh, is leading on organization for CCP-BioSim). 
Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above).

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
ARCHER time through HECBioSIm has been used to elucidate the mode of action of cancer-causing and drug-resistance causing mutations in an important class of signalling proteins (protein kinases). This kind of information is of great importance in the rational design of more effective anti-cancer drugs.

Mario Orsi (School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London)
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed on models for cell membranes. In particular, effects due to changes in the lamellar vs. nonlamellar lipid composition of membranes were quantified. A number of properties of mixed lipid membranes were characterized quantitatively for the first time, including the lateral pressure, electric field and dipole potential. This work has been published in a high quality peer-reviewed international journal [Wei Ding, Michail Palaiokostas, Wen Wang, and Mario Orsi, Effects of Lipid Composition on Bilayer Membranes Quantified by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2015 119 (49), 15263-15274, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b06604]. Molecular simulations were conducted to study permeation processes of small molecules through mixed lipid membranes. For the first time, it is shown that nonlamellar lipids reduce membrane permeation through a mechanism that can be related to a small number of fundamental physical properties. A manuscript on this research is in preparation. The research conducted was selected for oral presentations at the 2015 MGMS Young Modellers' Forum (The Old Naval College, Greenwich, London, 27/11/15) and at the 2015 Thomas Young Centre Student Day (Imperial College, London, 17/12/15), as well as for poster presentations at the 2016 Annual Biophysical Society meeting (Los Angeles, 27 Feb-2 Mar 2016).

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
We have also used ARCHER as part of our ongoing programme of very large scale simulations of the dynamic properties of viral membrane envelopes in biomedically important enveloped viruses including influenza and dengue. (Reddy, T. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P. (2015) The role of the membrane in the structure and biophysical robustness of the dengue virion envelope. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2015.12.011). These virus simulations were featured in local media following their presentation by Tyler Reddy at the 2014 US Biophysics meeting. Other recent successes of the use of ARCHER under HECBioSim (Sansom Group, Oxford) include a collaboration between computational and experimental groups (the latter using advanced microscopy imaging of bacterial membranes) to study role of nanoscale 'islands' of membrane proteins in bacterial cell division (see above). This work is continuing, and is of relevance to developing novel targets to help overcome antimicrobial resistance. It has also led to an increase in interest in large scale simulations of membranes from a number of structural biology and biophysics groups, including those of Carol Robinson (Chemistry, Oxford) and Liz Carpenter (SGC, Oxford), in particular using these methods to characterise the interactions of membrane proteins with their lipid bilayer environment Stansfeld, P.J., Goose, J.E., Caffrey, M., Carpenter, E.P., Parker, J.L., Newstead, N. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P.

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
Researchers from University College London, led by Francesco Gervasio in collaboration with the Structural Biology Computational Group of the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) headed by Alfonso Valencia have developed the first computational method based on evolutionary principles to predict protein dynamics, which explains the changes in the shape or dimensional structure that they experience in order to interact with other compounds or speed up chemical reactions. The study made possible by the supercomputing resources provided by Archer and PRACE constitutes a major step forward in the computational study of protein dynamics.

The &amp;quot;Analysis of the allosteric communication in HIF-2a-ARNT heterodimer&amp;quot; has recently started (1st December 2015). It is aimed at the identification of the allosteric pathways in the HIF-2a-ARNT heterodimer. This can advance the discovery of therapeutic molecules and shed light on the mechanisms underlying disease mutations and post-translational modifications affecting the response to hypoxic stress in cells. In this early stages of the project, a promising collaboration has been explored with the group of Prof. Laura Bonati at the University of Milan-Bicocca.

Future Vision: How do you see the Consortium strategy evolving and changing in the future? In the next 5 years, what new science questions will members of your Consortium be seeking to address? Why are these important?

We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular them for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology.

One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.</gtr:description><gtr:id>24BBDA60-DD65-48CC-9734-FDDEFD50DB9C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Background
Single paragraph detailing what the HEC Consortium is/does.

HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), , and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, e.g., served on the HECToR Resource Allocation Panel, including the current and previous Chairs of the RAP. The Consortium welcomes new members across the whole community. Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have expressed interest in joining and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see e.g. case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Management
HECBioSim supports three different types of project allocation for time on ARCHER. Pump priming projects are those designed to assist a number of activities (e.g. testing of new codes) and typically fall in the &amp;lt;1MAU range. The standard project is probably the most common and is covered in the 1-15 MAU range. Grand challenge projects are typically projects that fall in the 15-50 MAU range, these are generally large collaborative projects that would involve collaboration on a national scale. Applications are made through the website www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of a series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects (to-date 31 projects). 

We have welcomed several new groups into HECBioSim since our inception - we are open to new members, unlike some Consortia. All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively; any groups in the UK can apply. 

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). To-date, the website has been accessed by over 10,000 unique IPs. Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Highlights for the Current Reporting Period
No more than half a page detailing significant highlights for the period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.

Here we highlight in particular as one example (others are listed in sections below), work of Charlie Laughton (Pharmacy, Nottingham) and Sarah Harris (Physics, Leeds): A new, highly accurate, force field for the simulation of DNA, developed and tested using ARCHER through HECBioSim (as part of a large international consortium): see recent paper in Nature Methods, Parmbsc1: a refined force field for DNA simulations I. Ivani et al. Nature Methods aop, (2015) | doi:10.1038/nmeth.3658. Also their work in R.N. Irobalieva et al. Nature Communications 6, Article number: 8440 doi:10.1038/ncomms944055 (Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA) By regulating access to the genetic code, DNA supercoiling strongly affects DNA metabolism. Despite its importance, however, much about supercoiled DNA (positively supercoiled DNA, in particular) remains unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography together with biochemical analyses to investigate structures of individual purified DNA minicircle topoisomers with defined degrees of supercoiling. Our results reveal that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations. Moreover, we uncover striking differences in how the topoisomers handle torsional stress. As negative supercoiling increases, bases are increasingly exposed. Beyond a sharp supercoiling threshold, we also detect exposed bases in positively supercoiled DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations independently confirm the conformational heterogeneity and provide atomistic insight into the flexibility of supercoiled DNA. Our integrated approach reveals the three-dimensional structures of DNA that are essential for its function.

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
Large scale simulations of bacterial outer membranes have revealed how dynamic co-clustering of membrane proteins is mediated by protein-lipid-protein interactions. Working closely with experimentalists in Oxford and York we have shown how this helps to explain segregation of 'old' and 'new' membrane proteins during cell growth and division. This is of direct relevance to probing for possible new targets for antimicrobials. Rassam, P., Copeland, N.A., Birkholz, O., T&amp;oacute;th, C., Chavent, M., Duncan, A.L., Cross, S.J., Housden, N.G., Seger, U., Quinn, D.M., Garrod, T.J., Sansom, M.S.P. Piehler, J., Baumann, C.G., &amp;amp; Kleanthous, C. (2015) Supramolecular assemblies underpin turnover of outer membrane proteins in bacteria. Nature 523:333-336.This approach has since been extended to mammalian cell membranes, and the role of lipid in dynamic co-clustering has been explored. This is of direct relevance to understanding the mode of action of lipid-like drugs targeted at GPCRs: Kolds&amp;oslash;, H., &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P.

Dr Gareth Shannon worked as a HECBioSim Postdoctoral Research Associate in Software Development for Biomolecular Simulation at the University of Nottingham. This 12-month contract spanned 05/01/2015 - 04/01/2016. Longbow is a remote molecular dynamics (MD) job submitter. It allows biomolecular simulation researchers to submit molecular dynamics jobs on remote resources such as High Performance Computers (HPCs) without leaving the familiarity of the Unix-based desktop environment. Longbow delivers and it certainly has the potential to redefine the manner in which HPCs are used. Longbow can be adapted to run any executable installed on an HPC. In this way, the number of users could reach a critical mass such that Longbow becomes a well-known tool internationally in computational science communities. 

Our case studies provide examples of industrial engagement and impact.

No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

An example of a recent workshop is: our HECBioSim Workshop : 'Going Large: tools to simplify running and analysing large-scale MD simulations on HPC resources', Wed 16 December 2015, Daresbury Laboratory, UK. This 1 day workshop dealt with Longbow, a Python tool created by HECBioSim consortium that allows use of molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD) with ease from the comfort of the desktop, and pyPcazip, a flexible Python-based package for the analysis of large molecular dynamics trajectory data sets.

We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Examples include:

Free Energy Calculation and Molecular Kinetics Workshop, April 20-22, 2015.

Free energy workshop, 2nd edition, Southampton, Nov 25th 2014.

How to set up a Protein Simulation, 3rd edition, Oxford, Sep 29th 2014.

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
ARCHER time through HECBioSIm has been used to elucidate the mode of action of cancer-causing and drug-resistance causing mutations in an important class of signalling proteins (protein kinases). This kind of information is of great importance in the rational design of more effective anti-cancer drugs.

Mario Orsi (School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London)
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed on models for cell membranes. In particular, effects due to changes in the lamellar vs. nonlamellar lipid composition of membranes were quantified. A number of properties of mixed lipid membranes were characterized quantitatively for the first time, including the lateral pressure, electric field and dipole potential. This work has been published in a high quality peer-reviewed international journal [Wei Ding, Michail Palaiokostas, Wen Wang, and Mario Orsi, Effects of Lipid Composition on Bilayer Membranes Quantified by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2015 119 (49), 15263-15274, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b06604]. Molecular simulations were conducted to study permeation processes of small molecules through mixed lipid membranes. For the first time, it is shown that nonlamellar lipids reduce membrane permeation through a mechanism that can be related to a small number of fundamental physical properties. A manuscript on this research is in preparation. The research conducted was selected for oral presentations at the 2015 MGMS Young Modellers' Forum (The Old Naval College, Greenwich, London, 27/11/15) and at the 2015 Thomas Young Centre Student Day (Imperial College, London, 17/12/15), as well as for poster presentations at the 2016 Annual Biophysical Society meeting (Los Angeles, 27 Feb-2 Mar 2016).

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
We have also used ARCHER as part of our ongoing programme of very large scale simulations of the dynamic properties of viral membrane envelopes in biomedically important enveloped viruses including influenza and dengue. (Reddy, T. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P. (2015) The role of the membrane in the structure and biophysical robustness of the dengue virion envelope. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2015.12.011). These virus simulations were featured in local media following their presentation by Tyler Reddy at the 2014 US Biophysics meeting. Other recent successes of the use of ARCHER under HECBioSim (Sansom Group, Oxford) include a collaboration between computational and experimental groups (the latter using advanced microscopy imaging of bacterial membranes) to study role of nanoscale 'islands' of membrane proteins in bacterial cell division (see above). This work is continuing, and is of relevance to developing novel targets to help overcome antimicrobial resistance. It has also led to an increase in interest in large scale simulations of membranes from a number of structural biology and biophysics groups, including those of Carol Robinson (Chemistry, Oxford) and Liz Carpenter (SGC, Oxford), in particular using these methods to characterise the interactions of membrane proteins with their lipid bilayer environment Stansfeld, P.J., Goose, J.E., Caffrey, M., Carpenter, E.P., Parker, J.L., Newstead, N. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P.

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
Researchers from University College London, led by Francesco Gervasio in collaboration with the Structural Biology Computational Group of the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) headed by Alfonso Valencia have developed the first computational method based on evolutionary principles to predict protein dynamics, which explains the changes in the shape or dimensional structure that they experience in order to interact with other compounds or speed up chemical reactions. The study made possible by the supercomputing resources provided by Archer and PRACE constitutes a major step forward in the computational study of protein dynamics.

Future Vision: How do you see the Consortium strategy evolving and changing in the future? In the next 5 years, what new science questions will members of your Consortium be seeking to address? Why are these important?

We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular them for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology.

One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Background
Single paragraph detailing what the HEC Consortium is/does.

HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), , and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, e.g., served on the HECToR Resource Allocation Panel, including the current and previous Chairs of the RAP. The Consortium welcomes new members across the whole community. Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have expressed interest in joining and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see e.g. case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Management
HECBioSim supports three different types of project allocation for time on ARCHER. Pump priming projects are those designed to assist a number of activities (e.g. testing of new codes) and typically fall in the &amp;lt;1MAU range. The standard project is probably the most common and is covered in the 1-15 MAU range. Grand challenge projects are typically projects that fall in the 15-50 MAU range, these are generally large collaborative projects that would involve collaboration on a national scale. Applications are made through the website www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of a series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects (to-date 31 projects). 

We have welcomed several new groups into HECBioSim since our inception - we are open to new members, unlike some Consortia. All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively; any groups in the UK can apply. 

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). To-date, the website has been accessed by over 10,000 unique IPs. Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Highlights for the Current Reporting Period
No more than half a page detailing significant highlights for the period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.

Here we highlight in particular as one example (others are listed in sections below), work of Charlie Laughton (Pharmacy, Nottingham) and Sarah Harris (Physics, Leeds): A new, highly accurate, force field for the simulation of DNA, developed and tested using ARCHER through HECBioSim (as part of a large international consortium): see recent paper in Nature Methods, Parmbsc1: a refined force field for DNA simulations I. Ivani et al. Nature Methods aop, (2015) | doi:10.1038/nmeth.3658. Also their work in R.N. Irobalieva et al. Nature Communications 6, Article number: 8440 doi:10.1038/ncomms944055 (Structural diversity of supercoiled DNA) By regulating access to the genetic code, DNA supercoiling strongly affects DNA metabolism. Despite its importance, however, much about supercoiled DNA (positively supercoiled DNA, in particular) remains unknown. Here we use electron cryo-tomography together with biochemical analyses to investigate structures of individual purified DNA minicircle topoisomers with defined degrees of supercoiling. Our results reveal that each topoisomer, negative or positive, adopts a unique and surprisingly wide distribution of three-dimensional conformations. Moreover, we uncover striking differences in how the topoisomers handle torsional stress. As negative supercoiling increases, bases are increasingly exposed. Beyond a sharp supercoiling threshold, we also detect exposed bases in positively supercoiled DNA. Molecular dynamics simulations independently confirm the conformational heterogeneity and provide atomistic insight into the flexibility of supercoiled DNA. Our integrated approach reveals the three-dimensional structures of DNA that are essential for its function.

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
Large scale simulations of bacterial outer membranes have revealed how dynamic co-clustering of membrane proteins is mediated by protein-lipid-protein interactions. Working closely with experimentalists in Oxford and York we have shown how this helps to explain segregation of 'old' and 'new' membrane proteins during cell growth and division. This is of direct relevance to probing for possible new targets for antimicrobials.

It allows biomolecular simulation researchers to submit molecular dynamics jobs on remote resources such as High Performance Computers (HPCs) without leaving the familiarity of the Unix-based desktop environment. Longbow delivers and it certainly has the potential to redefine the manner in which HPCs are used. Longbow can be adapted to run any executable installed on an HPC. In this way, the number of users could reach a critical mass such that Longbow becomes a well-known tool internationally in computational science communities. 

Our case studies provide examples of industrial engagement and impact. 

Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

An example of a recent workshop is: our HECBioSim Workshop : 'Going Large: tools to simplify running and analysing large-scale MD simulations on HPC resources', Wed 16 December 2015, Daresbury Laboratory, UK. This 1 day workshop dealt with Longbow, a Python tool created by HECBioSim consortium that allows use of molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, GROMACS, LAMMPS, NAMD) with ease from the comfort of the desktop, and pyPcazip, a flexible Python-based package for the analysis of large molecular dynamics trajectory data sets.

We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Examples include:

Free Energy Calculation and Molecular Kinetics Workshop, April 20-22, 2015.

Free energy workshop, 2nd edition, Southampton, Nov 25th 2014.

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
ARCHER time through HECBioSIm has been used to elucidate the mode of action of cancer-causing and drug-resistance causing mutations in an important class of signalling proteins (protein kinases). This kind of information is of great importance in the rational design of more effective anti-cancer drugs.

Mario Orsi (School of Engineering and Materials Science, Queen Mary University of London)
Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations were performed on models for cell membranes. In particular, effects due to changes in the lamellar vs. nonlamellar lipid composition of membranes were quantified. A number of properties of mixed lipid membranes were characterized quantitatively for the first time, including the lateral pressure, electric field and dipole potential. This work has been published in a high quality peer-reviewed international journal [Wei Ding, Michail Palaiokostas, Wen Wang, and Mario Orsi, Effects of Lipid Composition on Bilayer Membranes Quantified by All-Atom Molecular Dynamics The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2015 119 (49), 15263-15274, DOI: 10.1021/acs.jpcb.5b06604]. Molecular simulations were conducted to study permeation processes of small molecules through mixed lipid membranes. For the first time, it is shown that nonlamellar lipids reduce membrane permeation through a mechanism that can be related to a small number of fundamental physical properties. A manuscript on this research is in preparation. The research conducted was selected for oral presentations at the 2015 MGMS Young Modellers' Forum (The Old Naval College, Greenwich, London, 27/11/15) and at the 2015 Thomas Young Centre Student Day (Imperial College, London, 17/12/15), as well as for poster presentations at the 2016 Annual Biophysical Society meeting (Los Angeles, 27 Feb-2 Mar 2016).

Mark Sansom (Biochemistry, Oxford)
We have also used ARCHER as part of our ongoing programme of very large scale simulations of the dynamic properties of viral membrane envelopes in biomedically important enveloped viruses including influenza and dengue. (Reddy, T. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P. (2015) The role of the membrane in the structure and biophysical robustness of the dengue virion envelope. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2015.12.011). These virus simulations were featured in local media following their presentation by Tyler Reddy at the 2014 US Biophysics meeting. Other recent successes of the use of ARCHER under HECBioSim (Sansom Group, Oxford) include a collaboration between computational and experimental groups (the latter using advanced microscopy imaging of bacterial membranes) to study role of nanoscale 'islands' of membrane proteins in bacterial cell division (see above). This work is continuing, and is of relevance to developing novel targets to help overcome antimicrobial resistance. It has also led to an increase in interest in large scale simulations of membranes from a number of structural biology and biophysics groups, including those of Carol Robinson (Chemistry, Oxford) and Liz Carpenter (SGC, Oxford), in particular using these methods to characterise the interactions of membrane proteins with their lipid bilayer environment Stansfeld, P.J., Goose, J.E., Caffrey, M., Carpenter, E.P., Parker, J.L., Newstead, N. &amp;amp; Sansom, M.S.P.

Francesco Gervasio (Chemistry, UCL)
Researchers from University College London, led by Francesco Gervasio in collaboration with the Structural Biology Computational Group of the Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO) headed by Alfonso Valencia have developed the first computational method based on evolutionary principles to predict protein dynamics, which explains the changes in the shape or dimensional structure that they experience in order to interact with other compounds or speed up chemical reactions. The study made possible by the supercomputing resources provided by Archer and PRACE constitutes a major step forward in the computational study of protein dynamics.

Alessandro Pandini (Computer Science, Brunel University London)
The &amp;quot;Analysis of the allosteric communication in HIF-2a-ARNT heterodimer&amp;quot; has recently started (1st December 2015). It is aimed at the identification of the allosteric pathways in the HIF-2a-ARNT heterodimer. This can advance the discovery of therapeutic molecules and shed light on the mechanisms underlying disease mutations and post-translational modifications affecting the response to hypoxic stress in cells. In this early stages of the project, a promising collaboration has been explored with the group of Prof. Laura Bonati at the University of Milan-Bicocca. This collaboration will provide an avenue for scientific visits, for the training of a PhD student currently working in Prof. Bonati's group.

Future Vision: How do you see the Consortium strategy evolving and changing in the future? In the next 5 years, what new science questions will members of your Consortium be seeking to address? Why are these important?

We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular them for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology.

One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>604A556A-A4D6-4D85-8131-3758087CDEDB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>a datbase of all membrane protein structures and their interactions with lipids</gtr:description><gtr:id>8666B10C-FA2A-4AE2-A8F3-C131E7F6DAA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Considerable interest and uptake by membrane protein structural biologists in academia and industry (pharma).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>MemProtMD</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://memprotmd.bioch.ox.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We developed a novel and effective computational approach to predict cryptic binding sites on targets of pharmaceutical interest.</gtr:description><gtr:id>34CA3982-112F-4F88-A0EF-34510A19F056</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method has been described in an high-impact publication (JACS) and in a number of high-profile blogs in drug discovery.

Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:

Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

Greater scientific productivity: As well as speed increases, the optimisation of codes for the ARCHER machine will enable problems to be solved in less time using fewer compute resources.
? For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
? Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
? Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
? Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
? Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
? Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &amp;quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&amp;quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &amp;quot;above average&amp;quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
? What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
? What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &amp;quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&amp;quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.</gtr:description><gtr:id>50D444BB-5E1C-4AC9-91AC-FD22C38BC85B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>HECBioSim, the UK HEC Biomolecular Simulation Consortium, was established in March 2013, and works closely with and complements CCP-BioSim (the UK Collaborative Computational Project for Biomolecular Simulation at the Life Sciences Interface). Most of the members of the Consortium are experienced users of high end computing. Biomolecular simulations are now making significant contributions to a wide variety of problems in drug design and development, biocatalysis, bio and nano-technology, chemical biology and medicine. The UK has a strong and growing community in this field, recognized by the establishment in 2011 by the EPSRC of CCP-BioSim (ccpbiosim.ac.uk), and its renewal in 2015. There is a clear, growing and demonstrable need for HEC in this field. Members of the Consortium have, for example, served on the HECToR and ARCHER Resource Allocation Panel. The Consortium welcomes members across the whole biomolecular sciences community, and we are currently (and will remain) open to new members (unlike some consortia). Since establishing the Consortium, several new members (FLG, DH, ER) have joined the Management Group. Many of the projects awarded ARCHER time under the Consortium do not involve CCP-BioSim or HECBioSim Management Group members, demonstrating the openness of HECBioSim and its support of the biomolecular simulation community in the UK. A number of other researchers have joined and it is our expectation that other researchers will join HECBioSim in the future. We actively engage with structural and chemical biologists and industrial researchers. We foster interactions between computational, experimental and industrial scientists (see the example case studies; members of the Consortium have excellent links with many pharmaceutical, chemical and biotechnology companies). Details of HECBioSim are available via our webpages at: http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk 

Applications are made through the website http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk and reviewed at one of the series of regular panel meetings. 

A list of successful HECtime allocations on ARCHER is available at:http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/applications/successfulprojects

All proposals are of course subject to scientific and technical review, but we have the philosophy of supporting the best science to deliver the highest impact, rather than focusing on supporting development of a couple of codes. An allocation panel (with changing membership) meets twice yearly to judge proposals and requests for AUs; projects are assessed competitively: any groups in the UK can apply. All submitted proposals receive constructive feedback from the allocation panel.

The HECBioSim website also provides forums for the biomolecular simulation community, a wiki hosting useful how-tos and user guides, and software downloads (currently FESetup and Longbow). Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource, such as ARCHER, in a manner invisible to the user. 
Workshops and New Opportunities
No more than half a page detailing upcoming workshops and meetings. Also include discussion of other areas which are potentially of interest to other HEC Consortia and opportunities for cross CCP /HEC working.

Workshops are listed below and can be found on the HECBioSim Website
We work closely with CCP-BioSim, for example in organizing training workshops and meetings. Our activities are outlined at www.hecbiosim.ac.uk Examples of forthcoming meetings include:

Issues and Problems
Short discussion of any issues or problems that the HEC Consortium faces including issues with the ARCHER service, funding, management of allocation and staffing. This is also a good opportunity to highlight to the SLA committee any issues that the Consortium may have experienced with their SLA support during the reporting period.

Details of SLA activities are given in the SLA report. Dr. James Gebbie provides support to HECBioSIm through the SLA. He has been very helpful in the construction of the HECBioSim webpages (hecbiosim.ac.uk). James also worked with Dr. Gareth Shannon on the development of Longbow (See above). 
In the past year, members of the Consortium faced some queuing problems; close to the end of the first allocation period in particular, there were long queuing times, which led to problems in completing jobs and using allocated time. Throughput has been a real problem in the past few months.

? For the reporting period please provide a brief update on the progress of software development activities associated with the Consortium and the impact this has had on Consortium members and the broader research community.

Our lead software development project between Nottingham (Charlie Laughton and Gareth Shannon) and Daresbury (James Gebbie), we have developed a remote job submission tool, 'Longbow' (see below). The tool is designed to reproduce the look and feel of local MD packages, but to stage data and submit jobs to a large HPC resource such as ARCHER in a manner invisible to the user. An open beta version was released unrestricted to the community in March 2015 (http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow and via PyPI https://pypi.python.org ) with ~100 downloads. Functionality includes native support for biosimulation packages AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD, native support for jobs on ARCHER, native support for jobs running on PBS and LSF schedulers, and support for three different job types (single, ensembles and multiple jobs). The software is written both as an application for users and an API for developers. CCP-EM have integrated Longbow into their developmental GUI, and shortly FESetup will ship with native support for job submission using Longbow. We are currently in talks with ClusterVision with respect to them distributing Longbow to their user base as a user friendly way for novices to interact with their systems.

Longbow
Longbow has been growing in popularity both amongst researchers within the biosimulation field and those in other fields. In this reporting period there have been five new releases of Longbow delivering a plethora of user requested features and bug fixes. Some of the key developments are summarised below:
? Implemented a Recovery mode - Should the event happen that Longbow crashes or the system in which Longbow is controlling jobs from powers down. The user can now reconnect to the crashed session and carry on as if nothing happened.
? Sub-Queuing - More and more system administrators are setting limits not just on the number of simulations that can run, but also on the number of jobs that can go into the queue. Longbow can now automatically detect this and implement its own queue feeding jobs into the system queue as slots open up.
? Dis-connectible/Re-connectible Longbow sessions - A user can now launch Longbow to fire off all jobs and then disconnect, at a later date the user can re-establish the connection and download all results (no need for persistent connections anymore) 
? Ability to include scripts in the Longbow generated submit files.
? Numerous stability, performance and bug fixes
Longbow continues to be the submission engine that is used under the hood of the CCP-EM toolkit FLEX-EM. There are several other interesting projects that are making use of Longbow. 
A project by the energy efficient computing group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating Longbow with CK, a crowd sourced compilation optimisation tool aimed at finding efficient compilation configuration. 
A project by the Applications performance engineering group (Hartree Center) are currently integrating longbow into Melody, a runtime optimisation tool aimed at optimising runtime configuration of simulations.
A project by the computational biology group (Hartree Center) an automated setup, launch and analysis platform for MD on protein-membrane simulations.

The work performed with Sam resulted in an successful eCSE application for development work on the LAMMPS software. This is an international simulation package run out of Sandia labs in the US. Through this eCSE application we were able to update the rotational integrator and improve the load balancing for our hybrid simulation methodology. These developments have been incorporated in the latest release versions of the code. An ARCHER training webinar resulted from this work.

Other Highlights for the Current Reporting Period: Please provide details of any other significant highlights from the reporting period that are not captured elsewhere in the report.


Professor Adrian Mullholland organised and chaired the Computational Chemistry, Gordon Research Conference, Girona, Spain 24th - 29th July 2016.

The theme of the 2016 Computational Chemistry GRC was &amp;quot;Theory and Simulation Across Scales in Molecular Science&amp;quot;. It focused on method development and state-of-the-art applications across computational molecular science, and encouraged cross-fertilization between areas. The conference was oversubscribed, with attendees from industry and academia. The meeting received a High-Performance Rating, and was commended for the assessment that 95% of conferees rated this meeting &amp;quot;above average&amp;quot; on all evaluation areas (science, discussion, management, atmosphere and suitability).


HEC Consortia Model: Over the coming months EPSRC will be looking at the future of the HEC Consortia model and potential future funding. We would like to use this opportunity to ask the Consortia Chairs for input:
? What are the key benefits that your community have experienced through the existence of the HEC Consortia? 
? What elements of the financial support provided by the HEC Consortium's grant have worked well and what could be improved in the future? 


We aim to expand the breadth of the work of the Consortium focusing on cutting-edge applications, and building collaborations with experiments and industry, to achieve maximum impact from ARCHER use. We discussed Grand Challenges at our most recent Management Group meeting. In December 2015, and have identified several to follow up as strategic priorities. We aim to tackle and support large-scale grand challenge applications in biomolecular science, in areas such as antimicrobial resistance, membrane dynamics, drug design and synthetic biology. One specific theme with potentially high impact in drug discovery is large -scale comparative investigation of allosteric regulation in different superfamilies of proteins (e.g. PAS domain containing proteins, tyrosine kinases, etc.). The major impact will be in the identification of novel selective therapeutic molecules with limited adverse side effects. As a Consortium, we intend to develop and apply novel computational approaches for the rational design of allosteric regulators of hitherto 'undruggable' targets. Many of the targets emerging from large-scale genetic screening are deemed undruggable due to the difficulty of designing drug-like modulators that bind to their catalytic sites. It is increasingly clear that these targets might be effectively targeted by designing drugs that bind to protein-protein interfaces and allosteric sites. To do that, however, new rational design strategies, based on an in-depth knowledge of protein dynamics and advanced modelling and new simulation techniques are required. Other challenging frontier areas include dynamics of motor proteins; prediction of the effects of pathogenic mutations on protein function. The accurate prediction of free energy of binding is still in its infancy and needs much further investigation. Finally, kinetics of biomolecular reactions will become the next big topic. It is clear that high end computing resource can provide the necessary power and capability to provide inroads into this vital area. This is important because it is becoming increasingly apparent that kinetics of drug binding is a key factor that the pharmaceutical sector should really be looking at in terms of a major dictator of potency.

HECBioSim is now well established, supporting work of many groups across the UK in the growing field of biomolecular simulation. We benefit from an Advisory Group containing members from industry, as we as international biomolecular simulation experts and experimental scientists. The Advisory Board was expanded and refreshed for the renewal and consists of: Dr. Nicolas Foloppe (Vernalis plc, Chair); Dr. Colin Edge (GlaxoSmithKline); Dr. Mike King (UCB Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Mike Mazanetz (Evotec AG); Dr. Garrett Morris (Crysalin Ltd.); Dr. Gary Tresadern (Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceuticals); Dr. Richard Ward (AstraZeneca); Prof. Modesto Orozco (IRB, Barcelona); Prof. Tony Watts, (Oxford, NMR); Dr. Pete Bond (A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute Singapore). We aim to foster industrial collaborations and collaborations with experimentalists (e.g. joint workshops with CCPN, Institute of Physics (Sarah Harris, Leeds Physics); see e.g. case studies. A particular theme for strategic development will be multiscale modelling, building on collaborations between several groups in the Consortium and the other CCPs. This theme reflects the inclusive and forward looking philosophy of HecBioSim, which is a community open to new ideas, keen to develop new methods, and ultimately to use HEC to drive exciting new science.

The Consortium model allows new collaborations to develop. The recent reduction in time allocated to HECBioSim has meant that we can support fewer projects. There is significantly more demand for computer time than we can accommodate through our current allocation. We intend to work with Tier 2 Centres to explore possibilities for applications, and e.g. to test emerging architectures for biomolecular simulation. 

Edina Rosta (Computational Chemistry, Kings College London) comments: &amp;quot;HECBioSim enables my group to perform biomolecular simulations at the high standards required for JACS, Angewandte, etc. Without this consortium I would not be able to perform the necessary calculations leading to publishable work in top journals as our local university resources are limited and the hpc systems are not well maintained&amp;quot;.

Regarding financial support: the administrative support provided via the consortium grant is essential to the functioning of HECBioSim. This role is currently undertaken by Simone Breckell who not only administers, allocates time to projects and arranges panel meetings but has also done a fantastic job collating the extensive information for this EPSRC report.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Annual report to EPSRC; details below</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Longbow is a software tool that makes it easier for non-specialist researchers to use HPC facilities such as ARCHER for biomolecular simulation</gtr:description><gtr:id>B495CDC0-91E7-4EFF-B6EE-DFF01A2CAA5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Longbow is now used routinely in our own research group, and is being adapted by other Collaborative Computational Projects (e.g., CCPEM) who have a similar requirement to make it easier for their community to use HPC resources.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Longbow</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow-docs</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Longbow is a piece of software that acts as a job proxying tool for biomolecular simulations, Longbow reproduces the native look and feel of using popular molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD), with the difference that when those packages are used through Longbow simulations can be run on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources such as ARCHER. Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a specified time interval.

This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it supports.

Changes:

1. longbow commands now have a well defined format of: longbow [longbow arguments] executable [executableargs].
2. The parameter hierarchy has changed such that now parameters provided on the Longbow command line will overrule the same parameters in configuration files.
3. The -stage longbow argument is no longer supported as Longbow will automatically detect additional input files.
4. The rsync --include and --exclude have been exposed so that users can mask out files they do not need. These are separated into upload and downloads by using the following parameters; upload-include, upload-exclude, download-include and download-exclude. Only the download variants are available to the user (upload variants are used internally within Longbow but developers can make use of them in the API).
5. For replicate jobs, the order in which Longbow will search for input files has changed such that it looks in the repX subdirectories before the current working directory.
6. The batch parameter has been renamed replicates.
7. The commandline parameter has been renamed executableargs.
8. The parameters replicates (formerly batch) and jobname can now be provided on the Longbow command line as longbow arguments. 9. jobname is an exception as it is the only parameter that cannot overrule the jobname provided in the job configuration file.
10. LongbowExamples is now downloaded to the current working directory rather than the home directory when downloaded using longbow -examples.
Jobs now run on the remote resource in /remoteworkdir/jobnameXXXXX where XXXXX represents a random 5-digit number. This is to prevent jobs with the same jobname clashing on the remote resource.
Bugs have been fixed such that jobs will run on remote resources that use the SGE_ARC2 scheduler.
Four Gromacs executables are now supported: mdrun, mdrun_d, mdrun_mpi, mdrun_mpi_d
The hosts configuration file and LongbowExamples will now be downloaded using curl for those who do not have wget.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3C2D8C55-4FA5-48D1-A962-7BAE633E7636</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index.

Longbow has also been or is currently being incorporated into software pipelines of other groups/consortia, projects of notable progress include integrating with FLEX-EM a powerful tool developed by CCP-EM and FESetup developed by CCPBioSim.

Changes:

1. Modifications to how Longbow accepts the help and version command line parameters, some people don't follow GNU standards and thus so that we can show them the help message/version we have allowed -v, -version, --version, -h, -help and --help
2. Longbow now creates missing repX directories if they are missing in cases where all input files are global. This would allow jobs that might use different random seeds on the same input files to be efficient on transfers.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C64DBA0-824E-4470-925B-B072A2678992</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index.

Changes:

Fix for issue #117 - Python 3 and pip bug: 

1. Longbow would not install under python 3 using either pip or by running the setup script manually. This has now been fixed by using print statements of the format print(&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;), this form will work in all versions of python.

Fix for issue #116 - User reported annoyances: 

1. Fix for user reported annoyance of installing the hosts.conf in secret, and also leaving the archive that is downloaded in $home. This has now been replaced with a warning during install, and also the file is created locally and not downloaded.
2. Removed padding from version numbers so v1.01.005 &amp;gt; v1.1.5
3. Changed the README.md from markdown format to reStructured text, so now the README is README.rst, this is to make Longbow more pip friendly whilst still being bitbucket and possibly github (in case in future we move).
4. setup.py modified to eliminate the python 3 issues, and also the long description is now the README.rst, this means that users will see something standard between the pip page and the bitbucket page, this will also tie in with new pages on the HECBioSim website which will push pip as the preferred way to install more prominently.
5. hosts.conf file has been removed from the development version since this is now created on install for new users using pip, this will be marked as deprecated on the website for a while so users on old versions can still get it. Documentation will need to be updated to reflect this change and provide the quickstart example that users can grab a copy of if they are doing a more manual install. However pip will be the encouraged way to install.

Issue #115 - Parameters in input files:
Parameters specified within the configuration files had to be specified in a very strict format (param = value), users that omitted the spaces would find that Longbow would crash. The code has now been fixed to use regular expression to read in and parse for the equals sign, this can now handle cases where users specify cases such as:
 param1 = value1
 param2 =value2
 param3= value3
 param4=value4

1. Fix for issue #114 - The saveconfigs method would overwrite entries within the hosts config with potentially blank entries if it was triggered and parameters existed in such a state (perhaps via overrides).
2. Fix for issue #113 - There was a missing clause on one of the if statements that prevented parameters at the hosts level from overriding internal defaults.

Built into this portal are facilities for members of the community to contribute their own software, documentation or guides so that the wider community can benefit from shared knowledge, this is a feature we hope to focus on in the near future. The portal itself has been constructed with different usage patterns and devices in mind, and to date works across all known smart phone, tablet and desktop type devices along with being cosmetically compatible with the 5 browsers at the top of the market share.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F58FFAF3-CBB9-4AEE-A215-68DC676CD6BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The HECBioSim portal has been heavily utilised by a very broad spectrum of users. Since the website was installed in 2014 we have had just over 213,000 hits by 67,869 unique IP addresses. Users are making heavy use of the ARCHER application form, guidance material and the kAU calculator tool, suggesting that users are finding these tools helpful over the old word document by email application process. Other sections of the website seeing heavy use are the software download and the documentation repositories.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>HECBioSim Web Portal</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Longbow is a piece of software that acts as a job proxying tool for biomolecular simulations, Longbow reproduces the native look and feel of using popular molecular dynamics packages (AMBER, CHARMM, GROMACS, LAMMPS and NAMD), with the difference that when those packages are used through Longbow simulations can be run on High Performance Computing (HPC) resources such as ARCHER. Longbow handles jobs setup in terms of creating job submission scripts, automatically stages input files, launches and monitors jobs and stages back simulation results. The option is also there to persistently monitor and stage (realtime local syncing with remote simulation files) simulation files at a specified time interval.

This is designed to have the jobs running on the HPC remote resource appear to the user as if the simulation has run on their local computer/cluster. Users do not have to concern themselves with writing submission files, nor do they have to worry about staging. Longbow provides a convenient interface for generating large ensembles of simulation jobs which in effect extends the packages it supports.

Changes:

1. Update to the supported command line arguments to support non and GNU standard options for help and version number.
2. Update to allow the creation of repX directories when they are missing (Stops gromacs etc from exiting with path not found error)
3. Fix for bugs in python 3, there were two issues, one a python name change and the second was due to garbled output coming from the linux shell environment.</gtr:description><gtr:id>49F1E480-C265-466D-80EF-7EF17C84A647</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Since the release of the first version of Longbow, there have been just over 400 verified unique downloads between the HECBioSim download repository and the Python PyPi index. The active user-base includes users from both academic (21 different institutions in the UK) and the industrial sector globally.

Longbow has also been or is currently being incorporated into software pipelines of other groups/consortia, projects of notable progress include integrating with FLEX-EM a powerful tool developed by CCP-EM and FESetup developed by CCPBioSim. The Longbow project led to a collaboration with pharmaceutical company UCB into integration of Longbow into their workflow, this also led to a feasibility study into the construction of a similar tool for commercial cloud services such as Amazon EC2 or Microsoft Azure.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Longbow v1.1.3</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.hecbiosim.ac.uk/longbow</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The HECBioSim kAU calculator is a user friendly web application that provides a simple interface to the complex predictive scaling model derived from our benchmark studies of commonly used molecular dynamics codes on ARCHER.
