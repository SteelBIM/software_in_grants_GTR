Studies have shown that when they are mentioned, children are positioned as vulnerable and consequently, problematic for emergency planners, rather than seen as a resource (Emergency Planning College &amp;amp; Save the Children 2014). Understanding children's perspectives is a vital part of the process of building disaster resilience: children are future citizens and community members in their own right. Most studies of hazards have failed to recognise the role of children and young people as social actors and the need to develop participatory methodologies that can empower children both to articulate their experiences and shape responses from relevant agencies and adults. This neglect is particularly problematic given the increasing policy emphasis on building individual and community resilience as a strategy for coping and responding to hazards, and on policy shifts recognising children's right to a voice in decisions which affect their lives, e.g. United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Article 12. In-depth qualitative social scientific approaches that facilitate the sharing and exploration of experience and meaning of events in children's lives are needed to fulfil these commitments in this context. 

The acute storms and floods of winter 2013/4 revealed a problem which, against the background of the 2007 floods where thousands of homes were made uninhabitable, is now understood to be chronic, with 5.2 million properties now at risk of flooding in England alone. There is urgent need a) to document children and young people's perspectives on their experience of flooding in appropriate ways before the next flood season and before their memories recede; b) to develop appropriate responses which build on this enhanced understanding and c) integrate a &amp;amp; b with policy, working with all levels of government and civil society to improve practice in both response and preparedness domains.

Some of the complexities experienced by flood-affected children such as enduring long-term effects of living in temporary accommodation, re-locating to a different school, family tensions at home exacerbated by flood-related financial worries and the fear of recurring disaster are beginning to be known. In many cases such disruption to home, school and friendship networks impact on children's longer-term physical and emotional health. Living with these changes and uncertainties was particularly problematic for groups of children in the 2007 Hull floods who felt that they had no one to turn to for help (Medd et al 2014). This project aims:

1. To understand children's experiences of the flood, their resilience and longer-term recovery process. 
2. To illuminate the relationship between children's multi-sensory experience of flooding, the recovery strategies they develop, and the longer-term effect of flood disaster on their interactions within home and school, the impact on their educational life chances and health and well-being
3. To understand how children can best be supported in a flood, what their unique needs might be and how to enhance their resilience to future emergencies.

We propose action oriented research in two contrasting flood-affected communities with school age children and young people: i) Thames Valley where in January/February 2014 thousands of households were evacuated ii) Humberside where in December 2013 a third of the children at South Ferriby school had to leave their homes. We will produce a collaborative report to a) inform the local flood affected communities b) shape ongoing and future research and c) influence policy and practice across government and third sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project is at three levels: local - in the geographical area of the project's empirical work; national/international - for third sector policy and practice development; and government - local authorities and national and international policymakers.

Our pathways to impact rest substantially on the partnership we have recently built with the major charity Save the Children (StC). While this project would represent the first practical joint working opportunity, the Co-Investigator Marion Walker has previously undertaken psychosocial recovery training with StC, specifically in relation to its Journey of Hope, an intervention developed after Hurricane Katrina working with children and their carers in the United States. StC became aware of our work on disasters and recovery and approached members of the team to explore further research opportunities. For the academics and practitioners in the collaboration this partnership represents a chance to create a project of high societal impact.

Working with children in disaster recovery and resilience requires, we believe, an interdisciplinary approach and the research team (Mort, Bingley, Walker, Howells &amp;amp; Smith) together with the steering group (Toole, Easthope, Lamb &amp;amp; Deeming) combines sociology, social and cultural geography, psychotherapy, psychology, child and adolescent mental health, disaster studies, education, emergency management &amp;amp; planning. This group of individuals brings together strong theoretical and applied knowledge, all of which will be aimed at maximising the impact of this project. 

The steering group includes Dr Steven Toole, Head of Policy at the charity 4Children (see Partners); Ian Lamb is Hull City Council Priority Families Education Coordinator and a member of the Mental Health Programme Management Group on a programme supporting 10-14 year olds (and their families and schools) looking at the well-being of students. Dr Lucy Easthope has a background in disaster relief and emergency planning and is currently working with Essex County Council on flooding and children's preparedness. Dr Hugh Deeming was a researcher on the original ESRC Celebrating Impact 2013 award winning Hull Floods Project, and is now the scientific officer for the EU FP7 emBRACE project on understanding disaster resilience.

Beneficiaries include participants directly involved i.e. children/schools in the flood-affected areas; NGOs/third sector organisations i.e. Save the Children, 4Children, British Red Cross; policy actors i.e. local and national government agencies, local authorities, local resilience and community flood forums. They will benefit from the acquisition of knowledge derived from unique empirical investigations in one of the most neglected areas of disaster policy - how children experience and respond to such events. 

In particular, Save the Children is currently developing and piloting a UK Emergencies programme; this research will be used to inform the development of the programme, ensuring that it is based on evidence and the needs, priorities and experiences of children. The findings from this research will be used to guide Save the Children's direct work with children but also inform the advocacy work it undertakes in order to influence change for children. Save the Children aims to influence government and practitioners through membership of national civil protection forums and a national working group dedicated to children in emergencies. Save the Children works in partnership with the Cabinet Office Emergency Planning College and will be co-authoring guidance on meeting the needs of children in emergencies, along with hosting a seminar on a human rights approach to emergency management, this research will feed into and inform these activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>181431</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We recently conducted work with children and parents in Cumbria (Stramongate School, Kendal) affected by the flooding caused by Storm Desmond in December 2015.

At the end of the workshops, the group was given its own 'Flood Suitcase' to keep in school, which the children had co-designed. This suitcase is a place to store photographs and other items that evoke memories of the flood and the recovery process, and could ultimately provide a focus for discussing flooding in school and opening a dialogue about community flood awareness and resilience building.

Talks are now underway between ourselves, the Fire and Rescue Service, Environment Agency and the Met Office about using The Flood Suitcase more widely in a school based education initiative.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Flood Suitcase</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/cyp-floodrecovery/news/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Save the Children</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Save the Children</gtr:description><gtr:id>870EB930-126E-41C2-9C99-23F656BCBAC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Children's and Young People's Flood Manifestos; The Flood Project film; Top Tips for Insurers Supporting Children and Families; evidence to Parliamentary committees on flooding; evidence to government policy reviews.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Working with Save the Children has strengthened our ability to engage with children and young people via schools and other organisations. it has enhanced our credibility and capacity to engage in further research, notably with EU Horizon 2020 where we now have a new large project in collaboration with Save the Children UK and Save the Children Italy (along with academic partners in Greece, Spain and Portugal)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have raised awareness within Save the Children to qualitative arts and theatre based research approaches into the effects of floods and disasters more generally with children.

Learning in school about flood warnings, how to make a flood plan and flood risk was identified by the children as a key priority in helping to build resilience.
o Children's experiences of recovery - Recovering from flooding is known to take months and sometimes years. For children this disruption has often unseen impacts on their day-to-day lives as they endure a period of living with uncertainty long after the flood event. Being in temporary accommodation is particularly difficult; a situation worsened by lack of space and for some children the upheaval of having to relocate several times before returning home. Insurance companies could improve their practices by developing more effective assessment and consistent approaches to repair, recovery and resilience which acknowledge the needs of children. 
o Children's perspectives on loss and resulting isolation - Loss of possessions as a result of flooding has a tangible impact: children demonstrated a clear understanding of the impact of losing personal 'precious' items that embody memories. However, other losses felt keenly by the children are those of friendship and social networks. Schools and communities could usefully acknowledge the range of losses experienced by children and ensure they receive appropriate social and emotional support during the lengthy recovery period. Feeling isolated, with no-one to share the long-term, ongoing impact of the floods is especially difficult for children, who can feel that their experience is not acknowledged or noticed. Flood-affected children reported a positive benefit in getting together with others to share experiences and then to present these to the wider world.
o Children as active contributors to flood risk management, flood adaptation and new normalities - Children's strengths and vulnerabilities have been poorly understood by policymakers and practitioners. Children should be given more information before, during and after flooding because they have the right to know how to prepare, what to expect and how they can contribute. Where children play an active part in helping their communities during and after a flood, their experience is beneficial. Such efforts need to be understood so that children can be seen as active citizens and not passive victims. Flood-affected children have experience and understand the measures that should be taken to prepare, protect and adapt to flooding. A clear message that emerged was the recognition that all households need to make a flood plan and crucially, flood-affected children understand the need for adaptation and the need to promote a 'new normal'. 
In order to act on these findings, a fundamental shift is required in the way policy is conceived, so that flooding becomes an issue central to health, housing, education, communities and local government, in addition to emergency planning and flood risk management .</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are now being acted on by: Environment Agency (to improve the content of its flood warnings); British Damage Management Association (in its training provision for insurers, loss adjusters, renovators etc); Insurers (e.g. Aviva in its customer communications with families); Public Health England (in its assessment of children's needs and its public facing guidance for flood recovery); Fire and Rescue Service (with EA to develop and implement a water safety education programme for schools); Emergency planners e.g. Surrey Prepared and Cumbria Flood Action Plan for their inclusion of children in flood resilience building; NGOs e.g. Save the Children, Barnardo's in adopting our methodology for working with flood affected children, in particular through the spin-off initiative 'The Flood Suitcase'.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AD6552E9-4FB5-4A2B-B77D-F3E1C3618D4C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/floodrecovery</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence the policy and practice of county emergency planners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5CF531BB-B864-4194-A298-16A559C80888</gtr:id><gtr:impact>From Sylvia Carter, Community Partnership and Committee Officer (Surrey CC) 'We were advised of your planned research involving the local secondary The Magna Carta School (in Runnymede borough) soon after the episode of flooding in the Thames Valley in 2014. Representatives from local agencies attended the initial launch of the Flood Manifesto held at the school in autumn 2014 and made pledges as invited by the students. We also attended the final launch of the research report in London in September 2016. 
The Surrey Prepared partnership (facilitated by Surrey County Council's community partnerships team which led on flood recovery and response) organised its first conference on community resilience in September 2016. Impressed by the work undertaken at Magna Carta School, their assistant head and two students were invited to present to the conference audience of approximately 100 residents (from parish councils, flood forums and resident associations) and professionals from across the county. Their presentation on emotional resilience and their experience of floods, together with screening of the film clip which the researchers produced, was very well received and several delegates commented that it had opened their eyes to the importance of engaging young people in their communities when planning for emergencies. 
Our community resilience officer Liz Fowler had already taken on board the report's findings about educating young people to prepare for emergencies, in updating the Surrey Prepared webpages to include a section on young people www.surreycc.gov.uk/surreyprepared and arranged for an article to appear in the Schools Bulletin - December 2016 (sent to all schools in Surrey) highlighting these resources.
