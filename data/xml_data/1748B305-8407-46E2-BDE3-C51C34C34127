One important example is the field of Atto-second Science where laser light and the electrons of matter interact on the atto-second time-scale making possible, for example, the shortest-ever pulses of VUV light. One atto-second is only one millionth-millionth-millionth of a second but electrons driven by strong laser light collide violently with others and move distances large compared to the size of an atom on the atto-second time-scale of several hundred atto-seconds. Another important example is the recent appreciation that ionizing radiation damages living animals and plants by bringing about strand breaks in the DNA molecule through a multi-electron interaction.Such newly emerging areas of Science involve large experimental teams in the UK and around the world who publish their research findings in top journals such as Nature and Science. Despite this, there does not yet exist anywhere in the world a set of computer codes capable of calculations of sufficient sophistication to be useful in conjunction with the laboratory experiment effort, in driving the Science forward. Such calculations demand the full power of present (and prospective) High Performance Computing - available through machines which presently can cost 100M and upwards.The purpose of the proposed research is to develop a suite of high-quality computer codes that will be widely used; will harness such high performance computing machines most effectively over many years; and will relate directly to areas of Science (brief descriptions of two such areas given above) where a detailed account of multi-electron dynamics in electrons and molecules is essential to driving the Science forward.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>130200</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen's University of Belfast</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>ARCHER eCSE contract: eCSE02-6.

The PFARM Xeon-Phi port demonstrates proper efficient use of heterogeneous platforms, with host and phi working simultaneously on the same problem. A factor of 2 performance gain has been made so far with respect to running purely on the host network. Added February 2017: PFARM is now part of the PRACE Accelerator Benchmark Suite (a PRACE 4IP project) and a new publication detailing the benchmarks has been added. PFARM has been adapted for GPU platforms. PRACE white papers describing GPU and Xeon-Phi adaptations respectively are expected in 2017-2018.

Professor Hugo van der Hart (QUB, grant EP/G055416/1), is the lead PI for the overall grant. Professor Jonathan Tennyson is local PI for grant EP/G055556/1 (UCL). The DL section provided general computational development and best practice support across all four sites particularly for repository develepment of 'UKRMol'. DL worked specifically to incorporate the atomic code 'PFARM' into the UKRMol molecular package (OU/UCL), allowing scientific outputs and papers. It also introduced further parallelization into UKRMol and QUB code RMT by obtaining related funding for relevant activities (via Daresbury's core support SLA for CCPQ, HECToR dCSE funding, ARCHER eCSE funding and through two short-term PRACE development projects) .
Main UCL outputs: a working UKRMol site and code: the paper describing this (Carr et al 2012) has, as of February 2016, had 43 citations. The PFARM adaptation to UKRMol has been used for electron-molecule calculations of resonances in RNA bases and electron methane collisions so far. The DL PRACE 3IP extra funding parallelized a resonance-finding module of UKRmol called TIMEDEL which was developed serially at UCL. A PRACE white paper has been published. Further development has greatly extended the parallelism, with much wider applications, and a joint paper on the serial and parallel TIMEDEL module is due to be submitted/published in 2016 (joint UCL-DL) . Note added February 2017: the TIMEDEL paper has been published in Computer Physics Communications (see publications list): this paper is a legacy of UK-RAMP and also due to continuing core support for CCPQ from the SLA.
Added February 2017: As a direct successor of the UK-RAMP grant a new CCP Software Flagship Grant EP/P022146/1 (2017-2019) has been awarded to QUB (van der Hart) with OU (Gorfinkiel) as co-investigator.

This development builds on the unification of the atomic and molecular packages and will develop code for time-dependent laser pulse interactions with molecular electrons and arbitrary polarization of the pulse for atomic electrons. CCPQ SLA core support will assist this project. Further outputs from UK-RAMP in these areas will be associated with the new grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The new network is organized along similar lines to its predecessor CCPQ network (EP/J010561).

This CCPQ network is a renewal of network EP/J010561 and the general description of that partnership applies here. The current network grant is from August 2015 to 2020. M Plummer (with A G Sunderland) continues to provide support for the atomic and molecular R-matrix packages and for antimatter work: other members of SCD provide support to the other aspects of CCPQ work. 
As noted in outputs below, the parallel molecular resonance code TIMEDEL has been published in Computer Physics Communications. Much optimization work has been performed on UKRMol+, the molecular inner region codes (a project to extend the UKRMol inner region basis sets to incorporate B-splines and use a more explicitly object-oriented approach to allow much more complexity in the target molecule descriptions). MP is continuing development work on a general inner region double-continuum atomic R-matrix code.
The RMT code has been added to CCPForge. Various other publications and optimization support activities by SCD members at Daresbury and RAL (not directly related to the UK-RAMP award, eg in antimatter or strongly correlated systems) have taken place.
The CCPQ website has been thoroughly revamped and relaunched.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>32000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>3.5 months FTE from the STFC-SCD allocation of PRACE 3IP development effort to parallelise the UKRMol TIMEDEL module.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A036B328-1654-4326-9061-213D8FC42B28</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>85000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>HECToR NAG dCSE contract for code improvement: Combined-Multicore Parallelism for the UK electron-atom scattering Inner Region R-matrix codes on HECToR</gtr:description><gtr:end>2012-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Numerical Algorithms Group Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>98AA51E3-E3CB-44F5-A2E8-1DB1CC88E59D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This update is February 2016 (see below for 2017). Further updates will be made in the future. We note that the DL part of UK-RAMP was based on computational and best-practice developments, with science applications being discussed in the QUB/OU/UCL key findings and narrative impact. A particular non-academic impact is the use of UKRmol by the company Quantemol which provides companies with software to perform simulations relevant to industrial plasmas. The UKRmol software allows detailed ab initio data to be calculated as part of the various simulation packages offered by the company. Resonance-finding codes (such as TIMEDEL) have been used to provide resonance data which may be linked to (eg) strand-breaking in DNA. 
As of 2014 (the date recorded in the 'date' section of narrative impact):
The CCPForge repository is very successful and its prinicples have been used and adapted by other, separate, projects in the overall atomic and molecular physics area, in particular the Tensor Network Theory (TNT) project which treats very strongly correlated many-body interactions. The PFARM interface to UKRMol is complete and has already resulted in scientifc studies and publications (science outputs of UK-RAMP are described in more detail in the QUB/UCL/OU key findings, as DL concentrated on computational matters). The diverse atomic and molecular R-Matric codes (PRMAT/PFARM, UKRMol, RMT) are in use on HPC platforms (with some modules already adapted for 'GPU' and 'Xeon-Phi' new technology), a further post-UK-RAMP code optimization 'eCSE' project underway for RMT (for use on the highest level 'Tier 0' platforms) and the communities developing them are working together.
As of February 2016:
The impact described above has continued. Work at DL, supported by EPSRC's Service Level Agreement for core support for the Collaborative Computational Projects, in this case CCPQ, has continued with further on-going ambitious code development and support for university-based code development in both the atomic and molecular areas of UK-RAMP. This work has also helped to maintain the contact and cross-fertilization between the communities. One immediate technical impact in this period is that one of the UK-RAMP codes has been 'properly' adapted for running on novel technology platform 'Xeon-Phi cluster' making full use of the properties of this heterogeneous ('host plus co-processor') system.
Added February 2017: We note that PFARM is now part of the PRACE Accelerator Benchmark Suite for general performance benchmarking of HPC systems. A parallel version of the UKRmol-out code TIMEDEL has been published in Computer Physics Communications. The UKRMol-in code is being / has been rewritten (by UK-RAMP's OU branch and collaborators), as UKRmol+, in fully object-oriented Fortran 2003 with some CCPQ core support from Daresbury, and will be used by (eg) Quantemol.

The other three grants (QUB, UCL, OU) are listed as partners. Professor Hugo van der Hart (QUB) is overall PI. The scientific code developed by UK-RAMP at QUB, UCL and OU treats the interactions of atoms and molecules with collding electrons and with light (laser pulses on both the femtosecond and attosecond scales) in full detail, solving the full Schrodinger equation for many-electron systems using the 'R-matrix' method. The scientific applications range from astrophysics and atmospheric physics and chemistry to industrial plasmas (lighting, molecular resonance processes affecting engines engines) and biological processes including the detailed mechanisms occurring in radiation damage to DNA/RNA. In attosecond science laser light and the electrons of matter interact on the atto-second time-scale making possible, for example, the shortest-ever pulses of VUV light. One atto-second is only one millionth-millionth-millionth of a second but electrons driven by strong laser light collide violently with others and move distances large compared to the size of an atom on the atto-second time-scale of several hundred atto-seconds.
The UK-RAMP project has, at QUB developed from scratch a new 'R-matrix'-based code, RMT, that can treat laser atom interactions by solving the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. At UCL/OU, the molecular R-Matrix package UKRMol has been completely upgraded (and is currently in the process of being extended to even more ambitious applications as a result of this upgrade) and formed into a sustainable repository-based modern code on the UK academic sourceforge system CCPForge, along with much new coding (described in the OU/UCL key findings) and interface development to the appropriate part of the RMT code to allow future treatment molecules in laser pulses.
The main purpose of the DL part of UK-RAMP has been to assist with sustainable software development and to agree coding standards so that the codes will be future-proof, as well as assistence with use of the codes on parallel High Performance Computing platforms (and to be ready for new HPC computer technologies). Particular assistence was given to the UKRMol CCPForge repository, with UKRMol being accessed by a wide group of developers and users. DL also had a specific task to interface part of UKRMol, 'UKRMol-in', to 'PFARM', a massively parallel 'outer region' part of the of electron-atom R-matrix code PRMAT: R-matrix theory separates configuration space into two regions divided by a sphere. While the full mathematical solution of the Schrodinger equation is not affected by this division, computationally the inner and outer region codes are distinct and rely on separate methods with distinct opportunities for efficiency, parallelization, optimization etc.

The communities developing the codes are working together effcieintly as a team (before UK-RAMP, atomic and molecular code developments were becoming a little isolated from each other).

The CCPForge site was established at part of a CCPQ core support NAG HECToR dCSE project for optimization of PFARM which predated UK-RAMP: the site has grown significantly since. Further details on inner region PRMAT may be found in the (joint CCPQ-core and UK-RAMP) inner region dCSE report included as a publication, while further PFARM details may be found at https://hpcforge.org/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/pfarm/index.php/Main_Page .

The collaboration with CCPQ core support enabled a dCSE project on the PRMAT inner region codes and PRACE 2IP funding for further optimization of PFARM (the latter is considered a CCPQ-core extra funding but the output has relevance for UK-RAMP applications: publications/presentations describing PFARM on novel technology platforms are included in the portfolio, and PFARM has demonstrated efficient performance on a heterogeneous Xeon-Phi platform. PFARM has been added to the PRACE Accelerator Benchmarking Suite. The expertise will, post-UK-RAMP be extended to the rest of UKRMol. The PRMAT inner region developments were relevant to a QUB (with DL) ARCHER eCSE project for Tier-0 level optimization of RMT (see separate collaboration entry). As part of further CCPQ core support funded development, a double-continuum version of the inner region codes is being developed over the course of 2015-2017. PFARM is being benchmarked against a separate R-matrix package (PSTGF) for both performance and results.
