Flowers are excellent systems to address this question since they are tremendously diverse, and one of the best examples of co-evolution, shaped by interplay between plants and pollinators. Indeed, understanding the underlying mechanisms that create diverse flower morphologies has a big potential impact on our ability to improve/restrict pollination, to alter crops and to sustain important biodiversity into the future. Diverse flower forms can be categorized as either radial (actinomorphic) or bilateral (zygomorphic). A radial flower has more than one plane of symmetry, whereas a bilateral flower has a single plane of symmetry. This floral zygomorphy is one of the key innovations for specialized flower-pollinator interactions, which has led to a rapid plant species radiation. The Asteraceae family (sunflower family, Compositea) is one of the largest flowering plant families and one of the most economically important crops and weeds. The evolutionary success of the Asteraceae family is mainly due to its flower head (capitulum), a key trait that defines the Asteraceae family taxonomically. Even though the flower head resembles a solitary flower, it is in fact an inflorescence with many small flowers (florets). The most common flower head form has marginal ray florets (bilateral) and a central dome of disc florets (radial). The mechanism that determines distinct symmetries of these two floret forms within a single flower head remains unclear. The aim of the project is to elucidate the underlying genetic mechanism(s) that establish the two floral symmetries within a single flower head and to identify and characterize novel genetic components which establish the position and identity of florets. For this study, Senecio vulgaris, an Asteraceae species, in which we have developed an easy transformation system, has been chosen. To understand the mechanism establishing the distinct floret symmetries, expression and functional analyses of the key regulators will be performed. We will determine genetic interactions and protein-protein interactions among these key regulators to understand the regulatory interactions among these regulators. To identify novel genetic components controlling the position and the identity of florets, we will generate and screen a GUS enhancer line collection and a T-DNA activation tagging line collection in S. vulgaris. This project will provide the first insight into the molecular mechanism of flower head pattern formation and its role in evolution, and, in particular, the parallel evolution of analogous structures (flower head vs. solitary flower). This will make a significant contribution to our understanding of how a complex form evolves and how the pre-existing genetic pathway is reinvented in the process. This project also includes developing GUS enhancer lines and T-DNA activation tagging lines in an Asteraceae model system. This will have enormous potential impact on plant research and agriculture (e.g., crop yield/quality and environmental sustainability). The Asteraceae family is one of the most economically important plant families (it includes lettuce and sunflower). However, the major limitation for Asteraceae research species has been the lack of feasible genetic tools for functional analysis. This availability of the transformation method in S. vulgaris provides a genuine and exciting opportunity to study S. vulgaris as an attractive Asteraceae model system, and to explore biological questions unique to Asteraceae and to broaden our knowledge to broader spectrum of species. It will allow us to study the economically important trait and genes in Asteraceae, which will improve crop yield and production of industrial biochemicals and medicinal chemicals from Asteraceae.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>How pattern formation and organogenesis occur and how different forms are generated and changed in nature are two fundamental questions in biology. Asteraceae is an excellent system to address these questions. The key trait that determines an Asteraceae (sunflower family) species is a unique structure called the 'flower head'. A flower head is a compressed inflorescence which mimics and functions as a solitary flower. The most common flower head form has marginal ray (bilateral) florets and a central dome of disc (radial) florets. The mechanism that determines distinct symmetries of these two florets within a single flower head remains unclear. Our preliminary data suggest that interplay among multiple sCYC genes plays an important role in creating two floret forms within a single flower head, providing a unique opportunity to investigate how duplication and diversification of a pre-existing pathway can create a novel or a more complex form. The aim of the project is to elucidate the underlying genetic mechanism(s) establishing the two floral symmetries within a single flower head by determining the expression patterns and the functions of sCYC genes, sRAD and sDIV, and the genetic/protein interaction among these genes. To identify/characterize novel genetic components establishing the position and the identity of florets, we will generate/screen a T-DNA tagged GUS enhancer line collection and a T-DNA activation tagging line collection. This project will unveil the genetic mechanisms controlling the floral symmetries in the flower head and evolution of complex forms, and also generate a genetic resource which will have enormous potential impact on crop improvement in the future.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work includes developing a T-DNA tagged GUS enhancer trap collection and a T-DNA activation tagging line collection in S. vulgaris using the floral dipping method. This has relevance to crop improvement, that will be important in the long term in responding to the challenges of global population growth and possible impacts of climate change. The Asteraceae family is one of the most economically important plant families. Asteraceae contains over 40 crops and six of the top noxious weeds. Lettuce is the one of the top 10 crops and the sunflower is third among the oil producing crops. Asteraceae plants are also a good source of novel secondary chemicals, e.g., insecticides, industrial fatty acids and medicinal chemicals. Many ornamental plants, e.g., chrysanthemum, marigold, zinnia, dahlia, daisy, are also members of Asteraceae. Developing a T-DNA tagged GUS enhancer trap collection and a T-DNA activation tagging line collection in S. vulgaris using the floral dipping method is a major breakthrough for plant science research and, importantly, agriculture and horticulture. In particular, it will provide a genetic platform to establish the field of Asteraceae research as potent as Arabidopsis and to broaden our understanding of evolution to a broader scale. It will allow us to study the economically important traits and genes which are unique in Asteraceae, which can be used to improve crop yield and production of industrial biochemicals and medicinal chemicals from Asteraceae. This project will allow us to understand the genetic mechanisms generating both bilateral (ray) and radial (disc) flower forms in a flower head. Understanding the mechanism controlling flower forms has big potential impact on improving crop yield and quality. In most crops, we consume or use the seed, fruit or flower parts, which are end-products of flower development. Understanding the mechanism creating flower forms will provide a means to create or alter flower forms, which will ameliorate our ability to improve crop quality and yield in the future. This research will have direct impact on developing more desirable ornamental and horticultural flowers. Ornamental and horticultural flower industry has growing steadily because demand for ornamental and horticultural flowers has increased as the quality of life improves. Flower forms affect flower-pollinator interactions dramatically, thus altering the flower forms can be a good way to promote/restrict pollination by insects. This can be potentially applied to breeding systems where pollination has to be controlled effectively and to sustain important biodiversity (plants and pollinators) into the future. The project includes training plant biologists. Training highly skilled plant scientists has relevance to the food security and crop improvement. Plant science research is one of the primary disciplines that will underpin the improvement of food security and crop yield/quality in responding to the challenges of global population growth and possible impacts of climate change. Unfortunately, the number of plant scientists in UK has been reduced dramatically and the shortage of plant scientists and plant research will be a big challenge in the future in terms of food security and crop improvement. The training provided in this project will provide a complete coverage of skills for the plant science including molecular genetic technique, histology, and transformation and also new tools to study Asteraceae.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>367109</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Plant Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>research collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>D93A3736-4595-4594-917B-6D0C1640BB96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>not started yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This collaboration will bring the CRISPR expertise to MK's lab that developed sunflower transformation</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>we will employ Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), to harvest primordia and perform RNASeq to identify novel regulators and pathways of floret patterning</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FLS community day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60274A97-52DF-4AC1-B350-5BA6B78EEF5A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>communicated to the public about Alan Turing and Fibonacci number.
