Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/H031464/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Each week, criminal firesetting costs England and Wales over &amp;pound;42 million and results in 65 casualties (Arson Prevention Bureau, 2009). Astonishingly, professionals hold little knowledge of firesetters. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will examine types of male firesetters, their treatment needs, and using this information, will develop, implement, and evaluate the first standardised treatment programme for firesetters. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Stage 1, firesetters and non-firesetter offenders will complete a battery of questionnaires designed to assess characteristics associated with firesetting. Here, statistical procedures will highlight natural subgroups of firesetters who share similar characteristics. Then, firesetters and non-firesetters will be compared on the questionnaires to see which characteristics differentiate firesetters from other offenders.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In Stage 2, a specialist group treatment programme for firesetters will be developed and implemented in prisons. Questionnaires established at Stage 1 will examine each firesetter's deficits before entering the programme, and then will be used to assess improvements on these deficits post treatment. Any improvements made by firesetters in the new treatment will then be compared with the performance of a comparison group of firesetters who do not attend this treatment. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The results of this research programme will highlight the main characteristics of firesetters and whether or not these can be treated successfully. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>513270</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>HMP Low Newton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

Previous to this project, there was no understanding of the treatment needs of deliberate firesetters and no standardised treatment programme for this common yet costly and tragic offence. The theory and research outcomes generated from our project have been used to design the first standardised treatment programmes for firesetters. Already the research is being used across the UK and Australia in the training, assessment, and treatment practices of clinical professionals who work with adult firesetters. As a result, enhanced specialised treatment of firesetters is being provided in secure establishments and community settings for the first time. Furthermore, the assessment and treatment programmes developed by the researchers now play a central role in the care, sentence planning, and parole decisions of firesetters in the UK. Consequently, this research formed one of the highly rated REF 2014 impact cases; facilitating the prestige and reputation of the ESRC and the University of Kent. 

The Fire Intervention Programme in Mental Health Hospitals:
Within both private and NHS secure hospitals, the specialist fire intervention programme is being utilised by psychologists, assistant psychologists and multidisciplinary professionals who have been specifically trained by the research team using a training package derived from the research. The specialist fire intervention programme is being implemented across 15 establishments run by 14 NHS or private health care trusts nationally. To date, 65 patients who have set fires have been treated using the programme and a similar number of patients who have set fires (but not received the programme) have acted as 'controls'. Professionals implementing the fire programme within these establishments have verified that the programme has developed a new care pathway for deliberate firesetters that did not exist previously; providing increased confidence to professionals working with this group, and improving overall treatment provision for this client group. For example, patients receiving the new specialist treatment are more likely to be offered residential accommodation in the community due to a reduction in their risk of setting fires. This means that their quality of life and ability to reintegrate into the community is improved as a result of our new specialist intervention.

The Fire Intervention Programme in Prisons:
Within HM Prison Service, the specialist fire intervention programme has been utilised by psychologists and assistant psychologists across four prison establishments in the South of England. All psychologists have been trained in full by the research team using a training package derived from the team's research and theory. Notably, prisoner transfers have taken place since January 2013 from prisons nationally to two target prisons to ensure that firesetters are having their particular needs met. To date, a total of 131 prisoners have been referred for specialist treatment, and 69 prisoners have received specialist treatment. Professionals from the establishments who have implemented the specialist treatment have verified that this treatment has played a key role in sentence planning and parole board hearings for firesetting prisoners and has met a need not previously met by existing HM Prison Service treatment programmes.

In addition to the specialist assessment and treatment programmes that were developed from the grant and are currently being utilised, the theory and research produced by the grant has been used by practitioner professionals both nationally and internationally in other assessment and intervention initiatives. For example, in Australia, Fritzon and colleagues (2013) have developed a treatment manual for individualized intervention with firesetters in the Australian community. The implementation of the intervention has just begun. Most notably, treatment provision within this intervention is planned according to the theory and research developed from this grant.

Furthermore, within the prison service and private practice in the UK, psychologists are also using the theory developed as part of the project (i.e., the M-TTAF) as an empirically informed guide to undertake risk assessments with deliberate firesetters. There are currently no validated risk assessments for use with firesetters and so in the absence of such a tool, professionals are using the theory in a clinically structured manner to develop their knowledge of this client group and to guide appropriate questioning for risk assessment purposes.

Building on this Impact
Finally, in order to secure longstanding impact, we will be using the outcomes of this grant to apply for a randomised clinical trial of the treatment we have developed. We have established the effectiveness of our treatment in a non-randomised design. However, establishing effectiveness in a randomised control trial will ensure that the programme takes centre stage within corrections and healthcare worldwide.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92BE475B-FA4E-4AD6-9589-38ADC094EB21</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary of findings

Stage 1
Treatment Needs. Significant differences were found between male firesetter and non-firesetter offenders on questionnaires designed to assess characteristics associated with firesetting (i.e., treatment needs). This suggested that firesetters are a unique group of offenders likely to benefit from specialist treatment (see Journal Article Output; Male Imprisoned Firesetters). Most significantly, firesetters reported a higher level of interest in serious fires, were more likely to normalise fire and also to identify with fire. Firesetters were also more likely to engage in anger-related rumination, hold lower levels of self-esteem, and indicated poorer fire safety awareness. An examination of mental health and personality characteristics showed that Borderline personality traits best predicted firesetting. 

Firesetter Types. Three natural subgroups of firesetters who share similar treatment needs emerged: (1) Multifaced firesetters (who endorse criminal attitudes and hold an interest in fire), (2) Grievance firesetters (who ruminate and set fires to gain revenge), and (3) Emotional firesetters (who endorse high levels of emotional isolation and mental disorder). 

PhD Thesis. A qualitative evaluation examining the offence narratives of a subgroup of the firesetters resulted in the development of a new model describing how the offence process unfolds for imprisoned male firesetters.

Stage 2
Using the Stage 1 research findings, a specialist Treatment Programme was developed and implemented with male firesetters in prisons (i.e., the Firesetting Intervention Programme for Prisoners; FIPP). In Stage 2 of the research, we examined each firesetter's deficits before entering the programme using the Stage 1 questionnaire measures, and assessed improvements on these deficits post treatment. We found that firesetters receiving specialist treatment provided as part of the project made a number of improvements in deficits associated with firesetting behaviour (e.g., improved fire safety knowledge) relative to control firesetters who did not attend specialist treatment. Most importantly, the gains made by firesetters within treatment were maintained 3 to 4 months following programme completion. Consistent with Stage 1 of the research, this supports the proposal that male firesetters are a unique group of offenders who require and benefit from specialist treatment. 

Unanticipated Project Outputs 
Five unanticipated project outputs were generated. First, from a detailed literature review we generated the first comprehensive theory of firesetting behaviour (see Journal Article Output; M-TTAF). Second, a theory of firesetting cognition was developed (see Journal Article Output; Implicit Theories). Both are now widely promoted for practitioner use when assessing and treating firesetters. Third, we were unexpectedly granted authorisation to access female offenders allowing us to replicate Stage 1 of the research with females. This led to the very first controlled study of female firesetters' treatment needs illustrating that they hold high levels of emotional problems rather than problems with fire per se. Fifth, we developed a new and advanced method of assessing fire interest and fire-related factors through a combination of established and newly developed scales. Finally, as a result of our collaboration with the NHS we developed a model describing the offence process for mentally disordered male and female firesetters (see Journal Article Output; Mentally Disordered Firesetters).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of potential economic and societal impacts anticipated in relation to this project. In the UK, our specialist firesetting programme is already being used by a number of forensic hospitals and prisons (see Impact Summary). We anticipate that the firesetting treatment programme developed as part of the project will become adopted by further hospitals and prisons in the UK (i.e., within private and NHS hospitals and in prison healthcare departments). In order to ensure this, we will be using the outcomes of this grant to apply for a randomised clinical trial of the treatment we have developed. 

Given the lack of specific treatment provision available for individuals who set fires, we anticipate that use of a new empirically tested treatment programme will increase the effectiveness of public and privately operated forensic services. We anticipate that the programme will enable men and women who have set fires to be released into the community at a reduced rate of reoffending limiting the threat to life and the UK economy caused by firesetting as well as re-arrests and associated costs related to re-admission to hospitals or prisons. Internationally, we anticipate that the research associated with the project will play an important role in shaping the assessment and treatment practices of practitioners worldwide. Our research has shown that offenders who set fires are a unique group of offenders who benefit from specialist treatment. Previously, policy makers and practitioners internationally had not established any particular assessment or treatment protocols for firesetting offenders due to the lack of research in this area. We anticipate that the models and research generated from this project will inform the policy and practice procedures of correctional and healthcare establishments worldwide.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BE17E596-373B-4F61-B7E8-38F634573472</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on Firesetting Practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7FA67C04-8A25-4BB0-BB93-83CC009E4F7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ESRC-funded theory, assessment, and treatment protocols developed by the researchers now play a central role in the care, sentence planning, and discharge and parole decisions of over 150 UK firesetters.
