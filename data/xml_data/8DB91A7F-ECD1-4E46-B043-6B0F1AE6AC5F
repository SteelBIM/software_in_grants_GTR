also Tampere and thanks also to you, Liisa, for making it happening.

Re: Misogony posing as measurement: Disrupting the Feminisation Discourse
 
I listened to your lecture at the ASME conference with great interest. I immediately thought of the book mentioned below, which I read a few years ago.
 
Adam's Curse: A Future Without Men by Bryan Sykes
 
In it he makes the case that the Y chromosome, because it has no partner to help repair damage, is slowly disintegrating. In about 125,000 years there will be no Y chromosome and no men!
 
Women have nothing to fear - they will eventually &amp;quot;rule&amp;quot; the world (presuming the problem of procreation is dealt with by then)!

Invitation to contribute a book chapter: from Professor Ron Barnett:


Dear Louise
 
I am following up our conversation in Trondheim, in which I mentioned I had been invited to edit a volume in the Taylor &amp;amp; Francis/ Routledge series, the overall editor of which is Prof Ted Tapper. I attach a note setting out a few ideas about the volume I am editing, as it see it just now. I would very much like you to be one of the contributors to the volume, perhaps building on the talk you gave at Trondheim.
 
Could I ask you, please:
 
a to let me know if you would feel able to contribute a chapter;
b offer me any thoughts you may have on the outline - anything missing you'd like to see?
c indicate any scholars internationally who you feel I could approach in confidence as other possible contributors.
 
On timing, I am simply trying to put together a proposal to go to the publishers in the Autumn. It will then be reviewed. So, even if/ when we get the green light, it will be probably late Autumn 2010 at the earliest for getting the manuscript to the publishers. So there'll be no undue press of time, I sense.
 
Looking forward to hearing from you,
 
Very best wishes
 
Ron
 
PS: I did so much enjoy your talk at Trondheim too!




1. Conference Report:

 Dear Louise,
 
 How are you?
 
 Right now Leif Martin Hokstad and I are working on the UNIQUAL 2009 Conference Report. We are editing a book with the contributions brought by the participants which will be published by Tapir Academic Press here in Trondheim. And we would like to have the pleasure of including the article of your presentation &amp;quot;Imagining the University of the Future&amp;quot;. Thus, I would like to ask if you would be interested in having your article published in our book.
 I would like to thank again for such an inspiring contribution to our Conference and I am looking forward we keep in touch in the new year!
 
 
 A happy 2010!

09 March 2010 

Dear Louise,

The peak period of the programme is, as informed earlier, May, with a 
small conference on May 16-17, and another peak period in 
mid-September-October. You are most welcome to come for a month in May 
(at least) and for another period (week or two?) in autumn - obviously 
this is negotiable and according to what suits your schedule.

For senior visiting fellows GEXcel will pay travel to and from Sweden, housing will be 
organised and the senior fellows will have an office and facilities at 
the university.

 I would also like to invite you as a keynote speaker in 
the conference on May 16-17 as well and would be very happy if you 
could make it.

Hi Louise

It was so nice to meet you last week at your seminar at UTS. I very much enjoyed your seminar and it gave me lots to think about. I thought I would send a link to my thesis on the possibilities of feminist scholarship, it's too much of an imposition on your time to read it in full but I thought it would give you an idea of my research while I work on a more digestible version. You can download a pdf here: http://hdl.handle.net/2100/1270

I am not sure when you will pick up this email. However, I wanted to thank you for your generosity when we met this afternoon at UTS- it is great to hear of your interesting work and other activities from across the globe. Perhaps we could get a virtual data base established through everyone adding in their work?

So thoughtful person you are.

I and my members (around 7 people)

For example, female researchers career path, or female
Workers career path and so on.

Please think about it.

1. After my talk, Sussex received an application from a PhD candidate.

Dear Prof. Morley, 

We have meet at the GEXcel conference in &amp;Ouml;rebro university, Sweden. I am originally from Ethiopia and now MA student of Prof. Kehm at the university of Kassel, Germany. I was really glad to learn about you, your research and project works and talk to you during the conference. 

As I mentioned I would like to do doctoral study on women academics in African higher education institutions. I have been working on the experiences of women academics in Ethiopia for my master thesis. Based on my finding I would like to further expand the scope of the study and carry out a broader study. 

I basically want to study about what promote the academic career of women in south African universities. I would be glad if you can assist me on how I can further proceed with this theme and how I can approach access to your institutions. I have read much of your works so I hope you can direct me to the right way.

Thank you very much,

with best regards,

Dear Louise,

It was absolutely wonderful to meet you last week and learn more about your research projects. I too hope we can continue to find ways to work together. Our students here benefited tremendously from your talks and class, and I have just forwarded your brochure regarding the annotated bibliography to our Women's Studies Librarian (Phyllis Weisbard) with the request to order a few copies for teaching and research. What a wonderful resource, and I'm sorry I did not see it earlier.

I hope your trip to Chicago was enjoyable and your work is going well. I look forward to seeing you again next. Perhaps at CIES? http://www.cies.us/

1. I received a number of requests:

Dear Professor Morley,

I am Books Editor of Times Higher Education. I noted your name and perceptive comments in our pages last week (reporting on the Bera conference) and resolved to ask you whether you would do us the honour of reviewing for us. 

I've a new edited volume I am keen to cover in our pages and hope you will have the time and interest to write the review for us. A fee is payable for this review.

The book is:
Higher Education and the Market
Edited by Roger Brown
Routledge

You can read a little more about the book here:
http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415991698/

I would be looking for a review of 600 words by 4 October, although I am open to a little haggling over the deadline if it would make it easier for you to say yes. I've a copy of the book to hand and would be pleased to send it to you, along with our pretty straightforward reviewers' guidelines, directly that you give me the nod.

The majority of our scholar-reviewers are tremendously busy people, and if you must decline I'll understand. But I do hope you will say yes!

Best regards,
Karen Shook

I received emails:

Dear Prof Morly,

I want to sincerely thank you, the stakeholders and orgaisers of what was the most educative academic conference you invited me to. 
The presentations were superberb= the case studies and the lead papers were educative.They threw light on all the issues affecting the tertiary system in Africa. 

I noted one particular concept- ''sexual corruption'', a persistent socail virus in the tertiary secotor in Africa. In most of Africa, sadly, the trend counts for the many insidious business as usual stuff, and so no sanction is put in place to curb it.

One other thing anout the conference is that it helped throw light as well as justify my request for according similar project to my country- Sierra Leone. In this light I still request that you give me/us that golden opportunity. You would agree with me that considering the precarious position of wartorn country like Sierra Leone, such a project would help expose some of the chronic socail malaises and failings in our educational system. 

Please help!!!

I wish you and your family a merry Xmas and prosperious New Year

Hi Louise
 
I am just working on a chapter for a book (US) that ostensibly relates to the needs to transform business education - I have been given the task of a summative 'rant' about what is wrong with the current approach!!! I notice that you recently delivered a keynote that probably overlaps with this theme. I wondered whether you would be happy to send me a copy / notes so that I can cross reference to this. I would also welcome any other thoughts / comments that you may have - my basic premise is that what we do is no longer fit for purpose - we are locked in time, tradition and real estate and we will soon be living with the consequences of that!
 
Many thanks
