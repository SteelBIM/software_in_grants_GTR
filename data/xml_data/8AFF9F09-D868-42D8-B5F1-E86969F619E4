The subject of derived categories emerged in the second half of the 20th century as a distillation of the ideas of homological algebra, which calculates invariants of a topological space such as its &amp;quot;number of n-dimensional holes&amp;quot;. While more high brow and abstract than the more primary methods of attaching invariants to a mathematical or physical object, the derived category has a number of important advantages, allowing us to see so-called &amp;quot;quantum symmetries&amp;quot; of manifolds that are inaccessible to more conventional theories. They are thus an essential ingredient of attempts to understand the mathematics of physically important theories such as string theory, mirror symmetry and supersymmetry.

Starting from the top, the more theoretical aspects covered during the year involve abstract notions such as higher category theory, DG enhancements and derived geometry. These are substantial generalisations of conventional geometry and category theory, and the theory is currently at the level of understanding and standardising the foundations of the new subject. This is an exciting stage in the development of a mathematical theory, but not one that can be convincingly explained in simple terms. Our symposium will run several schools and workshops at different levels expanding on these matters.

At the other extreme, derived categories feed back into explicit calculations that can be applied to give useful results describing the properties of usual objects of algebra, geometry and theoretical physics. For example, derived categories have provided by far the best treatment of the McKay correspondence, that relates the representation theory of a finite subgroup G in SL(2,CC) or SL(3,CC) with the topology of a resolution of the orbifold quotient CC^n/G. In a similar vein, our symposium will include workshops studying derived category approaches to the study of different moduli spaces and their invariants (such as the classical moduli spaces of vector bundles, or of algebraic curves).

In between these two extremes is a rich body of theories and problems in algebra, geometry and physics to which it is known or suspected that derived category methods can be applied. This includes issues arising from string theory, such as homological mirror symmetry, that works around the conjecture that the derived category mediates between the complex geometry of a Calabi-Yau 3-fold and the symplectic geometry of its mirror partner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7281</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop &quot;Geometry from stability conditions&quot; (EPSRC Symposium 2015-16)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BB93A0B-913F-4422-990B-495A1F5971B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The topic of this workshop will be applications of the theory of stability conditions to results in algebraic geometry.

His motivation was to obtain new information about certain moduli spaces. Since then, the theory has been massively developed and applied. The VBAC 2015 workshop will review these developments and draw attention to potential new applications.
The focus of the workshop will be the interaction between the study of derived categories and more classical problems in algebraic geometry. Topics to be covered include enumerative geometry, the geometry of moduli spaces of sheaves and Bridgeland stability.

As result we've developed a new method for DG-enhancing the derived categories of coherent sheaves on algebraic varieties, and more generally the derived category of modules over a small DG-category A. It is called the bar category of modules \modbar(A), and it is a DG-enhancement of the derived category D(A) of A which is isomorphic to the category of DG A-modules with A-infinity morphisms between them. However, it is defined intrinsically in the language of DG-categories and requires no complex machinery or sign conventions of A-infinity categories. We defined for these bar categories Tensor and Hom bifunctors, dualisation functors, and a convolution of twisted complexes. The intended application is to working with DG-bimodules as enhancements of exact functors between triangulated categories.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F88CF995-522B-4560-AFD7-1CA9B346CC98</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Immediately, as a demonstration of the power of our new method we've applied it to write down a theory of homotopy adjunction for tensor functors (R. Anno, T. Logvinenko, &amp;quot;Bar category of modules and homotopy adjunction for tensor functors&amp;quot;, 2016, arXiv:1612.09530). 

We have then applied to write down the notion of non-split P-functors, which was a long-standing open problem (R.Anno, T.Logvinenko, &amp;quot;P-functors&amp;quot;, in progress). We are also in process of applying it to write down the notion of DG-enhanced monads and their categories of algebras (S.Arkhipov, T.Logvinenko, &amp;quot;On DG-enhanced monads&amp;quot;, in progress).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Bar category of modules</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09530</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E14CD9E7-FDDA-4358-B51B-7D2F0A47B3AA"><gtr:id>E14CD9E7-FDDA-4358-B51B-7D2F0A47B3AA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Derived Reid's recipe for abelian subgroups of SL3(C)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal f?r die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelles Journal)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9f82dd67e4ac5876299d59953fc9df3c"><gtr:id>9f82dd67e4ac5876299d59953fc9df3c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Cautis S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CC5D6154-21C6-47EA-8EB1-3CC8B007F302"><gtr:id>CC5D6154-21C6-47EA-8EB1-3CC8B007F302</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bar category of modules and homotopy adjunction for tensor functors</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ArXiv e-prints</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/76b70d8752216164cee620e8a6b33046"><gtr:id>76b70d8752216164cee620e8a6b33046</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anno Rina</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/25EAB645-8C09-40F3-94AF-E753EA34D245"><gtr:id>25EAB645-8C09-40F3-94AF-E753EA34D245</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spherical DG-functors</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the European Mathematical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f92f5542f75de993093c2da4330a9e32"><gtr:id>f92f5542f75de993093c2da4330a9e32</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anno R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L018594/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABA2EC9F-6524-443A-BB92-7DF199FE4B25</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical Physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
