An OLG-CGE model attempts to provide a comprehensive description of an economy using a system of equations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The model has an age-disaggregated structure, which allows the modelling of age-specific preferences and behaviour, such as labour supply, productivity, consumption structure, saving behaviour, and retirement decisions. The rich demographic structure of an OLG-CGE model allows for the direct evaluation of the aggregate effects of various scenarios as well as their impacts on different generations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The multiregional dimension is important because of the regional variations both in the characteristics of demographic change and in policy. Many of the policies that relate most directly to, or are affected by, demographic change are devolved. There are already differences in the policies of the devolved regions on education, health and care for the elderly, and these are likely to diverge more in the future. The implications of having different policies in different regions could potentially generate complex and unexpected interactions between the regional economies. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the most important and long lasting impacts of this project will be the integration of the UK into the international network of OLG-CGE modellers. This modelling approach is widely used by academic institutions, research institutes, international organisations and governments for simulating the effects of policy and exogenous shocks on the economy. There are research teams working with large-scale OLG-CGE models in the US, Canada, Germany and France. The World Bank, OECD and US government use this type of model for policy simulations. The UK currently lacks a large-scale multiregional OLG-CGE modelling capacity and is not integrated into the international modelling network. This project will close this gap through the development of a UK model, international collaboration with the modelling team at the University of Ottawa, close informal contacts with the Regional Economics Applications Laboratory (REAL) at the University of Illinois and networking at international conferences, workshops and seminars. 
The output of this project will make important contributions to two areas of research. The first is the subject of population ageing and its macro- and meso-economic effects. A wide interdisciplinary (economic, social and demographic) audience will benefit from the findings. The second area is multiregional OLG-CGE modelling. This method would add new capabilities to the existing pool of modelling tools, such as input-output (IO) models, social accounting matrix (SAM) models, static and dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) models. 
Understanding the effect of population ageing on the economy is crucial for supporting a well-informed public debate on this issue. This project will contribute to existing substantial research in this area by providing new evidence using state of the art methodology. The results of this project will be of great interest to a wide range of stakeholder groups including: national policymakers, for developing policy on labour market regulations and social security provision; policymakers in the devolved regions, who are responsible for education policy and provision of public services; local businesses involved in care and health provision; educational and health authorities; and the wider public, who will be affected by population ageing and the economic policy response. To name just a few government departments and agencies that will be particularly interested in the project findings: the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Treasury, the Office of Budget Responsibility, the NHS, the Scottish Government, the Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. I will identify key representatives of stakeholder groups and maintain a dialogue with them throughout the duration of the project. This will ensure that the progress and findings of the project are disseminated effectively to all stakeholder groups. This process has already been initiated through discussion with the Department of Work and Pensions, the Office of Budget Responsibility and the Scottish Government, and senior representatives from all three have agreed to act as reviewers for the project application.
One of the project outputs will be an integrated inter-regional database linking the four UK regions. The database will be made available for other researchers and research organisations on the websites of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) and the Fraser of Allander Institute (FAI).
The project will have a lasting legacy in the form of a flexible modelling framework that can subsequently be very widely applied. The proposed specification of the model is intentionally very versatile to allow simulation over a broad range of topics, running from fiscal policy to energy use, and from carbon emissions to climate change. These topics will not be addressed in this project but once the basic framework is in place it can be easily adapted and extended</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166240</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ottawa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Marcel Merette of University of Ottawa</gtr:description><gtr:id>319BB606-F959-4B7C-8006-B5F5E15BF4EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three research visits to University of Ottawa (over 60 days)

Thomas Davoine of the Institute of Advanced Studies (Vienna, Austria) presented his work on modelling pension reforms in Europe, and Professor Marcel M&amp;eacute;rette of the University of Ottawa (Ottawa, Canada) talked about modelling the effects of international trade in the context of an ageing population. 
This event attracted around 60 attendants.

The models that were built as a result of this grant allow modelling the effects of demographic factors on the economy. And we are living in a time when demographic factors play very important and sometimes decisive role in the events of high importance.
The two areas where the developed modelling framework was applied and had significant impact on public debate are: (1) Economic effects of migration and (2) Scottish independence referendum.
1. Economic effects of migration. This highly politicised and topical issue has been in the public focus for several years now. A lot of research greatly improved the quality of the discussion. The project allowed me and my team to write two papers on the macroeconomic effects of migration on the UK economy, which provided additional evidence for the public discussion. 
The first paper launch was accompanied by the public event (The effect of reducing migration &amp;quot;from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands&amp;quot;), which attracted large audience (around 60 people) and a lot of interest. It was covered in the national and international media (FT, ITV news, Telegraph, Mail online, Herald Scotland, City A.M., Reuters, Fortune, Business week, New Statesman etc.). I also gave interviews on Channel 4 news and Voice of Russia radio. 
The second paper came out shortly before the Brexit referendum and attracted a lot of attention, since migration was arguably one of the most discussed topics during the campaign. There was a press conference associated with it (&amp;quot;The long-term macroeconomic effects of lower migration to the UK&amp;quot;) which attracted a lot of attention and the results of the research were extensively covered in the media (BBC, Guardian, FT, Sky news, Daily Mail, Telegraph, Evening Standard, The Conversation UK, International Business Times etc.). I also gave an interview on BBC news channel and on Talk Radio. I also gave a talk at the Greater London Authority on the same topic.
Recently HM Treasury contacted me about the possibility of using my model to estimate the effects of migration changes as a result of Brexit. 
2. Scottish independence referendum. A lot of the public discussion during the referendum campaign was concentrated on differences in demographic trends in Scotland and the rest of the UK. I used a multi-regional version of the model to study the effects of Scottish independence on sustainability of its public finances.
The paper was launched at the public lecture in Edinburgh organised together with the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE). It was also covered in the regional and national media (FT, Guardian, STV, Herald Scotland, Scotsman etc.).
This work will lead to development of new multiregional CGE model for Scotland and the rest of the UK to reflect the new Fiscal Framework.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>43764740-6031-4A6E-9CCC-3E25750AE99F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The main objective of the project was to build a versatile dynamic OLG-CGE model for the UK. As the result of this project our team created several versions of the National Institute General Equilibrium model of Ageing - NiAGE:
? Multiregional model. In this version the modelled economy is made up of three regions: Scotland, the rest of the UK (RUK) and the rest of the World (ROW). It can straightforwardly be extended to include Wales and Northern Ireland. This version was used to study the effects of population ageing in Scotland in the context of Scottish referendum on independence. Our main result was that Scotland would be worse off after independence although the effect of independence is small relative to the overall effect of population ageing in the economy. 
? With detailed treatment of migration. This version is suitable for simulations of interaction of demographic transition with migration policy. We used it to study the long-term effects of reducing net migration &amp;quot;from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands&amp;quot;. We found that the significant reduction in net migration has strong negative effects on the economy in general and public finances in particular. Currently we are extending this model further and preparing to study the effects of possible migration scenarios after the potential Brexit. 
? Multisector model. In this version there are three sectors: 1) health, 2) education and 3) the rest of the economy. Differentiation of health and education sectors allows performing detailed simulations of the effect of demographic change on the provision of public health and education services. The model has been tested and we plan to use it to project public healthcare costs and their decomposition along the main contributing factors. 
? Qualification disaggregation. In this version households of each generation are divided into three qualification levels. It is useful to study the effects of demographic change on human capital accumulation and productivity. We plan to use this model to study the effects of population ageing on intergenerational inequality.
? With age-variable rate of time preference - this model proposes experimental way of calibration, which allows perfect matching of the age-consumption profile from the data into the model. Our results suggest that conventional models underestimate the effects of population ageing on the macroeconomy.
This versatile suite of models is capable to address a large variety of topical questions connected with demographic transition. This capability is unique in the UK and will be maintained and developed in the future.
During the course of the project we wrote 6 papers, 4 of which were already published in journals, 1 book chapter (already published), delivered 12 seminars and presentations, organised 2 public events, and 2 modelling workshops, participated in 6 workshops and made presentation at 10 conferences. Our research was covered in national and international media, I gave TV and radio interviews. As the result of this knowledge exchange activity we joined the international network of modellers and specialists in the field and gained valuable contacts with policy community and wider group of stakeholders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My current plans include further research using the developed models. First, before the UK Brexit referendum I will publish a paper on the effects of the within-EU migration on the UK economy. This is arguably the most important topic during this debate and it is important to inform public views with solid evidence. Second, I am collaborating with research teams at the University of Kent and Glasgow University who work in the field of health economics. We plan to use the multisectoral model for projections of future public healthcare costs. Third, I had interest from the DWP regarding using the model in analysing the effects of extending working lives - the most important issue in the context of population ageing. 
All research that we did and plan to do using the models is very applied and policy relevant. We have contributed to the public debate on immigration, Scottish independence and pension system reform in Belarus. I have provided evidence to the Scottish Parliament Finance Committee during their discussion on the creation of an independent fiscal/forecasting body in Scotland. The decision was taken to create a Scottish Fiscal Commission. Later I gave evidence during the discussion on its remit.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A1EB9F0-D9A7-42AE-91DF-F99C9D60610D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.niesr.ac.uk/projects/niage-project</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EVIDENCE ON SCOTTISH FISCAL COMMISSION BILL</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93B7F30E-250E-451A-BCC8-50F84C2ED488</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave evidence on the functions of the Scotland Fiscal Commission as described in the Scotland Fiscal Commission Bill.
