Disruption: the raw material for low carbon change</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J00460X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Evidence suggests that we will need to change our travel habits and practices radically if we are to reduce the carbon emissions from transport to meet government and international targets. Technological developments such as hybrid and electric cars will, to some extent, allow us to reduce our carbon impact and maintain current lifestyles, but they cannot provide all of the necessary reductions in emissions, nor quickly enough. Our travel practices - why, where and how we travel - are a function of the many choices that make up our daily lives; it is difficult to untangle them from our patterns of housing, employment, education, leisure and so on. But we must do so if we are to bring about significant reductions in emissions whilst maintaining quality of life. At the same time, transport policies and the policy-making systems that produce them have developed a number of cultural assumptions, most importantly that travel practices are very stable and that it is very difficult to change both people's travel choices and policy makers' existing ways of thinking.

In spite of this, there are actually many times when our everyday lives become disrupted, and these events provide windows of opportunity where change becomes possible. Within a seemingly stable overall pattern of transport demand, we are often forced to rethink our usual way of carrying out our everyday lives, and organisations are forced to reconsider how they operate. These disruptions can occur at different levels, from the disruption of a broken leg that means a mother cannot drive her children to school, to the disruption from a volcanic eruption such as the 2010 Icelandic ash cloud that left people stranded thousands of miles from home and businesses with their key employees unable to fulfil their normal roles. It is the potential for these kinds of opportunities to lead to more permanent carbon-reducing changes that this project seeks to explore. This project is an in-depth study of the way we travel and the assumptions we make, how this changes when our lives are disrupted and how the more positive changes can be embedded in everyday life, in organisations and in policy-making.

The research explores travel practices in a range of places and social contexts, with the understanding that these different contexts influence the ways we travel and how we reduce barriers to positive change. We will study at close hand how disruption affects the real choices people make, and what this teaches us about the opportunities to change travel practices at individual level and within families; in organisations that generate travel demand and impact on our own individual travel decision-making; and within government where policy that determines our travel opportunities is made. We will use a range of innovative research methods to do this including capturing travel behaviour through Facebook and Twitter and carrying out video-recorded mobile interviews. Those taking part in the research will be able to choose how they work with researchers to best capture their travel experiences and how these are influenced by different disruptions, which they identify as being significant. The project then brings together the different social actors, both 'lay' and 'expert' in a number of forums where they have the opportunity to 'deliberate' the different issues that will emerge throughout the research, and challenge each other about what needs to be done to capture the opportunities for change. Lastly the project seeks to establish mechanisms for embedding these changes in everyday life, in organisational practices and in social policy, so that a substantial contribution to reducing carbon emissions from transport is achieved.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will radically alter the way policymakers think about travel behaviour and open up a whole new range of opportunities and strategies developing policies for getting people to adopt new low carbon travel practices, and then ensuring these become locked in.

There are three ways in which findings from the research will impact directly on transport policy:

1) Recognition of the many opportunities that exist to shift people's transport modes or behaviour during points of 'natural' disruption so that the terms of the transport policy debate can be radically reset;
2) Enabling the formulation and implementation of policies that will allow legitimised interventions in the socio-technical systems that generate travel practices, in order to drive transitions to low carbon travel; 
3) Allowing the development of long-term strategies for steering socio-technical systems in order to prevent the continued 'lock-in' of existing high carbon travel practices, and thereby also increase societal resilience to major disruptive events.

The impacts on transport policy are likely to be relevant at all government levels. The lessons will also demonstrate the significant role that businesses and third sector organisations also play in determining modern travel practices. These groups are part of the research process alongside significant research with citizens. The project will deliver its ambitions on impact on the policy process and on practice by allowing the actors to jointly shape the research recommendations through active participation at various stages in the project.

The project findings have the potential to not just to upset conventional thinking on travel behaviours, but also to create a step change in terms of behavioural understanding in a range of other areas, where carbon intensive activities are seen as being entrenched, habitual and resistant to change. The project will draw on the range of stakeholders engaged in the research to act as advocates in discussing how the work might be applied elsewhere.

The cross-disciplinary nature of the project will set a new standard for bringing together different approaches (quantitative and qualitative, psychological and sociological) in a way that is targeted at ensuring that the strongest lesson from each can be used to understand and change the socio-technical systems that currently lock-in unsustainable behaviours. The detrimental effects of these behaviours go well beyond the issue of carbon, and include quality of life, public health issues of air pollution and obesity, and economic impacts on businesses. These are all areas into which the project team are already plugged in, ensuring that the learning will not remain the sole preserve of the transport sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1113524</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop with Travel Behaviors Network at Future Cities Catapult, London 15/6/15 (Greg Marsden, Tim Chatterton)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>610D564E-4F1A-41C7-A555-1998774E9C4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation and exhibition stand led to considerable discussion with a range of practitioners about the project findings.

The results of the analysis were published in September 2016. The findings were consistent with Transport Scotland's own understanding of behavioural adaptation based on traffic counts and other aggregate data sources. However, the data provided a much more in-depth understanding of which types of users and journeys were affected. Transport Scotland subsequently decided to hold a workshop to share the findings and to promote the sharing of lessons learnt from managing the Forth Road Bridge Closure. The remit of the workshop was broadened to include a range of severe weather resilience events from other parts of the UK and was supported by further funding from the Research Councils UK Impact Acceleration funding stream.

A workshop was held on Tuesday 15th November at the Studio, Glasgow. The event was attended by 32 participants across 24 different organisations. The event was facilitated by Professor Greg Marsden, Professor Jillian Anable and Jeremy Shires (ITS Leeds) and Professor Iain Docherty (University of Glasgow). Participants were sent four case studies of major disruptions, the institutional response and what was understood about the wider transport impacts. The case studies were of the Forth Road Bridge, Storm Desmond in Cumbria, Storm Desmond in Calderdale and Storm Eva in the City of York.

The workshop looked at four different areas:
? Understanding the diversity of users on the network and their needs;
? The role of information and communication in managing disruptions;
? The effectiveness of actions to adapt transport and non-transport services; and
? Understanding the social and economic impacts of such events.

It concluded by exploring important findings, recommendations and knowledge gaps.

Area 1: Importance of Multi-Agency Response
Area 2: Communication is critical and also changing rapidly
Area 3: Broadening the understanding of the impacts of disruption
Area 4: Greater diversity of data types and better access
Area 5: Understanding and building community resilience
Area 6: Understanding the distribution of economic impacts

Yes
How have your findings been used? Please provide a brief summary.
Our disruption work is now generating impact in two distinct ways. The first is its contribution is from our better understanding of travel behaviour under conditions of disruption, which is changing how transport agencies and others plan for disruption and how to react to it. We have conducted workshops with policy teams across the UK including local authorities, the Scottish Government and Department for Transport (?) to help review their policies. In particular, we have engaged in collaborative co-production of with City of York Council, West Yorkshire Combined Authority andTransport for Greater Manchester to help them understand how the underlying churn in travel behaviour they have identified can be used to develop new transport policies and plans that help people shift their behaviour to more sustainable patterns. For example, ticketing systems need to adapt so that occasional as well as regular non-car use is more attractive. Our work with Transport Scotland on the impacts of the Forth Road Bridge Closure, which comprised large openly-available surveys, led to the development of some formal guidance for resilience response which TS are sharing with other UK government departments and agencies.

The second strand of our work is about the governance and policy adaptations required to cope with the 'smart mobility' transition. The increasing importance of 'mobility on demand' services such as UBER and equivalents, and the impending automation of large parts of the vehicle fleet, will require a number of systematic responses if wider social, economic and environmental goals for transport are to be safeguarded. This work led to the publication of a working paper by the OECD/International Transport Forum in 2016, and in 2017 we will host the research day component of the ITF Global Forum working with transport agencies and service providers to exchange knowledge with them so that their services can be better designed, and regulatory frameworks made appropriate.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D63A79C8-9CB0-49D7-9153-C496F828CBF9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Disruption project was undertaken to understand whether, by looking at periods of change (planned and unplanned) in people's lives we could understand more about how best to intervene to change travel behaviour to reduce energy use and cut carbon emissions.

The research has developed three new lines of knowledge. The first builds from the detailed ethnographic work with families in Brighton and Lancaster which has led to the production of new knowledge and research papers which explain much more about the role of families, obligations and identity in travel and also the importance of equipment and competencies in shaping what feels possible.

The second line of progress comes from the work undertaken to understand how people adapt to periods of disruption. Unplanned events have included major snow and ice events, prolonged flooding and, more recently through additional funding to the closure of the Forth Road Bridge. Planned events included the Olympics in 2012, a planned bridge closure and a major office reconsolidation in York. The ability to get surveys conducted during the unplanned disruptive events has provided a unique set of insights into how people adapt and the issues around adaptation. This is being turned into a series of practical guides to change local and national government practice and research papers.

Taken together, the insights on behavioural change and the conditions that need to be in place to support that have led to the production of a policy green paper called &amp;quot;Flexi-mobility&amp;quot; which provides a summary of the potential for behaviour change and the policy actions that are required. Instead of expecting change from everyone and all of the time, the findings suggest that we need to create the conditions and policy framework where it becomes more normal to use a range of modes for different journeys more of the time. These have been worked up into policy briefings and attempts are on-going to embed this in two major northern cities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work is currently being further developed into action plans for cities. Importantly we also aim to take the findings to politicians as they challenge some of the firmly established assumptions about what we are designing our transport systems for. 

The work on responses to unplanned disruption is part of the resilience debate and has been influential in discussions in winter 2015/16 where a series of storms have shown just how vulnerable the UK is to weather events. Our work is demonstrating what kinds of social adaptation need to go on alongside the infrastructural changes that are planned. The work was used to produce a briefing note for the OECD Council of Ministers on Transport conference in Leipzig in May 2016. We also ran a major behavioural survey alongside the closure of the Forth Road Bridge in late 2015 which has followed through into a major workshop around how to improve resilience planning for Transport Scotland in late 2016</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>86705623-D9F9-40D7-B0E8-E2C0A5C73C55</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
