These coatings actively change their properties to let the optimum amount of light and heat into a building, dramatically reducing the energy required for heating and cooling. Heating and cooling buildings can use a large proportion (&amp;gt;30%) of a nation's energy requirements, so improvements in this area offer real benefits, and will assist meeting national and international carbon emission targets. 

We will deposit vanadium dioxide films using a variety of industrially scalable techniques, and characterise the films with state of the art apparatus. We will undertake quantitative energy efficiency modelling to accurately predict the energy saving that might be expected when these materials are used in real buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have impact in a number of areas through development of new science and clear routes to implementation of important energy saving technology. The following beneficiaries can be identified: 

*The UK and Chinese economy through the design and development of new sustainable and scalable manufacturing methods for forming thermochromic coatings. Commercial and economic benefits will occur through development into the processing methods for the upscale manufacture of these materials ensuring the UK and CN maintain a world-leading capability in the manufacturing of ground-breaking energy saving technologies.

*People will benefit through the technical expertise developed throughout the project by the research team, including the training received and the range of transferable skills developed via interaction with industry, academics, engagement with the media, the general public, policy makers and legislators. 
 
*Academic and industrial research community will benefit since significant advances in alternative precursor strategies, film deposition, modelling and scale up will be delivered during the project.

*Society will benefit by developing science and technology to improve energy efficiency, help meet national and internation carbon emission targets through implementation of energy efficient technologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>435723</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>DIAMOND Light Source Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Diamond Light source</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F20B538-D229-413F-BE49-A98EAE32E693</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have recently collected X-ray absorption spectroscopic data at Diamond Light Source.

This material has been chemically modified (addition of dopants) or designed as part of an array of semiconductors for optimum functionality (optical properties, thermochromic transition temperature, etc.). In particular, we have successfully developed a robust multilayered VO2/SiO2/TiO2 film with ideal properties (solar modulation, transparency, self-cleaning properties) for energy efficient intelligent window applications. This work has now been published in a renowned international journal (Chemistry of Materials). In addition, we have been successful (peer reviewed application in a competitive environment) in obtaining 5 days of Synchrotron beam time at the European Synchrotron research facility (ESRF), France, to conduct in-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) combined with high resolution powder diffraction (XRD) measurements of the samples prepared in this project. The monetary value of the obtained beam time is ca 50,000 Euros (10,000 Euros per day). We have now applied for additional beam time for further studies using the XAS technique and are developing metal-doped materials for the optimisation of the temperature switch of our multilayered thermochromic coatings. 
Since the commencement of the joint project (October, 2014), we had a first video conference with our partner at Wuhan University of Technology (WUT), China. Subsequently, the UK scientists (three named investigators and the PDRA working in this project) visited Wuhan University (April, 2015) in order to establish further interaction and share knowledge of our preliminary findings. Recently, scientists and students from WUT visited us (November, 2015) and one of them (Dr Baushun Liu) extended his stay for a month to strengthen the collaboration. Currently, we are exchanging samples between the two groups to utilise strengths and expertise to fully understand the properties of the films produced in this joint work. Robert Palgrave (Co-I) presented initial results from the project at the RSC Solid State Chemistry Meetingheld in Glasgow. In addition, we have been awarded beam time at Diamond in March 2017 to carry out further X-ray spectroscopic measurements, which carries a value of ca 4000 GBP. The results will be published soon in an international Journal. Prof Gopinathan Sankar was invited to give a Plenary talk in Shanghai in an international conference on thin films in November 2016. Prof Gopinathan Sankar along with PDRA and PhD student associated with project from UCL attended a project review meeting in July 2017 at Wuhan University and about 15 people attended this meeting to discuss the progress of our collaborative work. Based on this visit, One Young member of WUT staff, Dr Shouqin Tian obtained scholarship from Chinese Funding Agency and visiting our group for one year to carry out the collaborative work.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are publishing our results in peer reviewed scientific Journal which can be accessed by many academics and industrialists. This way the community will be benefitted by our methods of making such functional materials. We are going through a critical stage of the project to produce more efficient coatings of our material and test its wide range applicability. Once successful, we will present the work in various forms to be taken forward by either academics of industrialists</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D4A2320C-C439-4617-AC04-8D522D4FD0CB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Construction,Energy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2DE39694-9329-4D57-BAF2-FBF65ADB1011"><gtr:id>2DE39694-9329-4D57-BAF2-FBF65ADB1011</gtr:id><gtr:title>Intelligent Multifunctional VO2/SiO2/TiO2Coatings for Self-Cleaning, Energy-Saving Window Panels</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemistry of Materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9a1326cdc0dbdf86d471d67ef578a64f"><gtr:id>9a1326cdc0dbdf86d471d67ef578a64f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Powell M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M003353/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0F0B5443-BE5E-4DB6-823E-B7E33EE35922</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>33</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil Engineering Materials</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
