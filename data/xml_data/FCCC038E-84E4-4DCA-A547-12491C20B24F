The approach in the research is sociological, which highlights the transformations and changes unfolding in society. Therefore, the research questions focus on the ways in which the social experiences of migrants in their 'originating' and 'destination' localities influence them politically. In particular the research design takes particular account of the political changes in the migrants' 'originating' localities and the structure of the industry in which they seek employment in the 'destination' localities. The research proposes to use a combination of methods to develop a textured account of these influences: the methods include ethnography, surveys and elite interviews. The analysis will be qualitative, directing attention to migrants' meanings, feelings and practices in relation to politics. 
The project will make the following contributions to the field. One, it will focus attention on the internal, rather than international, dimension of migration. Two, it will emphasize the political, rather than economic, implications of migration. Three, it will highlight the constructed and multi-faceted aspects of political identities, against static and singular views. Fourth, it will consider the circulation of ideas, identities and practices between 'originating' and 'destination' localities of migrants, instead of assuming that these are remitted only from 'destination' to 'originating' localities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to academia, the research will impact the following stakeholders: workers; employers; Government; and civil society. As a result I have taken care to develop this proposal in consultation with them and taking their suggestions and insights on board. 
This research will impact workers by providing activists in civil society with summaries of the destinations to which they travel. This data will enable activists to make contact with workers' associations in the 'destination localities' and provide migrant workers with relevant advice and support. It will also impact workers if the State Government uses the data to establish a migrant services unit responsible for their well-being during their time in the 'destination localities'. The research will impact employers by enabling them to understand better the conditions in which their workers live and impress upon them the need for a more productive workforce. 
The research will impact the government of one of the States in which this research will be conducted. The research speaks to the need expressed in the government for accurate and reliable information on migrants' destination localities. This research will serve as a template for such data to be collected at the level of the local government without the government incurring any additional expense. They will also be able to demonstrate innovation in data gathering and management. Policy briefs- specially prepared in Hindi- will be disseminated among them to keep them informed about the project's implications for policy: they will be prepared thrice during the life of the project (March 2016, December 2016, September 2017).
The research will impact activists and other relevant and interested actors in civil society by presenting them with data about the conditions and constraints faced by migrant workers. This will enable them to forge solidarities and networks with workers' associations in destination locations. Activists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) will be able to use this opportunity to raise their profile and attract positive attention and rewards. 
The project' s academic beneficiaries have already been listed. Alongside, members of the local 'applied research' community will also benefit from the project's data on past and present migration and livelihoods patterns. Relevant analysis from the data will be shared with them, subject to permissions being obtained from the research participants and depending on ESRC guidelines.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder

The group discussions were conducted by researchers at PRAXIS who developed different checklists to work with men in both source (link with file presently under 'Men in Source Locations') and destination (link with file presently under 'Men in destination locations') localities, and women in source (link with file presently under 'Women in destination locations') localities. The source localities included ten rural locations in the State of Bihar.
