&lt;p>&lt;br />&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>HealthTalkOnline [HTO] is believed to be unique in the field of healthcare communication and each one of its 70 modules have great potential to improve the well-being of the population:
- directly through use by patients/carers and the public and 
- indirectly (through use in training health and social care professionals) in improving how services are delivered. 
Beneficiaries thus include: individuals, general publics, professionals and policy makers.

The new proposed section about disorders of consciousness [DOC] will be valuable to families with a relative in such a condition as they are often very isolated and already routinely use the internet in search of information and support. However, it was clear from our original research that some of the sites people find on the web perpetuate myths and misinformation about DOC; others can be misleading simply because they are complicated and confusing for the lay reader; and some aspects of the experience of having a loved one in a vegetative or minimally conscious state are absent from the web altogether and may be difficult to discuss even among family and friends. The proposed development on this new web resource in the context of the HTO website will provide accurate, balanced and accessible information, presented in a clear and engaging way - offering families reassurance that they are not alone, and giving them the impetus or confidence to tackle unresolved issues either alone or by seeking professional help. Good quality information resources could also help families to help the medical team working to make 'best interests' decisions for people in DOCs. The general public, friends and colleagues, can also learn how to support people who have someone in their family in a DOC. 

The site will also be used in education and training of health and social care professionals. A recent survey of teachers in Higher Education in the UK found that HTO summaries and video clips are being used to teach on a wide variety of courses for health professionals and a 'teaching and learning' area of HTO has now been launched. Interview material used in this project will contribute to video montages for use in teaching and professional development. 

In addition, Sue Ziebland and The Health Experiences Research Group which she heads up is working with NICE to inform the development of guidelines and the new Quality Standards through secondments and secondary analyses of the archive of over 2,000 interviews. The analyses on experiences of DOC will feed into this process. Secondary analysis of the interviews on HTO is also being used to help improve service delivery by incorporating trigger films featuring families' experiences into 'experience-based co-design' and 'experience led commissioning'.

The impact of the new section will be supported by the fact that the website is available free on the Internet and advertised via posters and leaflets distributed to GPs and hospital clinics, libraries and information centres in order to maximise access and familiarity. It is recommended by staff at relevant helplines as well as through information prescriptions. Our research partner, the DIPEx charity, is continually optimising the site to further increase Google access and HTO has links from over 500 other sites including NHS Choices and the Cochrane Library. HTO regularly features in the media on lists of the top health websites and is a resource on the BBC website and for BBC radio 4 programmes such as Woman's Hour and Case Notes. Doctors are increasingly being encouraged to recommend reliable websites to their patients and the promotion of 'information prescriptions' for patients means that many more doctors and academics recommend websites; HTO has a reputation as a site that can be trusted because of the values in its design and the way each section is developed based on rigorous social science research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23920</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Shadow Puppet performance by Play of Light theatre company - developed in collaboration with our research and using voices from our research interviews.</gtr:description><gtr:id>896E3431-83D4-4C05-B8AF-3C940F1B47E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Feedback from performances demonstrate that the theatre piece is moving and thought-provoking.

&amp;quot;Very moving. My nephew suffered a catastrophic brain injury a year ago and died in intensive care a week later. At the time I felt we should have persisted. I'm not sure now.&amp;quot; (Physiotherapist)
&amp;quot;So much of these situations is unfathomable and ungraspable, so it is appropriate that it is told through transient light and shadow, which are ungraspable&amp;quot; (Psychotherapist)

At the time of writing (less than two months post launch) the site has had 1,725 unique visitors from 29 different countries, with 10,800 pages of different pages of the site, and we have many invitations to give presentations about the resource all over the UK and internationally (see 'Launch conference').

Headway, the main brain injury charity in the UK have asked to use film from the site, stating that the new resource: 'fills an important gap in current provision and will have a key impact in improving the lives of vegetative and minimally conscious patients and their families'. The Chair of the Royal College of Physicians Guidelines Development Group (Professor Lynne Turner-Stokes) commented that 'The resource is brilliant - a really useful resource for our patients' families and for the clinical staff. It's an invaluable complement to the National Clinical Guidelines that will help health care professionals to deliver the guidelines in practice'; and Professor Derick Wade (a leading neuro-rehab consultant, Oxford Centre for Enablement) stated that: &amp;quot;It is an excellent website and should be THE resource for Health Care professionals, including managers and commissioners, because it covers all aspects and presents most of the possible points of view. It is well laid out and can be read, listened to and looked at in small bits easily.&amp;quot;

Practitioners report that the resource has improved their own understanding and their ability to work with families: 'a fantastic resource for training our staff - especially for staff who are new to the organization - to expose them to what the families may be thinking and to their needs, and what to say and what not to say.' (Sophie Duport, Royal Hospital for Neurodisability); 'I train people on the Mental Capacity Act - frontline Health and Social Care staff - and this is just such a fantastic resource for that. It's very powerful and bring[s] all the concepts that are so hard to put across - make them come alive for people.' (Sue Lee, Director, Empowerment Matters); 'a very very important resource so that they [family members] can understand the process ... and also what to expect when they come into contact with the law around making decisions in the best interests of the patient' (Yogi Amin, Irwin Mitchell Solicitors). 

Family members using the resource report that the factual information is invaluable, that watching the film clips helps 'break down the isolation' and feels 'liberating ('I didn't know I was allowed to even think [that]') and that the site is great to show friends (so they 'got a better sense of what's really going on'). They also report that the resources we have developed are helpful to share with clinicians ('to get that conversation going'). One commented that she had learned more in an afternoon of looking at the website than she had in the year since her relative's injury and family members emphasized that they found the site empowering, and that it (along with the accompanying 'time-line' booklet) helped to give a 'road map' to navigate an extraordinarily difficult situation.


The new online resource has provided support and information to families and practitioners and helped to improve professional-family communication and best interests decision-making (see comments above). 
We have received many requests to give talks/deliver training and to further develop the resource. In addition to the (over two dozen) talks already delivered (and listed in 'Engagement Activities') we have invitations to present talks/training based on our new resource at a dozen events in the near future. These include: presenting to clinicians at the National Rehabilitation Hospital (NRH), Dublin, Ireland; training advocates at Irwin Mitchell, Leeds and contributing Grand Rounds at two hospitals in Brisbane. We have also been asked to present to the 'Centre for Medical Ethics, Professional Practice and Law' at University of Queensland and to the 'Australian Centre for Health Law Research', Brisbane and to be keynote speakers at the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust international conference in 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.healthtalk.org/peoples-experiences/nerves-brain/family-experiences-vegetative-and-minimally-conscious-states</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Undergraduate AHP Interprofessional Teaching - Cardiff School of Healthcare Sciences - 23 Jan 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9D03B06-E659-4565-838D-DE05ACA14F21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop training to Allied Health Professionals (Occupational Therapists and Therapeutic Radiographers), AHP roles - diagnosis and prognosis of VS/MCS, core skills for AHPs, Communication skills, Best Interests, ethics and law.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Working Party (National clinical guidelines) (Published December 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCFD940F-581A-40A7-8666-0B8F739CF532</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The on-going work on the ESRC Knowledge Exchange Project helped contribute to the final stages of developing National Clinical Guidelines.

Several legal practitioners said that they were newly aware of the importance of understanding the families' point of view in relation to Court of Protection cases for a relative. Many said that they would refer family members in future to our healthtalk.org resource for help and support.

This served to increase knowledge and capacity in the area of treatment of vegetative and minimally conscious patients and support for their families, and enabled those present to act as ambassadors for the new online resource in their own advocacy organisations.

There was a particular interest in how Advance Decisions would help improve decision-making for PVS/MCS patients. At their request we subsequently worked with 7 advocates who were part of the audience to provide information and support for them in writing their own Advance Decisions (thereby drawing on expertise developed as part of ESRC grant [ES/J022306/1]). These advocates have since promoted ADs within their own organisations with both staff and clients. Most had known about ADs before the session but nobody present had actually done one. Their decision to complete and promote ADs was strongly influenced by this talk about families' experiences of PVS/MCS. The impact here demonstrates a productive synergy between activities associated with two different awards in which the PIs of both are involved (Celia Kitzinger is PI on ES/J022306/1 and Co-I on ES/K00560X/1; Jenny Kitzinger is PI on ES/K00560X/1 and a fully-participating member of the seminar series funded by ES/J022306/1.)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference, Launch for healthtalk.org module on vegetative and MCS (17 Sept 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32B415C6-2A44-4243-B93F-8FE5E92CA11B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A total of 110 people, mainly health care practitioners, but also a wide range of others such as legal practitioners, attended this launch and were introduced to the online resource we created, listened to panel presentations from leading experts in the field and networked and debated the issues raised. The formal evaluation via feedback sheets demonstrated that the event: (a) increased knowledge and capacity in the area of the treatment of vegetative and minimally conscious patients (e.g. in relation to understanding family perspectives, but also in relation to the law); 
(b) provided support for families and a basis for improved communication with practitioners (c) inspired those present to act as ambassadors for the new online resource in their own professional networks (e.g. legal/medical) and in a wide range of settings (e.g. hospital and long-term care centres). 
Examples of written comments in response to questions about what they had found useful/learnt included:
'Thank you. The most motivating and inspiring project I have seen for a long time. Congratulations. Will disseminate it widely among the neuro team I work in';
'Finding out about this amazing resource and realizing how useful it will be in the training I deliver'; 
'Clarify Mental Capacity Act, will digest the three helpful leaflets and let other clinicians know re this useful website'; 
'will give info to my colleagues and Commissioners in CCGs'; 
 'The resource will be a valuable contribution to the support and information available to our patients' relatives and friends. We will be signposting them to it.';
'The resource will enable me to suggest the patients' families watch the videos and provide a platform on which to explore their thoughts'. 


We were subsequently asked by attendees to run additional sessions in their local regions to help train a wide variety of professionals on the basis of our research findings and the health talk module e.g training Independent Mental Capacity Advocates health service delivery staff across the UK.

The film was made as part of our work on ESRC award reference ES/K00560X/1.

At the same event, and in association with two local supporters of the charity, Compassion in Dying, we also mounted an exhibition and ran a stall for the public which included information about Advance Decisions and offered a sign-up sheet for members of the public who wanted one-on-one appointments at an AD Clinic to assist in writing their own. 

The impact here demonstrates a productive synergy between activities associated with two different awards in which the PIs of both are involved (Celia Kitzinger is PI on ES/J022306/1 and Co-I on ES/K00560X/1; Jenny Kitzinger is PI on ES/K00560X/1 and a fully-participating member of the seminar series funded by ES/J022306/1.)




After the talk there was a surge of interest in the stall about coma and ADs. We were fully occupied for about two hours with conversations with people about coma and ADs. About 50 people took AD templates and 6 made follow-up appointments for further information and help in filling them in. The talk about 'coma' had clearly challenged people's preconceptions and raised concern about end of life choices.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://yornight.com/activities/health/coma-retelling-the-story/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cathy Rezenbrink - Cardiff boktalk - ESRC being human</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA6EEE74-096B-445C-8547-A8A66EA6033A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>16th and 17th Nov 2016&amp;nbsp;we co-hosted&amp;nbsp;public events with Cathy Rentzenbrink to discuss her memoir about her brother's catastrophic brain injury, and eventual death after on of the early UK court cases for treatment withdrawal.

The event included our talk on 'Family experiences of treatment withdrawal: Developing a healthtalk.org resource' and dialogue with key professionals (e.g. Judge Justice Baker). The event generated intense debate and dialogue about recent legal rulings and decision-making about the withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment.

The event as a whole impacted on knowledge: on entry to the conference the delegates' (self-assessed) average knowledge level about the topic was 2.85 on a five-point scale (where 5 was 'very knowledgeable'). Their average exit score was 4.15. 

Respondents highlighted that they had gained: 
'Improved understanding of the role of the patient's family'; 
'Enjoyed learning about insights into perspectives of families and healthcare workers'; 
'Wider discussion of family/carer experience'; 

They reported changes such as:
'Better prepared when representing the family'; 
'referring clients/families to available resources'; 
'raises awareness to be open with families re future decisions even if they don't need to make them in the here and now'; 
'Reassured re. discussion on withdrawing CANH (i.e. having that conversation). I have a case where people are reluctant to have that conversation even though I know it's PVS.' 
'Both in this discrete area and in my practice as a family lawyer I will be more alert to the importance of the insights of non-legal professionals';
'Significantly has inspired me to try and work with CDoC to promote improvements in PVS treatment and court process in Wales'. (Gavin Knox, Solicitor).
Members of the Official Solicitor's office reported that they had learned a great deal from the event and said that they had been impressed by 'overall understanding with a joined-up approach' (Brid Breathnach, Official Solicitor's Office) and that they had learned from 'discussion of family/carer experience, depth of thought. Excellent course. Would very much want to come to more' (Sophia Roper, Official Solicitor's Office).


After this event we had on-going discussions with participants about improving policy and practice across different parts of England and Wales.
Legal colleagues have used our resources to support the families they are working with.
We have also been invited to contribute to a series of subsequent events (e.g. give keynotes and training) to expand learning based on our research e.g a legal firm emailed: &amp;quot;We have been incredibly impressed by the on-line resource created to highlight the many and varied issues faced by relatives who can have to make the most important decisions imaginable on behalf of loved ones. It is for that reason that we would like you to partner us on what we see as a very relevant event aimed predominantly at local clinicians'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://coppagroup.wix.com/coppa#!seminars/galleryPage</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture (Acquired Brain Injury Training Day, Cumbria Partnership, CK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E57FC16-6EC9-438E-B7F7-C099944A51B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introducing the healthtalk.org resource of prolonged disorders of consciousness

This point generated general agreement from colleagues and several said they would use the resource in best interest meetings with diverse patients/families (e.g. the page on 'Resuscitation and DNR').

Speakers were: Verena Hewat (End of Life Rights Project Coordinator, Compassion in Dying), Robert Cole (Head of Clinical Practice, West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust); David Worth (retired Consultant Physician, York Hospital); Paul Murphy (National Clinical Lead for Organ Donation); Penney Lewis (Centre of Medical Law and Ethics, Kings College London), Celia Kitzinger (PI, ESRC Advance Decisions Seminar), Jenny Kitzinger (Co-Director, York-Cardiff Chronic Disorders or Consciousness Research Centre), Sue Wilkinson (Loughborough University researcher with Compassion in Dying Helpline). 

The discussion continued for 45 mins in the lecture theatre and for another hour over drinks afterwards. Several people signed up for the Advance Decision Clinic scheduled for the following day. 

Evaluation of all Before I Die Festival activities was carried out by a Festival administrator and showed significant knowledge gain amongst the audience at this event. On a 5 point scale where 5 = well informed and 1 = not informed at all: 
Before today, how informed were you about issues relating to the topic of this event? 2.54
After todays event how informed are you about issues relating to the topic of this event?; 4.52
Average knowledge gain of nearly 2 points (1.98) on a 5 point scale.

For many people the knowledge gained was personally empowering:
&amp;quot;I am now in a better position to write an AD&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I will make an advance decision and encourage my family members to do so also&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I will consider making an advance decision so my sisters know exactly what I want&amp;quot;

The use (in Jenny Kitzinger's talk) of healthtalk.org video-clips from our ESRC-funded project on Family Experiences of the Vegetative and Minimally Conscious States was particularly commended:

'I found the use of video clips incredibly powerful for conveying the real experiences of people facing these issues thereby giving great importance to the need to make advance decision (which has previously felt very hypothetical and not really relevant to me).'

'Especially enjoyed Jenny's presentation as her videos made the subject 'human' and real by showing us real people who have loved ones in a coma.'

The impact here demonstrates a productive synergy between activities associated with the two different ESRC awards in which the PIs of both are involved. The event was most proximally an outcome of the award on which Celia Kitzinger is PI (ES/J022306/1 and of which Jenny Kitzinger is fully participating member). The success of the event was clearly in part an outcome of the award which enabled the creation of the video-clips in which families describe their experience of PVS/MCS - an award on which Jenny Kitzinger is PI and Celia Kitzinger a Co-I (ES/K00560X/1).

Members of the public said that they would write ADs and many made appointments (via the AD Clinic) for one-on-one meetings with members of the panel for help and information about doing this.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.beforeidiefestival.co.uk/listevents/page/4/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>28th Nov and 1st Dec 2016 We were given permission to live tweet from a court case concerning Paul Briggs - considering continuation/withdrawal of ltreatment.

The interviews (on average around 3 hours each) explored people's experiences of having a son, daughter, sibling, partner, parent or other relative in a vegetative or minimally conscious state. The new video-recorded interviews were added to an already-existing data set of audio-recorded interviews (partially funded by a Wellcome grant) making 65 family interviewees in total. We then translated this research into a multi-media, on-line, support and training resource. We also video-recorded interviews with some practitioners (a brain surgeon, a critical care consultant and two neuro-rehabilitation experts). 

Our findings showed: (a) the isolation and lack of information and support experienced by some families; (b) lack of clarity from some family members about their own role in decision-making and (c) a lack of awareness about the role of the patient's prior expressed wishes, values and beliefs. The research suggested a need for improvements in communication, decision-making processes and compliance with the Mental Capacity Act 2005. Our findings also highlighted some of the complex emotional and social challenges confronted by families, and the lack of accurate cultural representation of prolonged coma-like states.

The on-line resource was developed to address the needs identified and to help families to contribute to decision-making about their relative, backed up by reliable medical and legal information. It was also designed to be of use to practitioners in the field. 

The resource is in the form of a section for the award-winning charity website healthtalk.org.uk - a site which 'provides free, reliable information about health issues, by sharing people's real-life experiences' and covers over 80 different health conditions.

Our new section focuses on family experiences of vegetative and minimally conscious states. Information is presented under 39 topic headings, grouped under key themes (e.g. 'Impact on family', 'Decision-making about medical treatments' etc), Each topic page includes a summary of key issues illustrated with film clips from the interviews (250 clips in total), alongside clinical and legal information. 

This resource provides support for families, a tool to facilitate good clinician-family communication, and information for professional training, clinical guidelines and legal/policy discussion. 

The researchers launched the new resource at a conference for practitioners (see 'Engagement Activities' - 'Launch conference') and subsequently ran training events with hospital ethics committees, neuro-intensive specialists, independent mental capacity advocates, and healthcare practitioners in long-term care centres (See 'Engagement Activities'). Outputs include:
six publications, i.e. the multi-media website which was the core output, and in addition a booklet for families and 4 academic publications; 
the project PI was co-producer on 2 half hour BBC radio programmes 
and we delivered 27 training sessions/talks using the resource (8 of which were invited keynotes). The resource is now widely used across the UK and there is evidence of international interest and use (web-hits have come from 28 countries in addition to the UK and we have given talks in the US and Australia).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In addition to being used by families of vegetative and minimally conscious patients, this resource can be (and is being) used by: (a) academic researchers developing further analysis of the issues from diverse disciplinary perspectives (see work with colleagues from philosophy, history, law etc at www.cdoc.org.uk) and (b) by health care practitioners, including those interested in particular areas of health care for vegetative and minimally conscious patients. For example, with the help of ESRC IAA funding, we are already working with an experienced physiotherapist to develop specific training for physiotherapists working with vegetative and minimally conscious patients and their families, and are planning a collaboration with neuro-psychologists: we hope to take both these projects forward in the future. We have also been approached by a care home concerned to develop better practice specifically for ethnic minority families and clinicians are also keen to develop more resources and expertise related to families' diverse religious and cultural backgrounds.

This resource can also be/is being used as a training resource by/for bioethicists, hospital ethics committees, lawyers, hospital clinicians, and care staff in long-term care settings catering for these patients. We are already working with these groups (see 'Engagement Activities'), and again see a great deal of potential for the future.

This resource, and the research that underpins it, is also informing debate about law and social policy in two domains: 
(1) serious medical decision-making regarding VS/MCS patients; 
(2) uptake and implementation of Advance Decisions - especially through (a) synergy with the Co-investigator, Celia Kitzinger's ESRC award on Advance Decisions (ES/J022306/1) and (b) a commission from Welsh government to advise on how to increase understanding of Advance Decisions in
