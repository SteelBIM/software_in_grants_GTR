The aim is to support and enhance the delivery of impact from this cross-cutting programme of research into terrorism, cyber-security, threats to infrastructure, etc. Focussed effort is needed to a) identify existing projects most likely to deliver value to end-users; b) highlight requirements that are currently unfulfilled; and c) break down barriers between researchers and stakeholders in Government, industry and the third sector.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The first priority is to triage the existing research portfolio, to find a small number of projects where there is the opportunity to deliver substantive benefits. The second priority is to promote greater engagement between stakeholders and researchers, ensuring challenges are better understood, with the opportunity for projects to be co-designed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This role does not require ethical approval to be obtained. Nevertheless, the External Champion will show commitment to the following principles:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>promote the importance of partnership&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>respect the academic quest for knowledge, as a valued end in itself&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>engage with ethical and security concerns of researchers and stakeholders&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>recognise the significance of the GU Programme for stability and well-being&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>focus on a drive to deliver beneficial, practical outcomes from the GU programme&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Dr Riley-Smith believes there are opportunities to extract significant impact from the GU Programme, recognising that focussed effort is needed a) to identify existing projects most likely to deliver value to end-users; b) to highlight end-user requirements that are currently unfulfilled; and c) to break down barriers between researchers and end-users.

His top priority in the first year would be to review the existing research portfolio, running a triage process to highlight a small number of projects - perhaps half a dozen - where there is the opportunity to draw up an enhanced impact plan that would deliver substantive benefits. He believes the External Champion can add value through coaching and support, with an emphasis on building partnerships between researchers and end-users. It is too early to predict where these benefits will materialise from, and when, but Dr Riley-Smith would expect to find good prospects in the portfolios of all Research Councils. 

His second priority will be to promote greater levels of engagement between end-users and researchers, ensuring challenges are better understood, with the opportunity for end-users (from different domains) and researchers (from different disciplines) to co-design projects. The picture is patchy, with some interest-groups insufficiently engaged (eg Law Enforcement Agencies, which should have a strong interest in the GU Programme given the Serious and Organised Crime theme), and with many others suffering from limited &amp;quot;band-width&amp;quot; to support collaborative research. Over the last year, Riley-Smith has identified a number of tools and techniques designed to enhance engagement; he has concluded that these need to be deployed within a connected &amp;quot;eco-system&amp;quot; rather than haphazardly. An early goal will be to review governance arrangements, in case a &amp;quot;Partnership Board&amp;quot; could help stakeholders to work together.

The benefits deriving from his work extend beyond researchers and end-users/stakeholders, to citizens of the United Kingdom and the wider world who benefit from better national and global security outcomes.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>672754</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Digital Catapult Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FEB9195-3926-4FDD-B121-60F9DAE8DD87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication of a Policy Briefing Note (&amp;quot;Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity&amp;quot; and its promotion through a conference at the Digital Catapult and a Working Lunch for policy-makers in the European Commission.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>I worked with the Cybersecurity Lead who helped to plan the Horwood House event, invite participants and co-chair the event.

3. Talks in Brussels and Stockholm (linked to European Parliament and UNDP respectively) in March/April 2016.
4. The Government's Chief Scientific Advisor was complimentary about the quality of the work at a meeting of senior Government Officials. There was a meeting on 11 March 2016 with the Government Office of Science: the meeting with Dr Ferguson lasted c three hours with a detailed review of the paper by individuals conducting a significant internal review of HMG strategic communications; it emerged that they weren't aware of much of the literature covered in our evidence review (having rooted much of their efforts to date on quantitative methods): the introduction of insights from Social Sciences and Humanities would appear to represent an early impact.
5. On 23 March, Dr Ferguson was invited to present her findings to a meeting in the FCO, with representatives of DfID, FCO, RICU, and the British Council present. 
6. International interest was expressed in this work by organisations as varied as the US Department of Defense; USAID; the National Endowment for Democracy (Washington DC); the Norwegian Development Agency; the Swiss Agency for Development; the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Centre; and NGOs Search for Common Ground and Saferworld.
7. In June 2016, Dr Ferguson travelled to Washington DC, giving a lunchtime presentation to staff in the British Embassy then speaking to the CVE (Countering Violent Etremism) task-force in the Department of Homeland Security (who asked her how she would spend a budget of $100,000,000! She then attended the UN General Assembly interactive dialogue on the responsibility to protect.
8. In summer 2016, the Ministry of Defence's Director of Defence Strategy and the Office fir Counter-Extremism in the Home Office asked for copies of the report.

Her work focused on the use of propaganda by a variety of state and non-state actors, and the evidence base behind current counter-propaganda strategies and efforts to combat violent extremism. in the course of a 3 month placement, Dr Ferguson reviewed the evidence of the effectiveness (or otherwise) of strategic communication and the media in countering violent extremism and information warfare.The key output of the placement was a report (published on the PaCCS website and launched in the Houses of Parliament at the All Party Parliamentary Group for Global Uncertainties on 1 March 2016). It was used by BBC Media Action and the Partnership to inform policy thinking and, if appropriate, future research calls in this area.

Key aims of the project were to draw OSCT's attention to significant research that could deliver impact, and to highlight any significant gaps between supply and demand; Dr Glazzard identified and reviewed 191 relevant projects within the Global Uncertainties/PaCCS programme (with an further 20 found through Gateway to Research), linking them to six OSCT S&amp;amp;T research themes (Explosives; Radiological &amp;amp; Nuclear Threats; Biological &amp;amp; Chemical Threats; Emergency Service Response; Border &amp;amp; Aviation Security; &amp;quot;Pursue&amp;quot; (innovative approaches to identifying terrorist threats and activity). The response from the Home Office was remarkable: a letter from the relevant Deputy Director (Ian Gibson) noted that Dr Glazzard's efforts &amp;quot;to map the academic work being undertaken under PaCCS has opened our eyes to a significant volume of work of relevance to our work here. ...

The concept was inspired by Tristram Riley-Smith's desire to ensure that industry has a window into the cyber research world. The database was seeded with data provided by PaCCS to Crossword. Today CLUE covers over 500 cyber security research projects and has in the region of 400 users.

Anna's work (aided by her security vetted status) provided not just the requirements in language that academic and research could immediately digest but also just as importantly the strategic and operational context in which the requirements arose. This clarity of requirement, context and prioritisation offers the best prospect of research yielding practical impact of mutually benefit to the customer and researcher.

I also offered to make introductions if they want to get access to expertise - I urged them to talk to Prof Rob Gleave as a reliable source on the extent to which Mohammed's teachings and Islamic texts promote violence; and I suggested they could learn from the work that Prof Peter Morey is doing to build relationships of trust between different faiths.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Support for Home Office / Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) Science and Technology Briefing Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7C462DFB-C9AC-42E9-A71D-5A68F8A2388B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>(OSCT) held a Briefing &amp;amp; Networking day in July to provide academia &amp;amp; industry with information on three SBRI calls under their Science and Technology Programme. At the event, we delivered an address to participants on the research landscape in the UK, the benefits of collaborative research projects and the role of the Partnership in helping to facilitate these. We also sourced four academic researchers to present their work to participants, highlighting examples of innovative research. We received feedback from all four researchers that these presentations led to follow-up discussions with representatives from government and industry. Following the event, we have been working closely with both OSCT and Innovate UK to ensure the SBRI calls are suitable and appealing for researchers. We have collectively identified potential obstacles to academia engaging effectively with these calls and we are working together to improve the ecosystem for research to deliver impact. (See the blog &amp;quot;Helping researchers break into SBRI calls&amp;quot;: http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/blog/helping-researchers-break-sbri-calls/). 

On 17 February 2016 we were invited into the Home Office, as it prepared for its 2016 S and T programme. Tim Cook in OSCT made a point of thanking us for the contribution made in 2015, noting - in his words - a remarkable jump in quality and quantity of bids for their research funds. There were, for instance, 65 responses to the Digital Forensics; call, with 11 proposals being funded.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appointment to Executive Committee of RUSI's Strategic Hub on Organised Crime</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53CA6638-B81A-4D56-8D0F-2F8089F8DDBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Strategic Hub has been created to improve engagement between academic research into the subject and policy-makers and practitioners.

The workshop was informed by the PaCCS Policy Briefing Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity that I had co-authored with Dr Siraj Shaikh (from the KTN), and both Dr Shaikh and I had the opportunity to refer to the Briefing's findings in the course of discussion.

The workshop was able to shape DCMS thinking about the use of funds to stimulate the formation of early-stage companies, and it led to a national initiative based on the ICURe model developed by the SETsquared Partnership. DCMS subsequently announced a new cyber security programme for Academia designed to progress cutting edge research ideas and support these towards commercial success. The new Cyber Security ICURe Innovation-to-Commercialisation programme, piloted by the SETsquared Partnership and Innovate UK, and funded by DCMS, offered university researchers with commercially-promising cyber security ideas up to &amp;pound;35k to 'get out of the lab' ideas to the marketplace.

The call was over-subscribed, with twelve teams selected from eleven universities; the boot-camp to kick-start the process ran in mid-January 2017. The successful candidates - who have been offered the chance to join the Cybersecurity section of our PaCCS Academic Marketplace - are: Imperial College (GLFuzz: Securing Graphic Drivers); University of Southampton (Provenance for Digital Fabrication (3D Printing); University of Cambridge (Pico Authentication Ltd); Liverpool John Moores (InteraCtive CrYPtograpHic Protocol TEaching and LeaRning); Queen's University Belfast (IoT Security - central and distributed protection); University of Surrey (Password+); University of South Wales (Talbot: A SCADA/ICS Forensics Toolkit); Liverpool Hope University (Secret Sharing for Cloud and the Internet-of-things); Anglia Ruskin (Botprobe); Bournemouth University (Commercialisation of CAIRIS - Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security); University of Northampton (Commercialising the concept of a Corporate Cyber-Immune System); Liverpool John Moores University (Modelling Security Requirements for Businesses in 3D).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.setsquared.co.uk/research-commercialisation/cyber-security-icure-programme</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in conference in Parliament discussion impact of Brexit on policy areas</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15CD7883-ACEB-48D1-A5D8-E8677D335808</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 10 November, I participated in an initiative to promote engagement between academics and Parliament, with the focus on building relationships and discussing the impact of Brexit on key policy areas.

We held round-table discussions which helped to ground the research in everyday experience of people working with and thinking about security challenges. Very positive feedback was received, with participants scoring the event 3.7 out of 4. The results were written up in a PaCCS Policy Briefing, published in 2016; the event also informed the publication of an article in The Conversation UK.

Ripples from this conference continue to spread out. In January 2017, I was invited to the House of Lords to brief Lord Pearson (former UKIP leader) and Alan Craig (leader of the Christian Peoples Alliance), both of whom are developing somewhat anti-Muslim rhetoric. As I sought to address and counter their views, I relied heavily on the outputs from this seminar.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/policy-briefings/religion-contemporary-security/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog to help researchers break into SBRI calls</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>32D01290-6452-4352-825A-1048353F3F75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following our engagement with the Science and Technology Briefing Day organised the the Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism (OSCT) in the Home Office .... we had the opportunity to work closely with both OSCT and Innovate UK to ensure that SBRI (Small Business Research Initiative) calls are suitable and appealing for researchers. We collectively identified potential obstacles to academia engaging effectively with these calls and are working together to improve the ecosystem for research to deliver impact. This was encapsulated in a blog (Helping researchers break into SBRI calls) that featured on the PaCCS website. This will have contributed to awareness-raising.

we have some evidence of the impact this achieved from a meeting with the Home Office on17 February 2016. Tim Cook in the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism made a point of thanking us for the contribution made in 2015, noting - in his words - a remarkable jump in quality and quantity of bids for their research funds. He specifically highlighted Digital Forensics - the focus of our blog - where there were 65 responses (far larger than usual) with 11 proposals being funded.

There was a particular focus this year on detection capabilities. We were allocated a dedicated PaCCS space in the BIS Conference Centre, and organised a programme of presentations to industry by the following university-based teams seeking to commercialise their research: Cardiff University (QMC Instruments Ltd) on terahertz cameras from astronomy used for high-sensitivity security screening and plasma diagnostics; Durham University (School of Engineering &amp;amp; Computing Sciences) on Automatic Object Recognition techniques for threat item detection in CT &amp;amp; X-ray baggage security; Manchester Metropolitan University (Sensing &amp;amp; Imaging Group) on Millimetric Wave and Microwave detection of weapons and explosives; Liverpool University (Nuclear Physics Group) on Portable Gamma Ray Imaging Spectrometer: detecting radioactive materials Newcastle University (Selective Antibodies) See it on the Stick tests to detect CBRNe agents very rapidly displayed as a positive line on a dipstick; Oxford University (Department of Materials) on Percolation Sensors for ultra-sensitive detection of vapour traces of explosives; UCL ((Dept of Medical Physics &amp;amp; Biomedical Engineering) ON Novel solutions for through-barrier material identification and radioactive material detection/mapping.

We were invited to stay on after the Briefing Day had finished, to allow these teams to present again to a cross-section of Government officials and technologists working in the National Security arena, giving individual teams a chance to receive feedback from HMG on the &amp;quot;market&amp;quot; for their technology within Government agencies. (This idea came from the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, after their participation in the launch of the PaCCS Academic Marketplace in March 2015).

There was positive feedback, including a letter of thanks (dated 15 June 2016) received from the Home Office's Director for Prepare, Protect, CT Science and CBRNE in the Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism who wrote: I'm hugely grateful for the effort that yourself and Natalia put in to making the engagement day a success. The sheer numbers that turned out for the event, and the excellent feedback that we have received, once again demonstrated to us the benefit of these pre-procurement dialogues with industry and academia. The role that organisations such as PaCCS have to play in helping us reach out to the security sector in crucial, and my team will continue to look to your support, advice and assistance in facilitating this engagement as we look to deliver a challenging range of innovation calls this year.&amp;quot;

Recently, I have heard from Prof Martin Castell at Oxford that the CEO of Cell Metric, came to visit Oxford after the talk, to discuss commercial collaboration; discussions remain at an early stage. And Dr Toby Breckon (Durham) has reported on a couple of new research contracts and a collaboration with two new manufacturers - developments which he partly ascribes to the exposure gained at this event. We have also heard from Ken Wood of Cardiff's WMC Ltd, who reports that in addition to meeting up with a couple of contacts (made at the event) to discuss general aspects of airport security hardware, they have recently been offered Phase 1 funding for HMG's Future of Aviation Security Solutions call.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University Visit (Oxford)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E136A6C-9D5E-4FE3-BA25-F3C44F4FEF44</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited by Oxford's Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Research to present to research administrators from every school/department from the university on the Global Uncertainties Programme, in order to raise awareness of the opportunities and explain my role as Champion in supporting delivery of research impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University Visit (Queens Belfast)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92B86EED-B5C2-411C-A7D8-6E300AD6CA75</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to meet a cross-section of researchers at the Centre for Secure IT on the Global Uncertainties Programme, in order to raise awareness of the opportunities and explain my role as Champion in supporting delivery of research impacts.

Now, our researchers had the chance to engage with 6th Form pupils, with the emphasis on creating the conditions for the schoolchildren themselves to discuss the issues.

Alex Benham, our first Communications Coordinator, had already proposed the idea of PaCCS conferences for schoolchildren in her Communications Strategy, and an introduction to The Brilliant Club provided access to pupils who could derive the greatest benefit from this initiative. The Brilliant Club is an award winning charity that exists to widen access to universities for pupils from under-represented groups. They recruit, train and place doctoral and postdoctoral researchers in non-selective state schools across the country.
 
Five schools were involved: Bushey Academy (Bushey), Fortismere School (Muswell Hill), Greenshaw High School (Sutton), King Solomon Academy (Marylebone), and St James Catholic High School (Barnet). Each sent about a dozen 6th Formers to our workshop in Camden Town, with the venue generously provided by the Open University. The day was structured around two big questions - &amp;quot;How does religion become entangled with conflict and violence?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Is there anything we can do about it?&amp;quot; Through parallel round-table discussions and plenary feedback sessions, we explored a number of sub-themes: identity and difference; trust &amp;amp; mistrust; insecurity and alienation; closed minds and stereotypes.

Discussion groups were led by: Prof Kate Cooper (Manchester), Zehra Jaffer (Vice-Principal of Skinner's Academy), Dr Tayyeb Mimouni (Exeter), Prof Rob Gleave (Exeter), Prof Peter Mory (UEL), Prof Quassim Cassan (Warwick) and Prof John Wolffe (Open University).

We placed one serious obligation on all the pupils. When they get back to their classrooms, each is to compose one or two paragraphs - to be used in the Personal Statement accompanying university applications - describing what they did and what they gained from the day.That way, the day delivers an enduring legacy.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.paccsresearch.org.uk/blog/paccss-brilliant-club-day/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Uncertainties Impact Conference (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC0027F2-ECA3-4ED9-B0E0-5A3A5BD741E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In March 2014, I convened a conference at Chicheley Hall bringing together academic researchers from the Global Uncertainties Programme and non-academic stakeholders (principally from Government and Industry) to explore challenges and opportunities for researchers in delivering greater impact.

In the first 15 months of my Championship scheme 33 researchers have applied to take part: initial surgeries have been conducted and action plans drawn up.

Subsequently, this has become an &amp;quot;open door&amp;quot;, where researchers involved in security-related research can get in touch seeking help (and where stakeholders keen to connect with research can also receive advice). A key outcome is the introduction, where connections are made between researcher and stakeholder: I made 152 introductions over 22 months (April 2014 - December 2015), and expect the aggregate effect of these over the next decade will be significant. For instance, introducing the Centre for Secure IT (Queen's Belfast) to UKTI could lead to an investment in the Northern Ireland Science Park of c &amp;pound;150m; introducing the Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium (based at Oxford) to Improbable (a gaming company) led to a &amp;pound;5m grant from EPSRC to develop simulation tools to model impacts on critical infrastructure, with Improbable contributing &amp;pound;750,000.

At each location we were meeting with a) cyber security researchers from the institution b) technology transfer/commercialisation teams and c) industry / government / national security representatives. The aim was to run interactive, working sessions with one or two presentations from key individuals (myself included), but the majority of the time wasspent in dialogue, looking for opportunities to learn, collaborate and leverage the relationships. Each of the universities visited was keen to understand what concrete outcomes can be derived from this visit.

Fellow-members of the British delegation included a number of researchers who have received PaCCS funding and others who participated in the PaCCS Policy Workshop on Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity that I organised in November 2015; indeed, it emerged that this mission was inspired by that workshop and the subsequent PaCCS Policy Briefing (that was distributed to the American hosts).

We have achieved this through supporting knowledge exchange. At the simplest level, this has involved &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; linking people together: I made 152 introductions over 22 months (April 2014 - December 2015), and expect the aggregate effect of these over the next decade will be significant; for instance, I introduced the Oxford-based Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium to the gaming company Improbable, with the latter contributing &amp;pound;750,000 to a &amp;pound;5m project awarded by EPSRC to develop new simulation tools; I also introduced the Centre for Secure IT (Queen's Belfast) to UKTI and this - we are told - could lead to an investment in the Northern Ireland Science Park of c &amp;pound;150m. Through a placement into the Home Office's Office of Security and Counter-Terrorism, we have - they tell us - transformed their understanding of what academic research can do to help them; a placement into the National Crime Agency has uncovered requirements for social and behavioural scientific research; and the Evidence Review that we commissioned into Communications and Media Strategies for Countering Violet Extremism; has enlightened policy-makers at home and abroad struggling to respond to the propaganda campaigns of so-called Islamic State.

We developed and implemented a successful Communications Strategy for PaCCS, with a flourishing website - paccsresearch.org.uk (receiving almost 8,000 visits from over 6,000 users in the last quarter of 2016, of which 73% were new visitors) and Twitter feed (@paccsresearch) with over 1,000 followers. This infrastructure continues, having been passed across - with the Communications Officer - to Prof David Galbreath at Bath University.

Our Academic Marketplace has allowed some 40 researchers keen to commercialise their IP to set out their stall, attracting interest from around the world via our website; one member of the Marketplace (Cytora, spun out of Cambridge University) raised &amp;pound;2.5m at the end of 2016; and collaboration with a number of Government Departments (including Home Office and Department for Transport) has seen a number of research-teams gain traction in their efforts to turn science into technological products and services. We can claim to have helped the emergence of a number of new companies from Global Uncertainties Research: CyberOwl, SeeQuestor (which has raised over &amp;pound;5m from investors and won the Innovation Award at HMG's 2017 Security and Policing event) and XPCI Technology (which was awarded almost &amp;pound;100,000 from the Department for Transport, in its Future of Aviation Security Solutions call); and our collaboration with Crossword Cybersecurity led to the creation of the CLUE database, helping a global audience understand the contribution that cybersecurity research in the UK is making to the development of new solutions.

Policy Workshops, backed up by the production of carefully-crafted Policy Briefings, have also proved to deliver valuable impact (especially in terms of illuminating and influencing the judgments of policy- and decision-makers). For instance, the Workshop that I held in November 2015 has led to a Policy Briefing Note addressing Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity was launched in London (the Digital Catapult), Brussels (at the invitation of the EC's Special Adviser on Innovation) and Boston, with evidence that it has shaped policy-making (for instance through DCMS's launch - at the end of 2016 - of a programme to support academic start-ups in cyber-security).. We ran three workshops for the Ministry of Defence linked to the Science and Security programme within PaCCS, and this led to five Policy Briefings on topics as wide-ranging as UAVs, innovation in defence and security, responsible science, open source data and the use of social media in the Armed Services. Meanwhile there were unusual impacts arising from our Workshop and Briefing on religion and contemporary security challenges, ranging from the uplifting experience of working with the Brilliant Club to engage Sixth Formers from deprived schools in the issues, through to being invited to brief the former head of UKIP on the importance of religious literacy in political life!

I have received, in the course of the last few years, a number of testimonials from academic and non-academic stakeholders. The latest (received on 13 March 2017 from Dstl) nicely captures the sentiment of many:

&amp;quot;The Science &amp;amp; Security programme within the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research (PaCCS) was set up with the intent of creating enduring relationships between the social sciences research base and the Defence and Security communities pan-government. As an integrator of research output, and creator of routes to exploitation, Tristram has made highly valued contributions to the success of the programme. He has designed and delivered a series of well-attended events, bringing together academics, policy makers, and representatives of the third and industrial sectors to access research outputs and explore their impact. These exposed participants to a rich seam of knowledge, as well as to perspectives other than their own, informing and challenging thinking. His subsequent leadership of the creation of a number of briefs, distilling the themes emerging from these events into insights for policy makers, are helping ensure that policy development is cognisant of the research front line in areas as diverse as social media, autonomy and the ethics of emerging science and technology. Tristram has also very effectively, and with significant energy, facilitated the building of new relationships between academia and a diverse set of stakeholders, enabling linkages which would otherwise not have been made.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>285DE042-7E26-41C9-B1BA-0BEDC0B120B6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant was focused specifically on the development and delivery of a set of services dedicated to championing RCUK's Global Uncertainties (GU) Programme (subsequently re-branded the Partnership for Conflict, Crime and Security Research or PaCCS). The role is essentially that of a broker, looking for opportunities to support knowledge exchange between academic and non-academic stakeholders in security-related research, in order to promote the delivery of impact.

All the original objectives were met: a) through use of databases and networking, I was able to develop a sound understanding of accredited projects within the programme; b) I was able to provide advice to the Research Councils about significant gaps (in areas of Transnational Organised Crime, for instance, or around techniques for countering violent extremism through communication and media strategies). c) I established a network of personal contacts covering hundreds of individuals in universities, Government Departments, industry and the Third Sector, and this network was augmented through the use of portals (such as Impact Acceleration Account Directors in universities or RISC - the Security and Resilience Industry Suppliers Council) to reach a wider community of interest; d) I spent a lot of time communicating messages about the PaCCS research programme and the needs of non-academic stakeholders through visiting organisations, and this was amplified through the development and implementation of a Communication Strategy that led to a flourishing PaCCS website and Twitter account; e) I made progress in breaking down distrust on both sides, with evidence (from declarations made by the Home Office and Ministry of Defence for instance) that Government was more willing to reach out and engage with academics, and with academics searching for new ways to deliver impact (including through commercialisation of their Intellectual Property); f) I deployed a range of interventions to underpin and accelerate these objectives, including speed-dating Fellowship Schemes, Placements, Policy Workshops and Policy Briefings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work has demonstrated the power of the broker (capable of building trust and credibility on both sides) to enhance the delivery of impact through effective engagement between academic and non-academic stakeholders, with impact taking different forms (intellectual, instrumental, polemical and pedagogical). Strong channels of communication are essential, and it is pleasing to report that the communications infrastructure that I set up is continuing beyond this grant (with a Communications Officer managing website and Twitter). A key conclusion is that focus, momentum and energy needs to be maintained, and RCUK should be encouraged to allocate resources to this championing or brokerage role to all programmes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C695C5ED-DAE7-4364-96E4-FC06A4999D0A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://paccsresearch.createsend1.com/t/ViewEmail/r/300DC422F3F4A92E2540EF23F30FEDED/7D89CE9314F4021DC35B3650D253B2D9</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Attending European Commission Cybersecurity Conference in Vilnius convened by High-Level Group of Scientific Advisers</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>814F8410-A37A-4AC3-84F5-42C511BD542C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://ec.europa.eu/research/sam/index.cfm?pg=cybersecurity#vilnius</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice on Ebola Capabilities in academic community for Civil Contingencies Secretariat</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>93475E8E-53E4-432F-BE98-EC8A21A68AC0</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Home Office Security and Resilience Growth Partnership Ministerial Steering Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C13FFBC8-EC5B-4E4C-8A35-3C314CD9A7E5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Innovation Challenges in Cybersecurity</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0413AD40-74CF-4A8F-A7EF-53A7BED37D14</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CSaP Workshop (July 2015) to support Cabinet Office's Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BFEB5C86-1520-45DE-80C6-359C165735BB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>RISC Council</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7184AD85-13F8-47FB-BC42-320AE06DAAB6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Policy Workshop for Cooperation Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D81FDB4-88B0-4378-926B-62CA837DC81E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We initiated a Policy Workshop held at the University of Durham for the charity Cooperation Ireland, to explore opportunities to reduce risks of radicalisation in marginalised Republican communities; senior representatives of the charity came together with a cross-section of researchers to discuss the challenges and consider options.

In the eighteen months since its creation (on 24 August 2015), this page on PaCCS's website has received a total of 58 visits and 54 unique page-views. Most users spent an average time of 02:48 minutes on the page. The majority of page-views were from the UK (91.38%), followed by the US (6.90%) and Greece (1.72%). During this 18-month period, the page was evenly visited with daily pageviews consistently ranging from 0 to 4 (an average of 0.10 visits per day).

This is a relatively low hit-rate (a similar map showing centres of research excellence of relevance to PaCCS has received almost 400 hits in a similar amount of time).

We conducted a survey of Impact Acceleration Account Directors (and others), and identified 54 teams (located in 24 universities) working on Terrorism, 38 on Transnational Organised Crime, 83 on Threats to Critical Infrastructure, 63 on Conflict, 64 on Cyber-Security, and 45 on CBRNE proliferation. 

In Q1 2015, we expanded our map of centres associated with security-related research through an analysis of the old portfolio of accredited Global Uncertainties projects. This more than doubled the number of universities in the database (from 24 to 57): we identified 67 teams working on terrorism, 55 working on TNOC, 95 on Threats to Critical Infrastructure, 99 on Conflict; 75 on Cyber, and 59 on CBRN proliferation. The universities are: Aberystwyth, Anglia Ruskin, Aston, Bath, Birkbeck, Birmingham, Birmingham City, Bournemouth, Bradford, Bristol, Brunel, Cambridge, Cardiff, City, Cranfield, Derby, Durham, Edinburgh, Exeter, Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, Hull, Imperial, John Hopkins, KCL, Kent, Lancaster, Liverpool, Loughborough, LSE, Manchester, Middlesex, Newcastle, Nottingham, Nottingham Trent, Open University, Oxford, Plymouth, Queen's Belfast, Reading, Royal Holloway, Sheffield, SOAS, Southampton, South Wales, St Andrews, Surrey, Sussex, Swansea, UAL, UCL, UEA, UWS, Warwick, Westminster, Wolverhampton, York.
