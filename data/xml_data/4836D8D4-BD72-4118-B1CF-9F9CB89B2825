Most of our understanding of melatonin biology comes from studies of adult animals, in which melatonin only acts on a restricted number of tissues throughout the body. However, it is known that more tissues in the body are sensitive to melatonin in foetuses and newborns than in adults. To date, the biological significance of the broader sensitivity to melatonin during development is not known. One way in which we can start to explore these undefined roles of melatonin is to gain a clear understanding of the nature of the processes that underlie these developmental changes. This project will build upon recent studies by the applicant and help us to understand how tissues change their sensitivity to melatonin during development. The applicant has recently published multiple research papers investigating the developmental regulation of melatonin sensitivity in gonadotroph cells of the pituitary gland, which is the best-characterised model for studying the developmental biology of melatonin. Pituitary gonadotroph cells are essential for reproduction function, including pubertal development. We have provided preliminary evidence to suggest that the developmental secretion of a brain-derived chemical, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH), is the primary stimulus for decreasing sensitivity to melatonin in gonadotroph cells. Furthermore, the effects of GnRH appear to be mediated by a cellular signalling molecule called Egr-1. The current project will be the first to provide a detailed investigation into the role of GnRH in determining melatonin sensitivity. We will use a range of complementary experimental techniques to manipulate both GnRH and Egr-1 activity and then evaluate the effects of these manipulations on melatonin sensitivity. These techniques will include the use of isolated cells grown in laboratory conditions, in order to minimise the use of animals. The results of this work will have important implications for scientists and the public. On completion of the project, we will have a greater understanding of the biological role of melatonin and, more generally, an insight into developmental changes in hormone-secreting cells. As melatonin is available over-the-counter as a food supplement in some countries, this work will also help us to understand potential health risks of taking melatonin in certain situations e.g. during pregnancy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Although the melatonin receptors are highly regionalised in adult mammals, their expression exhibits a wider distribution in perinatal mammals. This not only suggests novel physiological roles for melatonin during development, but also the presence of as yet undefined mechanisms that modify the physiology of multiple cell types by regulation of their sensitivity to melatonin. The best studied model of perinatal melatonin receptor expression is the neonatal pituitary gonadotroph. Melatonin inhibits gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) induced luteinising hormone (LH) secretion and has been proposed as a regulator of puberty. In recent work, we have undertaken analysis of the MT1 melatonin receptor, which is the predominant subtype in the neuroendocrine system. Promoter analysis identified Pitx-1 and Egr-1 as potent regulators of MT1 gene expression in COS-7 cells. Interestingly, Egr-1 is an early response gene following GnRH stimulation of gonadotroph cells. Moreover, mice lacking GnRH express more pituitary MT1 mRNA. This proposal will use complementary in vivo and in vitro models to directly test the hypothesis that GnRH down-regulates MT1 via Egr-1 induction. By the end of this project, we will have an increased understanding of MT1 promoter regulation, particularly the importance of putative Egr-1 cis-elements. We will be able to compare the expression of MT1 mRNA in mice lacking Egr-1 with mice lacking GnRH. Finally, we will know the effect of reduced GnRH signalling, by both pharmacological and physiological means, on the expression of both Egr-1 and MT1 mRNA. Together, these experiments will provide important advances in our understanding of how neuroendocrine signalling regulates the sensitivity of 'peripheral' endocrine cells to melatonin. The work will therefore have major benefit to both the understanding of melatonin physiology but also the developmental plasticity of neuroendocrine systems.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357608</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Professor David Hazlerigg</gtr:description><gtr:id>F230195B-624B-4ABE-9F13-32D801742452</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Group performed some analyses on tissue samples generated by research conducted within the grant.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Paris Sud</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr Serge Laroche</gtr:description><gtr:id>33C15B67-478B-4F46-AFBD-559E957A4F7C</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Group provided us with some rare materials that aided our research project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Open days - University of Surrey</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>341A6F8D-D5D2-4035-8098-9652A708B144</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students and parents were extremely appreciative of the opportunity to talk to an academic member of staff about undergraduate study, professional training etc

1. Novel scientific findings. We demonstrated for the first time that a key hormone involved in reproduction (gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, GnRH) directly downregulates melatonin receptor expression in pituitary cells that drive reproduction.

2. Model development. Our data, derived from successfully combining in vivo and in vitro approaches, enabled significant development of a model of melatonin receptor expression. For instance, in addition to achievement 1 above, we know that the transcription factor EGR-1 is not necessary for pituitary melatonin receptor regulation.

3. Development of novel collaborations with Dr Serge Laroche (Paris). Through the provision of animal tissue to a collaborating group, I am also now looking to publish collaborative data with the postdoc in that group, who is now a junior PI.

4. Experience of research management. This New Investigator grant threw up a number of issues that have helped me to develop as a PI. For instance, dealing with chronic illness in one of the research team provided a major challenge to research progress that required careful handling in order to ensure a successful outcome to experimental work and also the health of the individual concerned.

5. New technical skills in the laboratory. Completion of the project required successful implementation of experimental methods that were new to me and other members of the team. These included aspects of site-directed mutagenesis and in vivo pharmacology. The experience gained through this work will likely prove to be very useful in my future research.



To what extent were the grant objectives met?

1. Determine whether GnRH decreases MT1 promoter activity via an Egr-1-dependent mechanism in a gonadotroph cell line.
We identified a gonadotroph cell line that endogenously expresses the melatonin receptor subtype of interest. We then successfully showed that GnRH down-regulates melatonin receptor expression in these cells. Further mechanistic insight from this particular cell line was hamoered by the extreme difficulty in transfecting them; indeed, in an attempt to rectify the problem, we out-sourced some of this work to a specialist company that was itself unable to transfect the cells. In the interest of overall project progress, we therefore moved on to other cells and in vivo experiments.

2. Measure the expression of MT1 mRNA in the pituitary of mice lacking a functional Egr-1 gene.
This work involved the establishment of a novel collaboration with Dr Serge Laroche in Paris. We demonstrated that Egr-1 knockout mice have no discernible difference in melatonin receptor expression, contrary to our prediction based on previous work. This finding therefore provided a very useful challenge to our pre-existing model of melatonin receptor regulation.

3. Investigate the effect of in vivo administration of a GnRH antagonist on MT1 expression in gonadotrophs of the adult pituitary.
By incorporating extensive positive controls into our pilot experiment and final work, we demonstrated a clear inhibition of the reproductive system by the antagonist. Nonetheless there was a surprising lack of effect of this drug treatment on pituitary melatonin receptor expression. Again, this novel finding provided a useful challenge to our pre-existing model.

4. Test whether the developmental decline in gonadotroph MT1 expression is caused by pubertal re-activation of the GnRH system.
We successfully established a new hamster breeding colony. For unforeseeable reasons it wasn't possible to complete the main experiment planned under objective 4. However, we did produce tissue samples for analysis by an external collaborator on a parallel project. These data are currently unpublished, but a manuscript is in preparation.

5. Additional work. In addition to the main 4 objectives described above, the postdoctoral researcher and I conducted some collaborative experiments on another Surrey project investigating circadian physiology in vivo. These data are currently unpublished , but a major manuscript is in preparation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>How might the findings be taken forward and by whom?

This project resulted in a number of 'negative results'. However there are a number of outstanding lines of research that could be followed up. Perhaps the most obvious is to understand the novel signalling pathways linking GnRH signalling to melatonin receptor regulation in gonadotroph cells. It would also be useful to understand why blockade of GnRH signalling in adulthood does not result in re-emergence of melatonin receptor expression. Understanding this may provide exciting new insights into developmental programming of gene expression that has impact in multiple tissues throughout the body.

There are a number of pharmaceutical companies interested in melatonin pharmacology. They might be interested in pursuing this work both to identify possible new therapeutic indications and also understand potential side-effects of their drugs. There is also an active melatonin research community in which many individuals have active research interests in the role of melatonin in reproduction and development. Indeed, my work in this area has been cited by paediatricians as well as basic scientists. On the basis of research recently published from this grant, I have been invited to speak at a prestigious FASEB conference in Portugal in 2015.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9178FB6D-8248-45C0-A755-9F6DE6738C1E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>During the project, we produced new DNA molecules that can be used by ourselves and other researchers to study gene activation.
