&lt;p>This Indo-European network will build infra-structure and create a system of science culture indicators based on news analysis and on attitude measures and compare the cultural presence of science in the public debate. Trends in science news (1990-2010; intensity, positioning, issues) are linked to trends in public attitudes to science (interest, attitude, knowledge, engagement: using Eurobarometer and NCAER national surveys, 1989-2010). The network of researchers from UK, Germany and India will mobilise and develop expertise in discourse analysis, computer-assisted text analysis, large scale survey research, sophisticated statistical techniques, and qualitative case study work to track the cultural authority of science comparatively. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Not Applicable</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>108988</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stellenbosch University workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BBC0CD15-4373-4EEC-97D5-EB624A2D5E7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an additional day of public engagement.

OECD Blue SKY Thinking Papers on indicators of 'science culture' 
Martin Bauer had been invited by the OECD working group ST&amp;amp;I indicators, twice before, once in Paris (March 2014) and another time in Tokyo (Oct 2015) to present the MACAS ideas on science culture indicators. In September 2016, the OECD organised the Blue Sky thinking meeting on ST&amp;amp;I indicators in Ghent, and they asked me to organise a symposium on indicators of science culture. The MACAS team presented two papers contributing to the discussions: first, a paper on mass media mapping to create cultural indicators from news reference to ST&amp;amp;I (Suerdem &amp;amp; Bauer, 2016); second, a paper on mapping the cultures of science across Europe (Bauer &amp;amp; Suerdem, 2016). In the latter we developed a new analytical procedure to deal with repeated cross-sectional data on public perceptions of science as this is available in Eurobarometer (six waves. 1989-2013). We examined the data with 'data mining' techniques, combining missing data analysis, imputations, IRT, EFA and CFA to test a 3D model of science culture comprising the dimensions, knowledge, evaluation and engagement. Consistent with previous observations the evaluation of science splits into two sub-dimensions, utility oriented Progress, and value-based Reserves. On the basis of this stabilised system of indicators, we are able to cluster European countries into Four Culture of Science. Currently we are extending this analysis to regional level analysis and hope to be able to classify European regions along a similar number of clusters. 
This analysis of existing data, having curated the EB data base for our purposes, is variously significant. Theoretically, we are revisiting and revitalising older model of Triarchical attitude structures. For a characterisation of science culture, this basic MACAS 3D+ model is very useful and can be put to test on a global scale. Empirically, we are moving away from performance comparisons to structural comparison of 'science culture'. The comparison is no longer at the level any indicator, but on the correlations between the indicators for each culture unit. This constitutes a new way of looking at things. It demonstrates, that the public understanding of science needs to be looked at in the light of a set of model, one shoe does not fit all. The question will be: how many models do we need on a global scale, and what are the boundary conditions for each of them? Thirdly, for the OCED, this idea of culture indicators is new territory because it suggest to use 'subjective data' for ST&amp;amp;I indicators. Hitherto, these OECD indicators are entirely based on performance data (x doing y), while our suggestions are putting mood and atmosphere indicators into the centre of an innovation culture. Clearly, this created interesting discussions with economists. This work will continue in all three directions. Project MACAS has secured a book contract with Routledge Series, Science, Technology and Society, to be published in 2018.

2 Examining the culture of science simultaneously across EU, India and China
Project MACAS has curated three cross-sectional and in some cases repeated cross-sectional data on the public understanding of science across Europe, India and China. While India was a funded partner, the Chinese colleagues became affiliated partners. Successful training sessions and exchanges of young research between the teams took place over the past four years. 
The purpose of this all was to co-ordinate the analysis of all data into a similar logic and conceptualisation, as we have been developing for the OCED discussions. Data mining was applied on India and China data, including missing data analysis, imputations, IRT, EFA and CFA to stabilise the MACAS 3D+ model comprising indicators of knowledge, evaluation and engagement. It was possible to stabilise the fit this 3D+ model on all the data, which seems to suggest that indeed the triarchical attitude structure is universally portable and adequate for the data. Where the cultural element is clearly manifest is in the correlations between these three dimensions, and the clusters that emerge across the provinces. For this analysis, we treat Indian and Chinese provinces in the same way as we treat European countries. 
Our approach is from the start culturally sensitive. Rather a strict model of measurement equivalence, we are relaxing this condition to configural and weak equivalence only, so that we can examine the correlations among the dimensions as our key cultural indicators. The fitting process separately in the three cultural contexts, and we are comparing the resulting correlation structures and cluster the provinces on these. The analysis reveals a set of 'science cultures', four in Europe, two in India, and Five in China (preliminary), which can be characterised by the particular correlations patterns. In line with our working principle, we are not comparing cultures on performance, but on patters of variables. 
This idea and procedure of handling data has been taken up by a new research unit in China, NAIS (National Academy of Innovation Strategy). Project MACAS will continue in China creating an All China index of science culture. These efforts demonstrate that the public understanding of science needs a several models; one shoe does not fit all. The question will be: how many models are needed on a global scale, and what are the boundary conditions for each of them?

3. Construction of media corpus of science news and an integrated database on perceptions 
We started work from previous research, the British Science News Corpus, 1946-1995 (Bauer et al, 1995). The idea of project MACAS, module 2 media mapping, was to update this database to the present (up to 2015). The initial Science News corpus was manually collected and hand coded following classical content analysis. The challenge of project MACAS was to establish continuity in the database, but with entirely different updated technical means of corpus constructions: on-line text scraping, keyword selection, and dictionary based text classification as in computer-assisted content analysis. The technological progress in this area is enormous, in particular the bottle neck on data is removed, however to create equivalences between manual and machines selection, and between human and machine coding is a complicated affair and very time consuming. Project MACAS gave us a very clear idea of what is involved in doing such text-based research. 
Project MACAS developed a comparable strategy for news selection applicable in Indian, German and British newspapers. This took into account the available new on-line sources and constructed a stratified sampling rationale based on a systematic sampling of a two random week (15 random days per year) over the period for a considered set of newspapers in each context. We down loaded the news texts, and adapted it to the format for software QDA Miner. We constructed dictionaries with comparable features in all three contexts and conducted classification of news into themes, actors, scientific disciplines (OECD categories) and geographical locations of news events. On the basis of this we can characterise the science news flow over time and in comparison. KW searches also allows us to construct smaller sub-corpora on specific topics for more fine-grained analysis of themes. All corpora a fully operative in QDA Miner and ready for further research.

4 Examine new techniques of 'computerised text analysis, topic modelling; examining the limits of these techniques with regard to HOTIs
One of the main purposes of this project MACAS was knowledge transfer and training of colleagues and young researchers. Project MACAS has done very successful work in that direction. A multi-national team of researchers is now fully trained on computerised text analysis, including corpus construction from on-line sources, dictionary extraction, topic modelling and difficulties of analysing HOTIs [higher order text intuitions such as narrative, rhetorical features, discourse, frames]. We have examined several software packages for this purpose including ALCESTE and QDA Miner, and also R. 
Project MACAS also organised the technology transfer of a prototype science news monitoring system from Brazil to Turkey, UK and Italy. Project SAPO, developed at the University of Campinas by the Brazilian partners was introduced to project members. The idea was then adapted and implemented in parallel projects in Turkey (Bilgi University, Ahmet Suredem) and at Universith of Padua (Neresini et al). These systems are up and running, and have potential for commercial exploitation. 
Project MACAS has organised a series of training session on computerised corpus construction and text analysis in London, Delhi, Stellenbosch, Istanbul and Salvador in Brazil. The international team and affiliates met three times for workshops in Istanbul (Bilgi University) with invited experts on text analysis for training purposes and exchange of ideas and experiences. Ideas developed for project MACAS also went into a book publication on foundational texts of text analysis in the social sciences.
