the US, in Europe and in the UK. In particular, CVD caused 40% of all deaths in the United Kingdom in 2002 with an overall
CVD cost to the EU economy of almost &amp;pound;166 billion and the US economy $297.7 billion per year. In the UK, the socioeconomic
costs have been estimated to be &amp;pound;29.1 billion in 2004. Since 1990, the number of prescriptions for antiplatelet
drugs for atherosclerosis treatment has increased steadily to over 38 million prescriptions in England every year. The
number of prescriptions for lipid lowering drugs is more than fifteen times higher than a decade ago. In 2011
antihypertensive drugs were the most prescribed drugs for CVD in England, Scotland and Wales. The cost of prescriptions
for hypertension and heart failure therapy totalled to just over &amp;pound;330 million between 2010 and 2011. Better imaging based
atherosclerosis risk stratification could result in a better personalized understanding of risk, and in significant cost
reductions due to the avoidance of unnecessary prescriptions. Patients would directly benefit from an individually stratified
treatment strategy allowing optimal selection for surveillance, medical or surgical treatment.
The benefit to the UK economy beyond healthcare economics will be twofold. Firstly, the project will employ additional staff
in the UK through the academic partner. Philips staff will be working on the project based in the UK, contributing to tax
income. Secondly, revenue streams are expected to Philips UK companies leading to taxable profits. Philips has a strong
presence in the UK healthcare sector and additional sales of a newly developed package as described in this project will
lead to an increase in the profits of Philips UK business. Licensing of IP generated during the project from KCL to Philips
will generate additional revenue streams for KCL. Philips and KCL collaborate the framework of a hub strategy which
integrates industrial software development with academic research centres on-site for short clinical feedback loops. The
proposed project strengthens the KCL imaging research hub and attracts R&amp;amp;D investment of a global company to the UK.
The joint spin-off company that could be founded as UK LC after successful completion of the project would generate
revenues on a case-based business model (see appendix A of the application for details). Revenues from sales of
technology developed during the project are expected already immediately after completion of the project on a small scale
by targeting research customers. The full business potential including a reimbursement scenario can be leveraged
following successful outcome trials subsequent to this project. We will establish a link with the King's Imaging Technology
Evaluation Centre (KITEC), which supports the work of the Medical Technologies Evaluation Programme (MTEP) and the
Diagnostic Assessment Programme (DAP) of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Projects
undertaken by KITEC include randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, establishment of registers and databases.
The scientific methodology results from this research will be output as research publications in high-impact journals in the
field of medical imaging. Target journals will include Circulation, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Magnetic
Resonance in Medicine and Journal of Cardiovascular MR. Dissemination will also take place through presentations at the
major international conferences, especially the American Heart Association, the International Society for Magnetic
Resonance in Medicine (ISMRM) and The Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (SCMR).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>309709</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Maastricht (UM)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>PARISk consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8BBA501-6716-45DD-8591-AABA0419826D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far there no outcomes yet but we will use the imaging data to validate our own imaging findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We have access to magnetic resonance imaging data of patients with carotid artery plaque that have been annotated based on results of previous studies where histology served as the goldstandard.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are validating plaque classification and vessel border detection algorithms developed in this project with the annotated data provided by the partners in Maastricht and Rotterdam.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Medical Center Rotterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>PARISk consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>B9FE25E1-B167-4827-83E1-284626B7E17A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far there no outcomes yet but we will use the imaging data to validate our own imaging findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>We have access to magnetic resonance imaging data of patients with carotid artery plaque that have been annotated based on results of previous studies where histology served as the goldstandard.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are validating plaque classification and vessel border detection algorithms developed in this project with the annotated data provided by the partners in Maastricht and Rotterdam.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Hospitals</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>99950</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

The centreline in combination with quantitative blood flow data can be used to calculate the pulse wave velocity, which is a measure of arterial stiffness. The software also allows to output results in a data format that can be used to perform 1D computational modelling of blood flow. Segmentation of the vessel wall is also possible and aids the characterisation of the vessel wall and help assigning different tissue properties.

The software will allow to assess e.g. vascular stiffness and perform vessel wall tissue characterization and thus will be a resource for academics working in this field and benefit clinicians that treat patients with vascular diseases. Our implementation will also help researchers focusing on computational modelling as we output results in a fashion so that they can be further processed fro 1D and 3D blood flow modelling. The software has been demonstrated at the RSNA 2016 by Philips Healthcare.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>23AC616C-5B87-453D-BE0A-3003889BDCB8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9EE19287-54E1-4096-BD9C-A36ABE4B4DEA"><gtr:id>9EE19287-54E1-4096-BD9C-A36ABE4B4DEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>An Integrated Software Application for Non-invasive Assessment of Local Aortic Haemodynamic Parameters</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Procedia Computer Science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e910b94c4689203be064b89fe119eb71"><gtr:id>e910b94c4689203be064b89fe119eb71</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Florkow M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5447C302-CB13-4FE7-BB3F-8E2953DB5FD0"><gtr:id>5447C302-CB13-4FE7-BB3F-8E2953DB5FD0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aortic length measurements for pulse wave velocity calculation: manual 2D vs automated 3D centreline extraction.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of cardiovascular magnetic resonance : official journal of the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/019bfb30b0cdec9868f88c37f8cab89f"><gtr:id>019bfb30b0cdec9868f88c37f8cab89f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Engelen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1097-6647</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A6885851-9351-42A1-9062-9C7526EFBEA9"><gtr:id>A6885851-9351-42A1-9062-9C7526EFBEA9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Aortic centreline tracking for PWV measurements in multiple MRI sequences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fded0c650760ec12eacc6f6ad5775b7e"><gtr:id>fded0c650760ec12eacc6f6ad5775b7e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>vanEngelen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4F1F6F37-9E45-4987-9BC3-5B3654BFE540"><gtr:id>4F1F6F37-9E45-4987-9BC3-5B3654BFE540</gtr:id><gtr:title>Automatic coronary centerline tracking from coronary MRI</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/019bfb30b0cdec9868f88c37f8cab89f"><gtr:id>019bfb30b0cdec9868f88c37f8cab89f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>van Engelen A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L505304/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
