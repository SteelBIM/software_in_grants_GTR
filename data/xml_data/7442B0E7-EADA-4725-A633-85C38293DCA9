Unsafe abortion is the most easily prevented cause of maternal death. Post-abortion care (PAC) is a strategy to address the problem of the outcomes of unsafe abortion.This research aims to establish how investment in safe abortion services impacts on the socio-economic conditions of women and their households, and the implications for policy-making and service provision in Zambia.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The microeconomic impact of out-of-pocket health expenditure for&amp;nbsp; reproductive health and abortion care, have received little attention.The data available for sub-Saharan Africa are particularly scanty and poor quality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The approach is multi-disciplinary, with primary data collection of both qualitative and quantitative data, including a quantitative survey and in-depth qualitative interviews with women who have sought PAC, and policymaker interviews.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Zambia's relatively liberal legal context, and the existence of PAC provision facilitates research on issues related to abortion which can have broader lessons for developments elsewhere in the region.The majority of women seeking abortion-related care in Zambia do so for PAC following an unsafe abortion, and have not accessed safe abortion services.This demands better understanding and analysis.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>256725</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ohio State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conceptual framework for understanding trajectories to safe or unsafe abortion</gtr:description><gtr:id>68D15677-F454-45A0-B106-469A004C4941</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/58107/</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing and writing of plenary presentation at IUSSP workshop, IUSSP working paper, and currently, a full paper for submission to peer-previewed journal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Developing a conceptual framework for the study of induced abortion</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Guttmacher Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conceptual framework for understanding trajectories to safe or unsafe abortion</gtr:description><gtr:id>43428874-C080-465B-B4D7-371B57411D9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/58107/</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing and writing of plenary presentation at IUSSP workshop, IUSSP working paper, and currently, a full paper for submission to peer-previewed journal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Developing a conceptual framework for the study of induced abortion</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Understanding conscientious objection to abortion in Zambia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97BDA807-0923-46F5-B7C4-028C9034EF6B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Freeman, E., E.

During the meeting, the current activities and debates of the national Technical Working Group (TWG) of Adolescent Health, of which the Adolescent Health Liaison Officer is a member, was discussed. This TWG, comprised of government (e.g. Ministries of Health and Community Development and Mother and Child Health) and non-government (e.g. UNICEF) stakeholders has a very strong influence in setting the sexual and reproductive health agenda for young people in Zambia and is currently revising the national 20114-2015 Adolescent Health Strategic Plan. Having our research presented at the TWG monthly meeting would allow participants in that meeting to use it to shape the agenda and inform their decision making. Subsequently, following the UNICEF Officer's request, the research team produced a PowerPoint presentation of the research findings, situated within targeted analyses of the publically-available Zambian Demographic and Health Survey data for delivery at the next national TWG meeting. These were presented at the meeting by the UNICEF Officer.

It was attended by internal and external academics and those working outside of academia - including alumni. Dr Ernestina Coast (PI) presented work on the role of induced abortion in fertility transitions and the team presented a poster detailing both the research study and impact maximisation elements of this work on unsafe abortion in Zambia. Both sparked discussion of the work.

- The first national estimates of the health system costs of abortion in Zambia, showing that unsafe abortion costs the Zambian health system up to $2.4 million more than if the pregnancies has been terminated safely and legally.
- Detailed description of the influences and pathways to seeking an abortion, highlighting: the roles played by men; the importance of knowing someone who works for the health sector; low levels of knowledge about the legality of abortion in Zambia; and, the risks that women will take in order to terminate an unsustainable pregnancy.
- Analyses of the determinants and economic consequences of abortion care-seeking reveal: Younger women are more likely to seek an unsafe abortion than older women; poorer women are more likely to seek an unsafe abortion, even though the costs of unsafe abortion for individual women are 27% higher than the costs associated with a safe abortion; the low levels of effective contraceptive access and use, particularly for adolescents and postpartum women.
In sum, the research shows that Zambia is not yet realising the substantial investment (legal and health services) it has made in safe abortion. 

To date, 1 article is under review (Global Public Health), 2 are fully drafted (for Social Science &amp;amp; Medicine and Health, Policy &amp;amp; Planning) and a further 7 are in preparation. Research has been presented at a range of events with diverse audiences, including by invitation (Oxford University, IPPF), at international conferences and workshops (IUSSP, PAA), and in Zambia to policymakers, practitioners and journalists. Participation in international fora have led to a new research collaboration with American academics to develop a conceptual framework for the study of trajectories to abortion (in preparation).

Methodological innovation
The study used an innovative mixed methods interview which combined quantitative and qualitative techniques in one interview. This technique allowed us to capture both the individual fine-grained narratives, which are not easily captured in a questionnaire-type survey, especially on such a sensitive area, as well as survey data. Rather than conducting an in-depth qualitative interview and a survey, our method reduced the burden on the respondent, avoiding repetition of questions and reducing the time taken.

Considerable efforts were made to conduct qualitative longitudinal interviews, a novel technique in the study of abortion in low income countries. Despite multiple attempts to re-interview women (all of whom had given permission to be re-contacted), just three (out of a possible 104) re-interviews were achieved. These three interviews yielded high quality and additional information, and added additional insight to understanding women's abortion trajectories.
