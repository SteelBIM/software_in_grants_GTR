An Ethnographic Assessment of Communication Environments in Disaster Recovery and Humanitarian Intervention</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M001288/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project aims to assess the uses and consequences of communication technologies in the disaster recovery from Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded with over 6000 casualties and more than 12 million people affected.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research investigates the uses of digital technologies and innovations such as mobile phones, SMS, crisis mapping and social media both by directly affected populations in the Philippines and humanitarian organisations. Despite the optimism surrounding the uses of digital technologies by disaster-prone communities in processes of recovery and rebuilding there is little evidence to assess the impact of digital platforms for humanitarian relief.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The present study aims to weigh the optimism surrounding so-called ?humanitarian technology? against actual benefits to users. It specifically examines the impact of communication technologies in the following critical areas:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>information dissemination&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>collective problem-solving&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>redistribution of resources&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>accountability and transparency of humanitarian efforts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>voice and empowerment of affected populations. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This 18-month ethnographic study takes place in two disaster-affected locations in the Visayas region of the Philippines. This is a mixed-method project combining qualitative interviews, participant observation and online ethnography both with affected populations and representatives from humanitarian organisations, government agencies and digital practitioners.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project has a clear societal and economic impact for a number of beneficiaries including humanitarian organisations and practitioners in communication for development, government and civil society agencies, the telecommunications industry, software designers and at-risk populations themselves, as discussed below:

1) NGOs and humanitarian organisations dealing with disaster management and development: 
There is surprisingly little evidence for the actual and potential uses of digital media for disaster mitigation and rehabilitation. Our project aims to inform policy directions and strategies of NGOs and humanitarian organizations to improve their interventions. Our partnership with UNOCHA (United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Action) indicates great interest from one of the largest humanitarian organizations to integrate their disaster management operations to the digital environment and learn new ways to interact with vulnerable populations (see letter of support). 
2) Practitioners in the field of communication for development (including ICT4D):
Our findings are also relevant for practitioners in the field of communication for development as they also require evidence on the consequences of ICTs for improving life chances and human capabilities as well as for increasing the voice and visibility of disadvantaged groups. 
3) Government agencies and policymakers:
Public officials in the Philippines, neighbouring disaster-prone regions and developed countries all need better understanding of the potential of communication technologies to develop evidence-based policies. In preparing this proposal we have consulted our partner government agencies (Department of Social Welfare and Development), lawmakers (Senator Loren Legarda, Climate Change Commissioner Yeb Sano) and government advisers (Dr Tony La Vina) and will work with them to ensure our research findings lead to clear policy recommendations. 
4) Telecommunications industry:
Private telecoms companies are at the forefront of communication innovations for disaster response. Government agencies and NGOs often seek the support of telecoms firms during disaster, thus requiring them to critically monitor and evaluate initiatives they are invited to support, as our partner SMART Telecoms relates to us (see letter of support). Philippine telecommunications companies have dedicated disaster response departments and design products to deploy during crises. Our in depth approach will be able to critically assess the difference communication technologies make in disaster response. Such insight can be applied in other disaster-affected empirical contexts. 
5) Digital media designers and software developers:
Recent years have seen a proliferation of digital platforms employed in crisis situations, and often require the volunteerism of both expert engineers and ordinary people from around the world responding to a local crisis. These new digital apps and techniques of crowdsourcing are increasingly used by humanitarian workers when planning/distributing aid, including by UNOCHA. In-depth knowledge of whether these new software and applications have direct impact on vulnerable populations can improve the design of future products commissioned by humanitarian organisations or industry players.
6) Affected populations themselves:
We are committed to sharing our data with local populations who are not understood as passive victims but as active agents in the recovery phase. There is great potential in this research to empower affected populations to make informed decisions, coordinate recovery efforts and make their voices heard in the rebuilding process.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-19</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Online Article: 'A year after Typhoon Haiyan, poor Filipinos find a voice'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F62DDA5D-0426-482F-9DB8-327C08BB900E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article generated discussion online and offline.

Some of the questions addressed include: how are old and new platforms used by affected communities to make their voices heard and increase their visibility? Do new communication technologies increase the transparency of relief efforts and do they improve the accountability of humanitarian agencies? Do new communication technologies empower local communities or do they create new dependencies and inequalities?

Our workshop was attended by representatives from humanitarian agencies and academics who discussed the opportunities as well as risks that new communication technologies pose in disaster recovery. The team members were joined by John Borton (Overseas Development Institute), Dr. Monica Krause (Sociology, Goldsmiths) and Barb Wigley (World Food Programme) who offered responses to the project's findings.

All reports are listed in the 'Influence of Policy and Practice Section'. Our research has also been quoted in several online articles authored by practitioners such as humanitarian consultants. Finally, our research has also been featured in news outlets such as the Guardian, Rappler (Philippines) and SBS (Australia). 


Dr. Madianou and Dr. Ong have been invited by Humanitarian Organisations and Aid Donors (such as DfID) to contribute to panel discussions on Humanitarian Accountability and Communicating with Affected People initiatives. Team members have also invited to contribute online articles for Humanitarian Organisations and think tanks such as CDAC and IRIN (please refer to our engagement activities). These contributions have led to further requests for involvement, collaboration and advisory roles. 

As a result of work from Humanitarian Technologies Project, Jonathan Ong was hired as a consultant of Plan International, World Vision and the International Organization for Migration, where he was a lead researcher for the Accountability Common Services project in the Typhoon Haiyan Response. The two research reports (&amp;quot;Who's Listening&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Obliged to Be Grateful&amp;quot;) are linked to a policy initiative on &amp;quot;community engagement&amp;quot; for the 2016 World Humanitarian Summit headed by Alex Jacobs of Plan International.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F5002905-AA2D-421E-A512-84F7524ADF34</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The 'Humanitarian Technologies Project' was an 18-month study of the uses of social and mobile media in humanitarian relief and disaster recovery focusing in particular on the recovery from Typhoon Haiyan, which hit the central Philippines in November 2013. This is the first study which brings together an ethnography of disaster-affected people and research with humanitarian agencies and other stakeholders in order to understand communication technologies as integral to disaster recovery. 

Our study found that communication technologies do not give people a 'voice'. Technologies can facilitate voice but only as long as other factors, such as social capital and a strong civil society, are present. Further, we identify a divide among the better-off participants who are most likely to have a 'voice' in post-disaster contexts and the poorer participants who report limited participation opportunities (Madianou, Longboan and Ong, 2015). 

Rather than creating a 'level playing field' new communication technologies can exacerbate social inequalities by heightening the life chances for the better off, whilst leaving poorer participants behind. The deepening of social inequalities can compound the effects of the original calamity creating a 'second order disaster' (Madianou, 2015). 

We found that much of our participants' mediated communication resembles an 'echo chamber' and not a dialogue. Participants are likely to share their views with their peers but not with representatives from aid or government agencies. As much as this mediated voice has value, it cannot correct any power asymmetries in humanitarian action. 

Because of the existing technological infrastructure in the Philippines, Haiyan was widely seen as an ideal laboratory to pilot initiatives on accountability to affected communities and thus represents the most systematic implementation of accountability initiatives by humanitarian agencies. Several agencies interpreted accountability as feedback and set up mechanisms for affected people to offer their views and express their concerns. Interactive digital technologies were often prioritised as feedback collection tools. 

Despite the good intentions, the intensification of feedback mechanisms and metrics through digital technologies do not necessarily improve humanitarian action nor do they automatically make humanitarian organisations more accountable to beneficiaries. On the contrary, we discovered that systematic questioning of beneficiaries without closing the feedback loop can disenfranchise affected people and diminish trust of humanitarian agencies (Madianou, Ong, Longboan and Cornelio, 2016). 

Although communication technologies do not fulfil the expectations of voice and accountability they were firmly embedded in the everyday lives of our participants. Mobile phones and social networking sites were widely used for sociality and entertainment while platforms introduced by aid agencies to facilitate information dissemination were often appropriated differently by affected people. We view media's everyday uses in the face of extraordinary events as meaningful coping mechanisms and ways of reintroducing normality in everyday life in the aftermath of disaster. Whilst not fulfilling the expectations of 'humanitarian technology', the uses of social and mobile media for sociality and recreation are vital for our participants' well-being. Yet, we remain aware that the ordinary uses of communication technologies, despite their social significance, do not achieve the redistribution of resources which is vital in the aftermath of disasters. 

Please refer to our Executive Summary for a more comprehensive overview of findings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Throughout the project we worked closely with the following stakeholders: 1) humanitarian organizations, 2) practitioners in communication for development, 3) government agencies and policymakers, 4) telecommunications industry, 5) designers and software developers, and 6) disaster-affected populations.

In our publications, reports and stakeholder events we make the following recommendations: 

We recommend that humanitarian agencies develop a 'culture of listening' extending beyond feedback tools. Digital technologies facilitate feedback collection but can only work alongside an understanding of local cultural and social contexts. Aid agencies need to recognize local norms and structural limitations that inhibit people's participation. Cultures of listening cultivate the participation of communities by developing relationships based on respect and trust.

Community organisers are important intermediaries for affected people, helping to amplify their voice by involving them in decision-making processes. Identifying, training and involving local people, including leaders, can enhance the delivery of relief programmes. 

Within the humanitarian sector, agencies are encouraged to develop ways to address communication obstacles between teams in the organisational hierarchy. Inter-agency coordination is also vital. 

Investing in digital literacy (a long-term project) is essential for addressing the problem of digital inequality.

Ethnography is ideal for understanding complex situations such as disasters.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F9B4FB92-F196-4CC2-AD80-2EA590697625</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://humanitariantechnologies.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>citation in ODI report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAB51ED4-EDEA-4130-A54B-2D021ECA4108</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Overseas Development Institute review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD743FFB-C9B5-4810-B8D6-3C68305F2E00</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.odi.org/events/4211-aap-communication-haiyan-philippines-ebola</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in CDAC (Communication with Disaster Affected People) review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FE224529-33EC-44C4-8111-84EC09B83A82</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cdacnetwork.org/tools-and-resources/i/20141124131123-z7io0</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Plan, World Vision and IOM report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C375442-9B8A-40A1-A703-DD6000F5913B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.alnap.org/resource/20632</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E5010CDA-7E10-46FA-B174-BB958DD322E2"><gtr:id>E5010CDA-7E10-46FA-B174-BB958DD322E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Taking the Square: Mediated Dissent and Occupations of Public Space.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/56f7195019a176ba49dcf26036f46139"><gtr:id>56f7195019a176ba49dcf26036f46139</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Curato, N.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/848C10B6-014A-4972-93EB-BBE45D42A00C"><gtr:id>848C10B6-014A-4972-93EB-BBE45D42A00C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Production Studies, the Sequel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/07fe24e00cfd8241a1dc5f5031466283"><gtr:id>07fe24e00cfd8241a1dc5f5031466283</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ong, J.
