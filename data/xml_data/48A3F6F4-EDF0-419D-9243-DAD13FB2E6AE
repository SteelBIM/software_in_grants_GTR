This project builds on this by examining whether increasing neural activity in these brain regions can enhance our social perception abilities. To do so, the project will use a brain stimulation technique called transcranial electric stimulation to examine whether we can facilitate facial identity recognition and facial emotion recognition. This will include studies in typical and atypical groups (eg in developmental prosopagnosia - where individuals are unable to perceive the facial identities).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will also build upon recent studies using face-training paradigms to improve facial identity and emotion processing abilities, by stimulating the brain during training. It is predicted that increasing excitability in brain areas shown to be involved in each task will enhance specific social perception skills. It is also expected that pairing social perception training paradigms with brain stimulation will lead to training effects being boosted and lasting longer.&amp;nbsp;The findings will therefore provide insights into the brain mechanisms that contribute to our social perception abilities and determine whether we can influence them in order facilitate social perception abilities in typical and atypical groups.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Academia
Several broader international academic groups will benefit including clinicians and social scientists in other fields. Short-term benefits for these groups will be achieved by supporting the development of innovative approaches examining mechanisms of social perception that will provide novel avenues for future studies in typical and atypical groups. Longer-term benefits may include potential methods to improve social perception abilities in groups with deficits in perceiving social perception cues.

Staff employed on the project will also benefit. For myself (PI), the grant will provide a timely stimulus to develop my research programme conceptually and technically. It will also allow me to develop networking skills with international collaborators involved in the project and the opportunity for international mobility via visits to Dartmouth College (USA). For the RA, it will enable the acquisition of skills in the use of non-invasive brain stimulation, the opportunity to engage in an international project, and experience in working with atypical groups. Each element will therefore promote the delivery and training of highly skilled researchers that will increase the economic competitiveness of UK research. 

2) Industry
By aiding our understanding of mechanisms that contribute to the perception of facial cues the findings will provide immediate benefits to companies involved in developing face recognition systems. The findings will also highlight the utility of using non-invasive brain stimulation as a tool to aid social perception abilities, which may promote growth for brain stimulation companies in the UK and overseas (e.g. Magstim, UK). By determining the efficacy of brain stimulation and perceptual training to improve social perception abilities, the findings will also have the potential to provide longer term benefits to industries interested in developing services to improve social perception abilities. For example, extending the training paradigms to mobile applications for devices like the iPad may offer one avenue for future industrial collaborations / impact (one candidate to take this forward is Six-to-Start Gaming, whom I have previous links with).

3) General public
Short term benefits will include developments in our understanding of the mechanisms that enable us to perceive social signals from the face; how they can breakdown; and whether we can improve social perception abilities with perceptual training and brain stimulation. The findings will also directly benefit individuals with developmental prosopagnosia by determining the potential of non-invasive brain stimulation training paradigms to improve face recognition abilities in that group. A recent paper concluded that the potential for negative psycho-social consequences and occupational disability posed by DP is as great as that posed by conditions that receive professional recognition and support (e.g. dyslexia - [26]), so there is the potential for prominent long term benefit for individuals with DP.

The findings from this project will also provide insights into potential tools to improve social perception abilities more generally, which (if successful) will have long term benefits for broader groups with social perception deficits. For example, healthy aging has been linked to several declines in social perception, which have been associated with reduced levels of social competence and isolation [46]. The findings from this project related to ways to improve these abilities in healthy adults will therefore have the potential to benefit attempts to enhance the quality of life and well-being of older adults. Similarly, the training paradigms will also provide longer term benefits for individuals with other neurodevelopmental disorders linked to deficits in social face perception (e.g. Autistic Spectrum Disorders, William's syndrome) because they may be able to be extended to these groups in future work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242816</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A-Level Conference Goldsmiths September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A533C62-C29E-4AB3-84AD-ADAD91639EC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Raised awareness about research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University of the Third Age (Sutton)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>407E378A-81A9-463B-B7F7-4FDFEE752E09</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 older adults attended the talk, which was focused around how social perception abilities change with age and tools to improve them.

This has been achieved through talks at public symposium, hosting public workshops on social perception, and direct engagement with school groups. More specifically, members of the research team have spoken at several public events and to media about our research over the last year, and have been involved in seven school events to date. In doing so, we have raised awareness of social science research and interest in a variety of age groups (e.g. we have spoken at schools and to the University of Third Age). Additionally, in collaboration with one of our partners involved in this project (Centre for Face Processing Disorders, Bournemouth University; Trouble With Faces Group), some of our data on prosopagnosia was also used in a House of Commons Roundtable discussion on prosopagnosia. The main impact of this was that prosopagnosia has now been added to the NHS choices website with a direct link to the Trouble With Faces Group (for which the PI is Co-Director; http://bit.ly/1QIAAha), leading to a potential increase in awareness of the condition among the public and medical professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DE070D98-9CC6-48BA-B0F3-78F4D0AA29BD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During this three-year project we examined the efficacy of transcranial electrical current stimulation as a tool to modulate social perception abilities. The project focused primarily on the ability to perceive and remember facial identity and facial emotion. We also examined the perception of other social cues including trait perception (e.g. trustworthiness, deception), self-other representations (including theory of mind, visual perspective taking, imitation), mimicry, and music. We have made a number of achievements including developing significant new knowledge; identifying important new research questions; and developing new research partnerships. 

We have exceeded key grant objectives related to dissemination outlined in the original application. The work conducted in the grant has contributed to 26 papers published during the grant period, with 6 additional publications currently submitted for publication and 6 in preparation. The PI and his research team have given over 30 presentations about the work conducted (22 academic talks and 9 public events), and have 8 invitations for the coming year (including 5 Key Note talks). The PI has been part of a number of television projects (including for BBC and Sky) related to the data collected during the grant. The PI has also received two highly prestigious awards related to work conducted during the grant: the BPS Spearman Medal and the Paul Bertelson Award. Each award is given to recognise outstanding contributions to research that has shaped the discipline. 

In terms of new knowledge, we have made advances within each of our streams of research (Stream A - examining mechanisms involved in and approaches to improve facial identity perception in typical and atypical groups; Stream B - examining mechanisms involved in and approaches to improve facial emotion perception in typical groups). Within Stream A, we have identified that a single session of transcranial current stimulation (tCS) can enhance facial identity perception and facial identity memory in typical adults (leading to already published data). We have extended these findings to individuals with developmental prosopagnosia (individuals that show a selective impairment in facial identity perception; DP), and examined whether pairing tCS with training paradigms designed to aid face perception can lead to greater benefits than training alone. We have also conducted a number of studies examining mechanisms of face processing in DP, gaining important insights into our understanding of what neurocognitive mechanisms contribute to DP. These additional studies are in preparation for publication. 

In Stream B, we have also identified approaches to improve facial emotion processing using a single session of tCS in younger and older typical adults (leading to already published data, and papers currently submitted for publication). We have extended this by studying perceptual mechanisms that give rise to trait judgments about faces (leading to already published data) and are examining brain mechanisms related to this. We have also studied the perception of pain and identified important individual difference factors contributing to tCS modulation of empathy (data in preparation for publication). 

In addition, we have considered more broadly the extent to which brain stimulation can be used to aid the perception other social cues. Here we have shown that tCS can be useful to modulate the perception of self-other representations (leading to already published data), lie detection from faces (leading to already published data), and social interaction (leading to already published data), and music perception (leading to already published data).

Collectively, the findings from the project have led to the identification of important new research questions including: the extent to which the improvements seen following a single session of tCS can be harnessed in order to aid training paradigms conducted over multiple sessions designed to facilitate social perception (e.g. emotion processing) and socio-cognitive (e.g. visual perspective taking) skills; how differences in brain excitability of typical and atypical groups (e.g. individuals with DP) contribute to inter-individual variability in social perception skills, and how these differences interact with tCS facilitation effects; how typical aging interact with tCS facilitation effects; and the extent to which tCS can be used to modulate the perception of other social cues (e.g. trait judgment perception). 

They have also led to the generation of novel research partnerships. For example, the PI is now a co-director of the 'Trouble With Faces' group (www.troublewithfaces.org) that seeks to examine the mechanisms involved in and potential remediation strategies of individuals with deficits in face processing abilities (e.g. DP, alexithymia, autism). In the past year this site has received considerable interest including coverage by the BBC. Further, the PI is now an active collaborator with the Centre for Face Processing Disorders (University of Bournemouth) through which a number of joint impact activities have been achieved.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As the first findings to demonstrate improvements in a variety of social domains following tCS, we believe that our findings highlight a productive new research area that will open up several research questions (some of which are noted above) within academia.

Further, the social processing skills that we are seeking to improve are vital aspect of daily life. In atypical groups, deficits in these abilities lead to reductions in communication and social competence, reduced quality of life, and social isolation. Conversely, some individuals use these abilities extraordinarily well and such skills are important for variety of employers (e.g. face identity processing in law enforcement and other security organisations). Given the importance of these abilities, techniques that enhance them could be valuable in healthcare, security and other sectors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1F4D692D-EBC6-48D1-B94D-902CCABC46F7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0161BD28-2AB3-42A3-A7EF-26DF844EBAB4"><gtr:id>0161BD28-2AB3-42A3-A7EF-26DF844EBAB4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hemispheric differences between left and right supramarginal gyrus for pitch and rhythm memory.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dabdcd923ba45329af02d8d01f3a9767"><gtr:id>dabdcd923ba45329af02d8d01f3a9767</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schaal NK</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/571981B0-9F7D-4280-9608-A7AB6A3AF852"><gtr:id>571981B0-9F7D-4280-9608-A7AB6A3AF852</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Am I moving?'
