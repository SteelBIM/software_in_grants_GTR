Archive</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M004457/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The manifold catastrophes of the 20th century have torn holes in the cultural fabric of Europe. This project's overarching objective is to re-knit certain threads across those gaps by bringing recently rediscovered musical, theatrical and literary works by Jewish artists back to the attention of scholars and the public. Scholarly outputs will include monographs, journal articles and critical editions, and the project will have wider impact through an interactive web resource, educational projects, and performances at five international cultural festivals.

Our scholarly work and artistic practice will engage with three types of 'Jewish archives': a) the works themselves, often providing information on the complexities of the context in which they were created; b) traditional archival documentation; c) ethnographic archives (oral history and testimony) providing historical information and illuminating the meaning of events for past and present generations. Rather than privileging any type of archive as 'text' and others as 'context,' we consider all three as co-texts mutually illuminating each other. All are equally valuable aspects of our investigation.

Some of these archives are at risk, giving our work special urgency. While new archives open or are discovered in some parts of the world, the fragile memories of elderly survivors are fast disappearing, and family archives are disposed of or deteriorate. Working alongside partner organisations (performers, educators, museums, libraries, archives and policy-makers) in the UK, US, Central Europe, South Africa and Australia, we will follow existing leads to seek out new archives, and help preserve those that have recently come to light. 

Our multi-disciplinary team brings research expertise allowing us to focus on the period c.1880-c.1950, the most intense period of Jewish displacement in the modern era. Our case studies include recently recovered theatrical manuscripts from the Terezin Ghetto near Prague, musical works from Eastern Europe uncovered in private collections in Australia, South Africa and England, and literary accounts of survivor experiences written immediately after the Holocaust. Via these case studies of Jewish artistic creation in diverse situations of internment, exile or migration, we will illuminate more broadly the role of art in one of the paradigmatic experiences of the modern age: displacement. When do artists use creative works to represent the rupture of displacement, and when do music, theatre and literature create continuity with their former lives, or a bridge between the old life and the new? 

Our co-textual performances create a relationship between past and present, not only by drawing upon on all three types of archives (for example, by interspersing scenes from a rediscovered play with narrated survivor testimony against a backdrop of projected archival images), but by engaging explicitly with the multiple possible meanings of these artefacts from the past, both for their original audiences and ourselves. The performances foreground ways in which that past may live on in our present and future - in a very real sense, 'thinking forward through the past'. Audience response testing, developed during the project, will help us determine how successful we are in generating audience engagement in the present. 

We will attract audiences from widely diverse constituencies by featuring world-leading practitioners such as the Nash Ensemble alongside amateur and student performers, and by staging performances in historically significant venues such as the Terezin Memorial (the site of the former WWII Jewish Ghetto) and Clifford's Tower in York (the site of a 12th-century pogrom). 

We will perpetuate engagement with these archives by encouraging arts practitioners, policy-makers and cultural event programmers to engage with them, and through educational projects in which participants create their own performances based on archival co-texts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Performers: 
Through our five festivals and workshops we will work with c.250 amateur and student performers. The number of performers will vary, from c.15 at the Royal Northern College of Music to as many as 40 in Cape Town and nearby Stellenbosch. Each will perform in at least one concert, sometimes alongside world-leading professionals (e.g. The Nash Ensemble, Goldner String Quartet). We will challenge performers to rethink their approach to performance, especially when engaging with materials pertaining to archives.

Composers:
At least 21 young composers, recruited via our partner institutions, will benefit from workshops aligned with our performance festivals. We will foster deeper understanding of the connections between archival co-texts and new compositions. The workshops are based on a pilot scheme developed by Muir, Fligg and Prof Adam Gorb (Head of Composition at RNCM) in 2014. Future compositions will be performed during our conferences and festivals.

Young professional film-makers:
Our video crew (two at any one time, six in total) will benefit from exploring aspects of Jewish culture that otherwise may have remained unknown to them, and which they can explore in their future work for their own greater impact.

Archive, museum and library professionals:
In collaboration with at least 12 archives, museums and libraries, and influencing at least 20-25 individual professionals in this field, we will encourage new ways of engaging with archival and related collections. We will offer theoretical and practical advice regarding archival reanimation, helping professionals increase public engagement.

Community and school groups:
We will benefit at least 120 school children and 80 adults in community and school projects, introducing them to more nuanced understandings of the relationships between the past, present and future, through the performance of archives and co-production of performance outcomes at events such as Holocaust Memorial Day commemorations. We will work with children and educators from around 12 schools via organisations like the Anne Frank Trust and South African Holocaust and Genocide Foundation, and with community groups like Sinai Synagogue Leeds, Blah Blah Blah Youth Theatre and the Holocaust Survivors Friendship Association.

Cultural event organisers:
In our collaborations with those who organise events professionally (ultimately totalling at least 10 organisations around the world), we will influence future programming decisions and strategies pertaining to the exploitation of archives for performance purposes. We will supply them with the anonymised audience response testing methods we develop, and our results.

Arts policy-makers, funders &amp;amp; politicians:
We aim for impact on public policy at the highest levels nationally and internationally. We will engage with an Arts Council representative, and make submissions to two parliamentary groups, plus the Prime Minister's Holocaust Commission. Via our partner network, we will seek similar opportunities in other countries.

Public arts audiences: 
c.8,000-10,000 people will benefit from high-quality performances in prestigious and popular venues (5 festivals x 5 performances/festival x 400 average attendance). The potential variety of performances (choral, chamber, orchestral, comedy, historical drama, cabaret) will maximise impact. Audiences will expand their knowledge of repertoire, enhance understanding of archival co-texts, and rethink received notions of Jewish culture. 

Website users:
The website audience is potentially huge. The resource will be promoted and added to by our partner organisations, giving it a truly global reach. Users will benefit by being able to engage with our outcomes in a visually appealing way, finding links between co-textual sources, participating in online debates, and viewing academic symposium/conference presentations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1534076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Harlequin in the Ghetto is a performance developed with students at Louisiana State University (LSU) based on the play 'Comedy about a Trap', written in the Terezin Ghetto by Zdenek Jelinek, by adding scenes that portrayed the students' exploration of the history of the ghetto.

To date (March 2017), the exhibition has been displayed at all of our project performances, symposia, and other events since June 2016 - a total of c.nnn occasions in five different cities, in two countries (UK, Czech Republic). In the coming year it will be displayed in two further countries (Australia, South Africa), at our &amp;quot;Archives into the Future&amp;quot; event at the British Library, and at our final conference (as well as at other, unforeseen events).

This has given rise to very many conversations and interactions between project researchers and members of the public (and our project partners), leading people to think anew about the subject of artistic expression during the Holocaust and other related circumstances. A number of exhibition viewers have later followed up with further questions and requests for information, and/or have subsequently attended events in which they might not otherwise have been interested.

The exhibition development process has also had a profound impact upon our University of Leeds Laidlaw Research and Leadership Scholar, who has subsequently expressed interest in postgraduate study in this area.

We have employed this framework in our pilot project in two schools in order to evaluate the feasibility of each approach. Based on feedback received from pupils and our independent analysis, we then reached several conclusions regarding the future implementation of our action plan on a larger scale with necessary modifications to ensure a successful outcome.
This pilot project represented a very good method of identifying some of the challenges of such projects in terms of awareness among school children when addressing the Holocaust. With limited curriculum time dedicated to face-to-face discussion on this topic, our project identified a need to provide additional avenues to facilitate discussion on such topics. This project also identified a need to create workshops dedicated to training the teachers on this subject before introducing it to their pupils. Having teachers moderating at times these types of presentations will ensure students put careful thoughts in comments for more fruitful discussion but in some cases might actually help garner better responses from students shy of speaking up in class in front of strangers. Another alternative to this is to create interactive sessions which not only discuss the Holocaust but do it through an exploratory approach and serve as a model for those teachers who are not familiar with this pedagogical approach. The form and content are linked: &amp;quot;exploring&amp;quot; this subject with children demonstrates how you can treat them with dignity while looking at a system which stripped people of their dignity.
Additionally, the project revealed the necessity of training the teachers in order to avoid transforming the presentation in a history lesson overloaded with too many facts some of which are explained and others glossed over; a moralizing lecture telling the young people why they need to know; a voyeuristic presentation of violence and suffering. This project identified the necessity of developing a more interactive way of delivering such stories in such manner that will engage the students.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In order for this joint-project to be successful the HSFA offered its assistance in identifying two speakers, one for each school, prepared to deliver their stories both in their original version and in a different format as proposed by our Theater in Education Director; the two selected speakers were:
- Mr. Barry Anysz - second generation family of survivor telling the story of his mother Helga and grandmother Elsbeth;
- Mr. Michael Sharp - volunteer speaker (not related to a survivor family) but coming from a point of interest in the project, telling the story of Holocaust survivor Mr. Eugene Black.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The aim of our joint project was to rise awareness on the tragedies of the Holocaust through designing a series of workshops based on the eye witness accounts which are currently told first hand to school children by volunteer speakers who are picking up from where the eyewitnesses have left off and looking at how they can engage young people in schools. These workshops were designed in a more engaging and artistic manner creating a vivid experience for school students and their teachers, in the spirit of the 'Performing the Jewish Archive' Project.
Motivated by a desire to recover archival materials, and to stimulate the creation of new works to re-animate existing archival repositories in order to establish a link between past, present and future, the &amp;quot;Performing the Jewish Archive&amp;quot; Project team (University of Leeds) represented by Dr. Helen Finch (PtJA Co-Investigator) and Mr. Alexandru Bar (PhD Candidate) in collaboration with Mr. Anthony Haddon (Theatre in Education Director), the Theatre Co Blah Blah Blah, and the Holocaust Survivors' Friendship Association (HSFA) represented by Mrs. Lilian Black (Chair) and Dr. Tracy Craggs (Project Manager) created this joint project consisting of a series of interactive workshops based on relevant archival materials.

The event is organised annually by the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, with direct funding from central government. It was held in the presence of 200 Holocaust and genocide survivors and around 1,000 guests. It was also recorded, and extracts (including the elements curated by Dr Muir) feature in a video available on the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust's website.

The project's research was highlighted by the event's narrator, Mishal Husain, demonstrating the importance of our work to a distinguished audience, including the UK Chief Rabbi, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid MP, Leader of the Official Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.

Dr Muir also directed members of the Clothworkers Consort of Leeds chamber choir, performing &amp;quot;Mogen owos&amp;quot; [Shield to our fathers] by Josef Gottbeter, and &amp;quot;Min hammeitzar korosi yoh&amp;quot; [I called upon the Lord in distress; Psalm 118: 5-24], by Froim Spektor and Josef Gottbeter. Both pieces were direct outcomes of Dr Muir's research for Performing the Jewish Archive, discovered in a cache of manuscripts in Cape Town, South Africa.

Audience members subsequently contacted Dr Muir to indicate how much they had been affected by the performance. A number of them enquired about the possibility of having further access to the project's outcomes with a view to integrating them into their own professional (and amateur) practices. Our partner The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust also reported that our participation had considerable impact upon them as an organisation, causing them to rethink some of the ways in which they programme music into important ceremonies like this one, and encouraging them to think more rigorously about the source and meaning of musical elements.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hmd.org.uk/news/uk-commemorative-ceremony-holocaust-memorial-day-2017</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Coordinate music of Josima Feldschuh for Wigmore Recital Hall/BBC 3 Radio concert/documentary, London, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6176BF31-11CA-4B41-B0C0-03078E58BF14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Concert/documentary organised by Dr. Shirli Gilbert, University of Southhampton, &amp;quot;Music at the Brink of Destruction.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concert: The Czech Musical Tradition - Persecution and Inspiration (Prague)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC70D76D-6B8E-4E37-818A-228338C8EAA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Concert of music by Czech composer, including those killed in the Holocaust.

Although the focus is often on the sciences, &amp;quot;Performing the Jewish Archive&amp;quot; was invited to participate because of the project's exploration of the psychological and societal benefits of music and theatre, especially in times of crisis and conflict. Dr Stephen Muir taught a folksong arrangement written in the Terezin Ghetto by composer Gideon Klein to audiences of visitors throughout the day (the session was delivered six times in total). 
After learning the folksong, the audience learned about the circumstances within which it was composed, how prisoners in Terezin used music and theatre as a psychological survival and coping mechanism as well as an act of defiance against the Nazis, and briefly about the fate of the composer and his acquaintances (though the focus was on the beneficial aspects of music and theatre, and not on the horrors of the Holocaust per se, important as that message is).
Finally, the folksong was sung again, this time with emphasis on the allegorical words and poignant musical setting, used by the composer to reflect upon his condition of captivity and express a longing for freedom. Participants reported that they understood far more deeply the significance of such seemingly simple and insignificant works of art, and expressed an appreciation of how the arts can be used in times of crisis to extremely beneficial effect.

Breakout workshops encouraged participants to think deeply about the nature and future of archives, particularly but not exclusively those relating to Jewish culture, and to start to formulate partnerships with others at the workshop with the aim of enriching public engagement with archives through performance and similar activities.

Findings presented at our conference &amp;quot;Magnified and Sanctified: The Music of Jewish Prayer&amp;quot; have been used by a number of non-academic institutions as the basis of public education programmes, cultural event programmes and publicity and promotional opportunities.

Our educational resources have been taken on board by schools in Prague and Madison WI; in Autumn 2017 the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust will make them available to nearly every school in the country.

Whilst they are not strictly &amp;quot;non-academic&amp;quot;, our research-based performances nevertheless overlap with the &amp;quot;non-academic&amp;quot;, creating a bridge between the scholar and the audience, and at the same time bring to life archives and artefacts that would otherwise have remained dormant for the foreseeable future.

A walking tour of Prague is under development, based on Dr Fligg's work on Gideon Klein's life in Prague before WWII. This will be made available to the Prague Tourist Office in both English and Czech, expanding the availability and accessibility of our research to non-academic audiences.

For example, audience response testing in Madison WI in August provisionally suggests that audiences engage with the materials and subjects that we present for reasons other than the expected (detailed results to follow).

New archival discoveries in Australia and South Africa have suggested a far wider dispersal of synagogue music and lighter songs and chamber music than previously anticipated. This will cause a reappraisal of the quantity of source material that may still exist unrecovered in formal and information archives around the world. In addition, our explorations into the question of &amp;quot;empathy and the archive&amp;quot; has led us to think anew about ethical, artistic and, indeed, legal issues surrounding the use of sensitive archives for performative purposes.

Through our series of symposia (in partnership with the British Library and the Care for the Future project &amp;quot;The Anti-Slavery Useable Past&amp;quot;), we are beginning to discover the needs, potential, and limitations of developing creative collaborations between archives and arts practitioners. A further two symposia will take place, during which we intend to refine these discoveries and formulate new strategies and approaches to making such collaborations more effective.

(More will be added in this section during the remainder of the grant funding period.)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will influence understanding of the impact of the Holocaust on music and theatre by Jewish artists. We are already influencing a number of Third Sector organisations around the world (e.g. South African Holocaust and Genocide Foundation; Jewish Museum in Prague; The National Archives; the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust) with regard to the interpretation of archival holdings through the performing arts. We have also been approached as consultants on the detailed content and contextualisation of the new permanent exhibitions in the Jewish museums of Johannesburg and Prague, drawing upon our expertise as archival researchers and scholars of Jewish history and culture.

Our findings will also be of use to professional performers and events organisers, as they attain a deeper understanding of the rupture in European culture that occurred in the twentieth century, and how they might begin to adjust their programming strategies and redress the historical imbalances and misunderstandings that have become commonplace in the past c.100 years.

In education, too, our findings are already having an impact, as evinced by current and upcoming projects with schools in Leeds, York, Madison WI, Prague and Cape Town. Educators will be provided with new strategies and resources to engage students with history and its impact today and in the future, using the arts as an accessible and attractive window into a difficult subject. Our recently-developed partnership with the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust means that our educational resource packs (which work alongside the project exhibition) will be distributed to nearly every school in the UK, and subsequently in South Africa to each Province's teacher training programme.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A2119EC6-9C60-47F0-93C3-04F7B2970190</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ptja.leeds.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum: Holocaust Initiative in Teacher Education Summit</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>734C84CB-FFC4-4DBA-9A36-5D89CDC3629A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK Government Holocaust Commission</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>439EF294-7AB1-42F6-96DB-54D34DB5AC9C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Official website of the Performing the Jewish Archive project showcasing the activity of the project, past and forthcoming events, festivals, conferences.

This process involves filming all audience members' faces and subsequent analysis of the film material using machine learning techniques. Audience faces move as they experience different elements of the performances. The changes include the contraction and relaxation of up to 44 muscles associated with different emotional experiences. Changes in face configuration are visible in the film, and machine learning can be used to evaluate which muscles are active, and thus we can derive which emotions are most present on each face on a frame by frame basis. Through this process, the information we can obtain includes emotions experienced every 20ms by each audience member, the correlation in emotion experience across all of the audience, and the relationship between expressed emotions and the experience of performances reported by the audience.
We are currently investigating how this information can additionally be used to evaluate information about aspects of the personality of individual audience members.</gtr:description><gtr:id>35158202-F323-4BB3-9D9F-7A6B37422904</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No impact has yet to be realized</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Audience Face Analysis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9FBED502-1492-4D2F-80F5-318D674CFEFF"><gtr:id>9FBED502-1492-4D2F-80F5-318D674CFEFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Music and Memory at Liberation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Southerly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/72e7e141e64a4f0c846c1b74fe3b7aee"><gtr:id>72e7e141e64a4f0c846c1b74fe3b7aee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Toltz, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/84E0C97A-1BF2-4666-8CAD-FAC3B6187BDB"><gtr:id>84E0C97A-1BF2-4666-8CAD-FAC3B6187BDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Magnified and Sanctified: The Music of Jewish Prayer</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/aa5d05e24d3d9534169adb4fee4440cd"><gtr:id>aa5d05e24d3d9534169adb4fee4440cd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Muir, S.
