Our tool will be based on an existing system supporting the online writing and assessment of essays, OpenComment (Whitelock &amp;amp; Watt, 2008), but this requires several problems to be solved, both in natural language processing, and in educational theory and practice. This proposal is therefore a truly interdisciplinary one.

The natural language processing problems are how to `understand' a student essay well enough to provide accurate and individually targeted feedback, and how to generate that feedback automatically. We intend to use techniques from document classification (measures of semantic similarity), information extraction, document summarisation, and text generation to address these problems. The tools we build need to be flexible enough to support different types and models of feedback.

The educational problem is how to develop and evaluate effective models of feedback. This requires research into the selection of the content, mode of presentation and delivery of the feedback. The primary aspects of feedback which will be investigated are: summarisation; recognition of positive achievements; location of errors of commission or omission; misconceptions or problems connected with causal relationships; tactical and strategic hints both relating to the specific issues being addressed in the essay and issues connected with `metacognition' (i.e. self awareness of the learning process), and self-regulation of the learning process. For feedback to be effective, it should assist students not only to manage their current essay-writing task, but it should also lead to further development of their essay-writing skills, the skills associated with efficient self-regulation, and their motivation to complete their course. The methods used to obtain data on effectiveness will be student surveys, interviews with selected participants, analysis of the various versions of the essays submitted for feedback, and the quality of the final essay.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Summary of Impact

The research directly impacts on the technology enhanced learning community, the feedback community, the e-assessment community and the e-learning community - as well as the Society for Research into Higher Education. Evidence that state of the art analysis of tests is sufficiently advanced to provide a firm basis for the generation of feedback will be of interest to these communities. The text processing community should find the hybrid approach to textual analysis of short essays to be worth studying further. 

There is the potential for firms such as QuestionMark to find a commercial value to this work.

Less directly, Higher Education Institutes in the UK (and around the world) will benefit either by adopting and further developing the technologies developed within this project or by utilising the research results to inform their own feedback procedures for work carried out online.

Policy makers such as QCA and SQA and other bodies involved in managing Higher Education in the UK and elsewhere will benefit from seeing a proof of concept.

Last, but not least, most students in higher education can benefit from the research - and also, eventually, students in secondary schools. 

The work also has the potential to improve levels of student attainment and enhance their abilities to provide improved feedback in their working lives. This could lead to improvements in the capability of the UK to generate high quality added value products and processes. 

The research staff working on the project will be encouraged to develop their own careers through continuous monitoring and support from the senior researchers, through opportunities to develop their own skills for devising research plans, writing research documents and presenting the work in academic and other settings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>247911</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This video focuses solely on all the functions within the web application, OpenEssayist.

Open Essayist has received interest for use by the Social Science Faculty at the OU to improve student retention. It has been used at the British University in Dubai where students have reported it helped them to write as all of the students were non native English speakers.
We have now received enquiries from the University of Technology in Sydney and the University of South Australia who would like to use OpenEssayist and we are currently exploring how we can progress this work together.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>17A472D5-AF87-4B80-B454-813023ACF86D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>(1) We have demonstrated that it is possible to construct a computer program (EssayAnalyser) which carries out automatic essay structure recognition and uses domain-independent graph-based ranking techniques to derive extractive summaries from students' essays. One of the strengths of the system is that it is domain independent and can be used to analyse any text on any topic. (2) We have demonstrated that it is possible to construct an interface (OpenEssayist) which provides a variety of visual representations and other information based on the output from the EssayAnalyser program. This interface can be used to provide students with automatic feedback on drafts of their essays. (3) We have carried out several sessions of user testing with students who have previously taken a postgraduate module with the Open University, and this demonstrates that students find the representations and other information generated by OpenEssayist of genuine help in the task of drafting their essays.

In parallel with these technical developments, we have also carried out the formal experiments envisaged in the proposal with regard to the effectiveness of advance hints and subsequent feedback on essays. Specifically, we found that providing advance hints led to improvements specifically in the quality of the introduction, the conclusion, and the use of evidence. However, there was no evidence of transfer to subsequent essays written without the benefit of hints. Even so, in a separate study providing formative feedback on one essay led to improvements on a subsequent essay specifically in the use of evidence and the use of referencing as well as in the participants' level of self-efficacy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Because the system is domain-independent, it could be used to support authorship in virtually any context whatsoever. In addition to educational contexts of all kinds, this would encompass any environment that involves the development, dissemination and publication of coherent and well-written text. Prompt feedback is an essential component of all human learning, and the SAFeSEA project has shown that a computer-based system can be constructed which provides instant feedback on any piece of text regardless of its content. This proof-of-concept should be of considerable interest to both public and commercial agencies that might finance the development of more sophisticated versions of the system.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D00E0EEC-A724-4B11-9E27-4CF18DF7D4DC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www9.open.ac.uk/openessayist/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>OpenEssayist is a web application that supports students with writing essays.
