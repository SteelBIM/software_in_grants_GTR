We are studying these phenomena through a combination of sophisticated experiments, based on laser and vacuum technology, and advanced theoretical methods. The understanding that we provide is crucial to the enhanced exploitation or modelling of a wide range of natural or man-made phenomena, from chemistry in the atmosphere, combustion, catalysis, natural photoprotection and the design of sunscreens, through to photodynamic therapy.
The purpose of this Platform is to provide stability and greater flexibility in the use of postdoctoral-level personnel across a group of five academic investigators with an established record of working together in areas spanning the interaction of molecules with liquid surfaces; chemical reactions and the transfer of energy in the gas-phase; and the chemical and physical processes initiated in molecules by the absorption of light.
The Platform will allow us to retain key staff, and to deploy them in ways that are not possible with standard proposals. In particular, we will be able to accelerate our ability to grasp immediate opportunities based on our existing collaborations, both among the group and with external partners, by carrying out critical proof-of-concept studies. We will tackle larger, more complex, multi-stranded projects that will require us to work together in new combinations. We can see the potential for exciting developments in a number of areas, but currently we don't have funds to carry out the groundwork necessary to underpin successful joint proposals. In particular, we aim to expand the areas in which we have close integration between experiment and theory. We will also have the scope to carry out high-risk but adventurous pilot studies to expand into new areas beyond the boundaries of existing work, with potential new collaborators.
The PDRAs employed will benefit greatly from the enhanced career development under the Platform. We will broaden their experience through research exchanges; engage them in proposals to win new funding; support them in applications for personal fellowships with dedicated funds for their own short proof-of-concept projects; and involve them in management of the Platform.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Much of the work that will be enabled by the Platform is fundamentally motivated. The potential for societal and economic benefits is also substantial. The impacts are of three main types: the output of skilled personnel; more direct economic benefits of the results of the research that we expect to be realised primarily in the longer term; and improved public awareness.
Absolutely central to the philosophy of the Platform Grant scheme is the output of highly trained personnel, skilled in the use of modern laser, vacuum, electronic-data capture and data processing technologies, or in forefront computational chemical methods. They will also have well-developed generic and transferable communication, presentation and problem-solving skills. In some cases they will be exposed to financial management on the Operational Management Group. An integral part of our programme is to engage in research exchanges of personnel, in both directions, with existing and proposed new collaborators. Involvement in these interactions, and in the wider group under the Platform, will enhance the skills and experience of the PDRAs. They will be ideally suited to contribute to the growth or creation of high-technology companies, enhancing innovative capacity and consequently increasing business revenues.
The potential direct economic impacts of the results of the research span a wide range of applications. Our gas-liquid work has major implications for gas uptake and sequestration and multiphase catalysis, particularly based on ionic liquids; heterogeneous chemistry on atmospheric aerosol particles; combustion of liquid fuels; through to biological respiration. Our gas-phase collision studies also impact on atmospheric chemistry, combustion, technological plasmas and astrochemistry. We will provide quantitative constraints on, and in some cases new mechanisms that need to be included in, numerical models of these complex collisional environments. The improvements in spectroscopic detection that we will develop, and the greater understanding of the effects of collisional quenching that we will provide, will broaden the range and increase the quantitative accuracy of methods of detection of trace-species concentrations. These will be adopted by applied scientists and engineers investigating either the atmosphere itself or combustion systems that are the potential sources of pollutants. The ultimate societal benefit will result from consequent regulatory changes. Our studies of electronic excitation, photophysics and photochemistry will inform scientists and engineers working in more applied areas including the rapidly emerging fields of biophysics, molecular switches and photochromic polymers, photoprotective compounds such as sunscreens, and photodynamic therapy. Ultimately, uptake of this research has the potential to yield health benefits in medical therapies and disease prevention. Although not the primary aim of this proposal, a secondary benefit may be the development of new technical methods or techniques that generate commercial interest. Any such intellectual property will be protected and exploited in consultation with HWU Research &amp;amp; Enterprise Services.
We will also continue to enhance public awareness of science. We will involve the PDRAs in the dissemination of the aims and results of this work to the wider public, at a suitable level, extending our group's on-going contributions to Open Days, careers events, a resident Chemistry Teachers Week, and external events such as Science and the Parliament and the Edinburgh Science Festival.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-08-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1277251</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P001459/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>666CC8F4-4525-49AF-91C1-5675E0C8ADDF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chem.
