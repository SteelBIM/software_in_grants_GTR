Around the world, including in the UK, these disposable people are held against their will, trapped in a situation of control such as a person might control a thing, and forced to work for no pay. This number is more than at any point in history and more people than were transported from Africa to the Western Hemisphere during the entirety of the Atlantic slave trade. It is a number greater than the population of Australia and almost seven times greater than the population of Ireland. It includes around 1.1 million enslaved people in Europe. Over the past 15 years, a growing movement against this new global slavery has achieved many successes, including new legislation, a small number of prosecutions, changes to company supply-chains, and increased public awareness. But it is repeating mistakes of the past. Around the world, it starts from scratch rather than learning from earlier antislavery successes and failures. Focused on urgent liberations and prosecutions, antislavery workers operate within short time frames and rarely draw on the long history of antislavery successes, failures, experiments and strategies. At the same time, the public reads about shocking cases of women enslaved for 30 years in London, children enslaved in rural cannabis factories, and the large number of slaves who mine the conflict minerals used to make our mobile phones and laptops. For many of us, this presence of slavery confounds our understanding of history: wasn't slavery brought to an end? Weren't the slaves emancipated? This confusion extends beyond the public to politicians, policy makers, human rights groups, and educators. Official responses to slavery cases often reflect this confusion, expressing more emotional outrage than clear thinking. 

However, responding to recently-expressed interest by antislavery groups and policy makers, including the recent appeal by Luis C. DeBaca (Ambassador in the State Department Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons) for scholars to translate the lessons of abolitionism for contemporary use, our project seeks to provide this movement with a usable past of antislavery examples and methods. We will bring to the present the important lessons from antislavery movements and policies of the past, and help translate those lessons into effective tools for policy makers, civil society, and citizens. As we identify, theorise and embed antislavery as a protest memory for contemporary abolitionism in this way, we will also emphasise that what earlier antislavery generations achieved was harder than what we face today, we don't have to repeat the mistakes of past movements, the voices of survivors are the best signposts to where we should be going next, and the lessons of past antislavery movements offer a way to 'care for the future'. 

Throughout the project and across all its strands, we offer in the face of a mammoth task-ending the enslavement of 30 million people-a reminder of past antislavery achievements. For example, on the eve of the American Revolution, few Americans could envision a world in which slavery did not exist. Yet 100 years later, slavery did become illegal in the United States. This was an achievement that stemmed from the collective, varied and ever-evolving protest of countless slaves and abolitionists. Today we have a chance to end slavery, and to do so within our own lifetimes. This will be a watershed for humanity, a moment when we finally reject *the* great lie of history, that some people are sub-human, and embrace instead that great abolitionist truth-the truth that earlier abolitionists tried to teach us-that labour must not be forced and that people are not for sale.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Over the past 15 years the global antislavery movement has experienced exponential growth. There are now antislavery groups in most countries, ranging from the tiny and suppressed El Hor in Mauritania, to the small but powerful Norwegian Anti-Slavery Society, to the many British and North American campaigning groups each with more than 100,000 members, and the Walk Free campaign with more than 5 million registered supporters worldwide. Altogether there are likely to be 10 million people who think of themselves as antislavery activists. But the growth of this movement masks disorganization, widely different interpretations of the needed work, and a profoundly ahistorical consciousness. Our project will foster critical memory within the movement, reclaiming varied modes of protest from the narrow and nostalgic storyline of antislavery's past. By the end of our project, and during our follow-through year (5), we hope to observe and measure: 

1. Early shifts in scholarship toward incorporating contemporary slavery and antislavery into studies of slavery more broadly (which usually end in the late 19th century).
2. Early shifts in scholarship toward debating the ideas of a usable past and protest memory, so that the field of Memory Studies has expanded from its current focus on trauma, memory-as-burden and nostalgia.
3. Changes in how antislavery organisations use imagery, from their current tendency toward sensationalist images of slave passivity and abolitionist paternalism to a liberatory aesthetic of slave rebellion and empowerment.
4. Changes in how antislavery organisations use slaves' voices, from their current tendency to just quote or paraphrase, to placing slave narratives at their heart of the movement: in their campaign materials, in their own strategies (for we believe narratives can be analysed for antislavery ideas and solutions), and even in their leadership structures (where former slaves could take a more central leadership role).
5. The incorporation of several other abolitionist lessons from our seminars and resources into NGO campaigns and approaches.
6. The adoption of the Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines by NGOs and governments as the standard against which to measure the global population of enslaved people and the global phenomena of slavery and trafficking.
7. An increased awareness on the part of policy makers of the lessons of the antislavery past as they confront and address the slavery of the present, as seen in legislation, regulation, and the support of civil society organisations.
8. Shifts in how our heritage partners tackle the topic of slavery, to incorporate more material on contemporary forms in their exhibitions and public programming.
9. The use of our Congo photographs exhibit by local antislavery groups in Congo, as part of their ongoing work against the enslavement of 500,000 people there today.
10. A collection of short films submitted to Unchosen by filmmakers that incorporate history as a result of our work on Unchosen's themed competition series.
11. The creation of sustainable profession-specific networks, for artists, historians and lawyers, each achieving impact in their specific fields.
12. The use of our resources in school teaching.
13. New knowledge and application of the usable past on the part of the antislavery workers who take our MA module.
14. Potential changes in how we will approach the 200th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the British Empire in 2033, based on our documentation and analysis of how Britain commemorated the bicentenary of the ending of the slave trade in 2007 (the limitations and successes of that 2007 bicentenary).

This talk explored this issue using Local Roots/Global Routes, a collaborative project run by the Legacies of British Slave-ownership project at UCL and Hackney Museum and Archives, as an example. The project explored Hackney's links to transatlantic slavery, helping to expand the history already being taught about abolitionists in the area to also reflect the presence of slave-owners and people of African descent. It did this through archival research, explorations of built heritage, and direct engagement with teachers and young people. In the process, the project also addressed constructs of the past that either ignored or distorted the histories of people of African descent, particularly the history of Africa before European contact and the role played by enslaved Africans in the fight against slavery. The audience was around 12 people, mainly educational researchers and practitioners. There was an interesting debate afterwards. The panel included a representative from the Institute of Education which has helped to strengthen an existing relationship as we started to make future plans for another project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ucl.ac.uk/institute-of-advanced-studies/ias-events/conflict-confrontation-and-justice-confronting-past-injustices-by-teaching-forgotten-histories</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Talk to Wimbledon Quaker Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ECC28BC7-55BC-4427-8404-A404AF81BFA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The antislavery usable past was presented as a key message within this address.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Re-presenting slavery: making a public useable past website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4078C29-A44C-4118-8C7A-6C9564706C09</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The website contains information on new scholars, heritage practitioners, and community historians working on the subject of slavery.

BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra's Stories
Radio 1 Stories hears from young people who were trafficked and enslaved in the U.K. These people bravely speak out against their former slave owners and traffickers to tell their stories. Presented by Radio 1's Dev. We may have thought the U.K. abolished slavery but it is still happening in brothels, farms, construction sites, car washers, nail bars and even on your street. Victims are usually vulnerable individuals, often captured when they're young and may never know a life of freedom.

Slaves can be controlled on an international scale by their traffickers and slave holders. And yet this crime is hidden from the police and the public.

It considered how academic history has shaped public perceptions of slavery and how public debate has challenged and inspired scholarship. It gave critical attention to the ways in which slavery and colonialism has shaped both our public and academic history institutions. Given the increasing emphasis on 'impact' within university research agendas the event offered new possibilities for building relationships across academic and public history. Public history was conceived of in its broadest sense and speakers were invited from among museum and heritage professionals, artists, community historians, activists, academics, poets, performers and educators. There was an evening of performance, conversation and music that will explore transatlantic slavery and its legacies through the work of renowned Jamaican poet Jean 'Binta' Breeze and guest artists and musicians. The second day was a half day workshop focused on local history activism in Nottingham and the East Midlands. There were 120 attendees. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive with people citing a variety of different reasons for enjoying the event. Many people commented on the value of bringing together different disciplines, individuals and organisations involved with the public representation of slavery.

The conference was organised by Katie Donington. Jean Allain and John Oldfield participated as chairs for two panels on 'Reparations' and 'Race' respectively. Mary Wills, Rebecca Nelson and Hannah Jeffrey all acted as facilitators. Hannah also tweeted throughout the day and engaged in online conversations with people who were viewing the conference through the live feed as well as audience members.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.octoberdialogues.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Address to Annual Meeting of Rotary International</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F4067E3-B177-4F65-B3F3-933AF615182F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation made to Rotary International in Norwich UK promoted the idea of an antislavery usable past and was able to influence decision making and stimulate future activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Picturing Frederick Douglass&quot; talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5C0091A3-2D26-40D8-8DB5-0205930BC69D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper at the British American Nineteenth Century Historians conference</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Race and Gender: The Creole in Historical Perspective - School Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC4072FF-7790-4BC8-AC1C-8FF43C3BA9C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I delivered a lecture to students at Latymer Grammar School in Edmonton, London.

The first day of the event featured a Public Forum - an Intercultural Dialogue on Human Rights and Justice co-hosted with the African and Caribbean Support Network of Northern Ireland (ACSONI) entitled Dealing with the Past, Looking to the Future. A pre-Conference Workshop entitled Historical Injustice and Reparations took place on the second day, co-hosted by Dr Jeremy Watkins (QUB Philosophy) and coinciding with the Royal Institute of Philosophy's Annual Conference of the Society of Applied Philosophy held in Belfast.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The Public Forum focused on community engagement, working with ACSONI to reach out to the local African and Caribbean communities as well as the broader public. Scholar activists, academics, and public officials from across the UK and Ireland were brought together to discuss research, activism, and policy with the participants. Presenters engaged with the feedback, questions, and views of the public, creating multilateral discourse. Irish experiences of colonialism and anti-imperialism were acknowledged, building solidarity between people of African descent in Northern Ireland and the Irish Catholic community. This solidarity was recognised as being crucial to dealing with racial violence and discrimination within Northern Ireland.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
The Public Forum was framed around the question 'what is the Maangamizi?' introducing a concept developed by scholar-activists of African descent into both the public and academic discourse. The Maangamizi - the African holocaust of chattel, colonial, and neo-colonial enslavement perpetrated by Europeans and their prodigy - is a term central to many reparations and justice movements seeking to address the suffering of people of African descent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Guest speakers included internationally acclaimed reparationist, advocate and radio broadcaster Esther Stanford-Xosei, Dr Nathaniel Tobias Coleman, Dr Kwesi Tsri, Dr Christopher Stange - Hon. Consul for St Vincent and the Grenadines to Northern Ireland, Minister of Finance Mairtin O'Muilleor MLA, Michael McEachrane, and Elly Odhiambo.&amp;nbsp;
The pre-Conference Workshop sought to settle the Maangamizi into the academic discourse through constructive dialogue between mainstream academics, scholar activists, and representatives from the Public Forum. Participants presented academic papers on issues relating to intergenerational justice and repair, with particular consideration of the place of marginalised communities and persons within their research. The importance of engaging with the voices of those people was consistently highlighted, and the ideas and language of activist communities was discussed and incorporated into the scholarship.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Rather than simply seeking to disseminate information to the public, this two day event promoted active engagement of both the public, activists, and academics, enriching the academic discourse through consideration of concepts developed by scholar-activists. The Forum also helped to engage a broader audience with issues associated with the past, whilst respecting for the voices of marginalised persons and their contributions. The event created a unique opportunity for the development of networks including academics, scholar-activists, activists, public officials and members of local communities.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contributor to Faculty Teaching Institute on Picturing Frederick Douglass:  An Illustrated Biography of the Nineteenth Century's Most Photographed American at the Museum of African American History, Boston</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DFE671F1-1370-4FDC-BE72-AE99DEF5C1DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provided teachers from the Boston area with materials about the importance of anti-slavery murals as a tool for unofficially preserving history, as well as the contemporary impact of Frederick Douglass's memory and legacy in African American communities.

The main event will consider the ways in which slavery has been taught in both formal and informal learning environments. Bringing together historians, teachers (all levels / formal and informal), community groups, public history professionals, activists and students, this event will share different kinds of practice and approaches to the subject. It will also act as a brokering event to facilitate relationships between different institutions and individuals. The event is the start of the conversation and we hope for some concrete outcomes going forwards. The planning forum is a space in which different interested individuals can come together to help shape the form, content and legacies. The event and its offshoots should meet a need - we hope that in bringing together different perspectives we will formulate something that is useful to different groups.

The debate focused on the connection with armed conflict. The Freedom Fund called for the Security Council to label widespread and systematic human trafficking by armed groups as a crime against humanity, appoint a Special Envoy to better organise and focus UN efforts, and support supply chain transparency efforts. The outcome of the debate was a Presidential Statement calling for the UN Secretary General to report back to the Security Council in 12 months on progress in achieving measures outlined in the statement. This means that the issue remains firmly on the agenda of the Council, and hence provides the opportunity for further high level engagement.

In addition to UN Security Council engagement, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has publicly responded to the report, pledging the commitment of the ICC to &amp;quot;highlight the severity of such crimes and hold the perpetrators accountable&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://freedomfund.org/blog/slavery-and-the-united-nations/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Public Consultation: on the Transparency in Supply Chains Clause in the Modern Slavery Act 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64C3EB01-139F-4640-A969-0208E30FBC6B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/modern-slavery-and-supply-chains</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Set out States' Antislavery Obligations at the United Nations Headquarters</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A3FAD76-3801-4443-B140-8E1DB3DA58B9</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.eventbrite.com/e/on-states-anti-slavery-obligations-tickets-32125318693#</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The No Project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7FC0DCB-D390-460C-BE26-6F050C116172</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Zoe Trodd is an adviser to the No Project, an NGO based in Europe that campaigns against modern slavery.

In this regard, the Antislavery Usable Past grant, which provided funding for the dissemination of the Guidelines, has provided to deliver a step-change in the fight against modern slavery.

This is so as the established legal definition of slavery, which previously was thought not to apply in international law was accepted by the Court to apply (some 90 years after it was first established in the 1926 Slavery Convention) on the basis of the development of the 2012 Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines, my Written Testimony, and my Expert Evidence given to the Court.

In legal terms, this determination establishes at the regional level of the Americas that modern cases of slavery are to be prosecuted and thus provided for the first time in 90 years, the possibility of the prohibition of slavery being enforced. In legal terms, this impact is fundamental: previous to the 2012 Bellagio-Harvard Guidelines and its acceptance by the Inter-American Court in 2016 there existed an international consensus that slavery (again: in law) did not exist, and thus those who enslaved could not be prosecuted. The Inter-American Court's judgement is the end of the beginning: It is a recognised that parameters can be place around modern manifestation of slavery and thus can, be prosecuted. What remains now is to move to have this determination accepted in other regional and domestic settings. That said, the reach of this impact in currently regional (the Americas, North and South), but its reach may extent international as other regional and domestic courts look to this determination as being persuasive.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/casos/articulos/seriec_318_por.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Code of Practice on the Exercise of Maritime Powers Under the Modern Slavery Act 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FD7D430-537C-4CBE-914C-11026E2EDA70</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://blogs.qub.ac.uk/hrc/files/2016/01/QUB-HRC-Comments-on-Maritime-Powers-21-Dec-2015.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation on the Transparency in Supply Chains Clause in the Modern Slavery Bill'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F98F94CE-D85E-4D8A-871D-D91BCC223E7C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>APuZ- German Parliamentarian Supplement</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E46A5D56-9D7D-47FD-997F-7839E7EB3A23</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bpb.de/apuz/216480/sklaverei-und-internationales-recht</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Joint Meeting US Government departments, Washington DC, Kevin Bales address on measuring prevalence of slavery</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF640121-2075-4FE2-BBD0-0843B8001855</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Legatum Institute and Modern Slavery Bill</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA3B612C-C7F3-4D84-A7C6-C64EB74DA5FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Abolitionism, Oldfield explained, brought Britain together in a mass extra-parliamentary moral uprising for the first time in its history. The challenge they faced was huge. Slavery was a fact of life in 18th-century Britain. The abolitionists had to recalibrate not just the law but the moral fibre of the nation. Yet individuals with a vested interest in the slave trade made up Britain's oligarchic political structures.

The abolitionists therefore relied on petitions to pressure parliament. They built &amp;quot;monster petitions&amp;quot; the size of tree trunks, which they carried into parliament on the shoulders of ten people, illustrating the weight of public opinion they brought with them. 

This sea-change in public opinion spread to every sphere of society. Josiah Wedgwood's &amp;quot;Kneeling Slave&amp;quot; image with the slogan &amp;quot;Am I Not a Man and a Brother?&amp;quot; became a must-have item for the fashion-conscious, and the plan of the Brookes slave ship, illustrating the cramped conditions of slaves in transit, circulated widely as one of the slave trade's horror stories. 

Answering questions from Cristina Odone, Director of Communications at the Legatum Institute, on women's role in the movement, Oldfield explained that women were crucial to the anti-consumption campaign that forced British business to its knees. They boycotted slave-made Caribbean goods in favour of sugar and coffee from the East Indies.

Mike Dottridge, a human rights adviser to the United Nations, drew parallels between the entrenched business interests that abolitionists had to fight in the 19th century and the powerful corporate lobby in British politics today. 

Parosha Chandran, a human rights barrister at 1 Pump Court Chambers, voiced concerns about the re-enslavement of freed victims. Asked whether an adaptation of the 19th-century apprenticeship scheme could break the cycle, Oldfield explained that the idea was itself a failure. The abolitionists failed to ensure that former slaves were aware of their rights under the scheme, leading to further exploitation and, ultimately, the abolition of apprenticeships in 1838. 

Revd Rachel Carnegie, Director of the Anglican Alliance, asked about the role of religion in Britain's first abolitionist movement. Oldfield explained that non-mainstream Christian denominations, such as the Quakers, used abolitionism as a way to unite. The eventual effect of that unison and activism in support of abolitionism had a powerful effect on British civil society. 

Frank Field MP advocated the need to &amp;quot;call a spade a spade&amp;quot;. Referring to the problem as &amp;quot;modern slavery&amp;quot; rather than &amp;quot;human trafficking&amp;quot;, he argued, allows the debate to develop in a more targeted and coherent fashion, because &amp;quot;trafficking&amp;quot; is associated with the commercial and impersonal.

Once &amp;quot;slavery&amp;quot; is the term around which the debate is centred, Field continued, it is important not just to report on the issue, but also to systematically update and substantiate research in the area, and to provide a clear direction for positive action and engagement.

As an example, Field cited the power of the Commonwealth. Many of the supply chains tainted by slavery pass through former Commonwealth territory, he explained. Therefore the anti-slavery cause has the potential to reunite the Commonwealth countries behind a clearly-defined moral agenda, in a manner reminiscent of their successes in the abolition of apartheid. This, Field claimed, could give the British Commonwealth a totally new lease of life.

Field stressed the value of encouraging former slaves to come forward and speak about their experience publically. Doing so would bring to life an otherwise often abstract issue whose atrocities are difficult to imagine, he argued.

The success of the first abolitionist movement, Field claimed, was dependent on the powerful civil society in Britain at the time. Correspondence societies wrote letters en masse to Members of Parliament, demanding their support for the abolitionist cause. The Church, Field argued, is the one institution in Britain with the political and popular wherewithal to replicate this today.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Consultation with BBC radio documentary</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E317A507-DA54-4A80-B797-EAB916165F03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Zoe Trodd consulted with Snappin' Turtle Productions during their production of a BBC radio documentary about modern slavery, providing case studies of past antislavery figures for use during a segment that set historical and modern voices side by side.

There are more slaves alive today than at any point in history. Around the world, nearly 46 million people are forced to work against their will for no pay. Responding to this challenge over the past 20 years, a new antislavery movement has shown us that a world without slavery is possible. Now is your chance to learn about this major human rights issue with the world's first massive open online course about contemporary slavery.

Understand contemporary slavery
You'll learn from experts at the cutting edge of human rights research, and you'll investigate the complex systems that sustain slavery today.

You will consider:

Different forms of slavery

Ground-breaking research about slavery's measurement and definition

Strategies for ending slavery at the local, national and international levels

The roles of governments, businesses, technology, legislation and enslaved people themselves in ending slavery

Explore the historical context of slavery
The new UN Sustainable Development Goals now call for an end to global slavery by 2030, but how can we achieve this? To end slavery in the future, first we must look to the past. On the course we will look at the historical context of slavery and antislavery. What antislavery techniques have worked to date? Do past antislavery movements offer any lessons? Is historical antislavery a usable past for today's efforts?

Learn from experts in the field
This course is supported by the AHRC Care for the Future research grant &amp;quot;The Antislavery Usable Past&amp;quot; and features research and teaching from experts in human rights and in past and present antislavery. It is taught by Professor Kevin Bales, the world's leading expert on contemporary slavery and one of the leaders of the antislavery movement, along with Professor Zoe Trodd, a leading expert on antislavery, and Dr. Katie Donington, a slavery historian.

You will have access to the most cutting-edge research available in this area and be part of brainstorming a new guide for ending slavery that covers every level, from the individual to the United Nations.

On this course you have the chance to not only learn about slavery and antislavery, but also debate and shape solutions for the next phase of the contemporary antislavery movement. This course is an essential experience for anyone who wants to be part of a great human rights battle of our time.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE826771-F7FC-48F2-A5BA-D26C88F13ED1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We reached 8000 learners, from at least 150 different countries (from all continents except Antarctica). Several NGOs (including one in Cambodia) asked their staff members to take the MOOC for staff development, and it was embedded in at least five undergraduate courses in the UK, US and Australia. In the last step of the MOOC, the learners came up with their own pledges for what they would do next in their lives towards ending slavery locally, nationally and internationally. As it was so popular, we run it again in May 2017 (rather than waiting another year).
