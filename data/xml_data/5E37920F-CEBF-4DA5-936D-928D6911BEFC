A specific focus is whether forming CoPs might help struggling communities cope within an increasingly resource-stretched environment. Might they bring people together to solve common problems, overcoming differences in perspective brought about by specific organisational affiliations and personal backgrounds? Data includes: a literature review, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with CUP members, and Chicago fieldwork. Our study developed the research capacity of a local practitioner who shared the project's learning within his ethnic minority community and beyond.

Data analysis indicated the versatility of the CoP approach for individuals working in partnership across boundaries (for example voluntary, statutory and university sectors). Strikingly, our literature review shows little application of the CoP approach to CUPs, beyond our own limited work. In the literature, CoPs are critiqued for not dealing explicitly with inequalities; while they may offer space to address differences, there is limited analysis of how CoPs work through inter-group conflicts. However our empirical data revealed more potential. Given this promise, future research priorities include (1) empirical studies of CoPs designed to provide effective mechanisms for developing cohesion and learning, and (2) enhancing the role of community partners in co-production and community knowledge exchange.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The 'One Step Forward - Understanding and promoting resilience for young people in care' is a visual guide to resilience produced by young people from the Brighton and Hove Virtual School.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A45EBC51-DB7B-4F13-B20F-B9E6D0B39FC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The One Step Forward visual guide to resilience proved to be a very useful resource with over 100 books being ordered.

The 'Resilience House' exhibition showcased the various RCUK resilience related projects with which the University of Brighton and boingboing have been involved. Within the 'Resilience House' there were various areas that corresponded to the 5 key areas of the resilience framework and within these we displayed videos, posters, resilience guides and other artistic outputs. Young people with complex needs and mental health difficulties co-curated the event and they explained the outputs to the visitors and were also involved in interactive aspects of the house such as making a 'Resilient tablecloth' and making a 'Resilience cake'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F139921-2702-4CB2-A333-4AF82FC4D3AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The festival ran for 2 days and on the second day, the 'Resilience House' was viewed by 135 people (accurate visitor statistics for day one are not available).

We have received requests to exhibit the 'Resilience House' at other conferences and events in the UK. The young people who co-curated and participated in the event have reported being more confident and they have experienced improvements in their mental health. Boingboing has appointed one of the young people as an artist in residence and they have a Visiting Fellowship at the University of Brighton.

The forum was lead by members of the Blackpool HeadStart team (HeadStart is a &amp;pound;75m programme funded by the Big Lottery Fund to build the emotional resilience of young people aged 10-16). The Blackpool HeadStart Partnership shared their resilience model which helps explore potential resources available for young people to build their resilience individually, within their family, school and community. This new and innovative approach to applying resilience theory in practice is highly thought provoking and begins with the question 'What can we change together, so children and young people can flourish and belong?' 25 people attended the forum including a couple of people from Public Health England, who are developing a position statement on Adolescent Resilience to support local authorities to implement their approaches . There were also YoungMinds staff, someone from the Department of Health, a smattering of freelance consultants and NHS doctors and some young people on work experience at YoungMinds from various other London-based charities making up the 25 strong audience.

A specific focus is whether forming CoPs might help struggling communities cope within an increasingly resource-stretched environment. Might they bring people together to solve common problems, overcoming differences in perspective brought about by specific organisational affiliations and personal backgrounds? Data includes: a literature review, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with CUP members, and Chicago fieldwork. Our study developed the research capacity of a local practitioner who shared the project_s learning within his ethnic minority community and beyond. Data analysis indicated the versatility of the CoP approach for individuals working in partnership across boundaries (for example voluntary, statutory and university sectors). Strikingly, our literature review shows little application of the CoP approach to CUPs, beyond our own limited work. In the literature, CoPs are critiqued for not dealing explicitly with inequalities; while they may offer space to address differences, there is limited analysis of how CoPs work through inter-group conflicts. However our empirical data revealed more potential. Given this promise, future research priorities include (1) empirical studies of CoPs designed to provide effective mechanisms for developing cohesion and learning, and (2) enhancing the role of community partners in co-production and community knowledge exchange.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project has already influenced others to use the communities of practice approach in developing Community University Partnerships.
