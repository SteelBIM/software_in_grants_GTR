Critical to the process is the computer algorithms that are able to reconstruct the 3D images from many (often over a thousand) shadowgraphs. There are two critical steps to obtaining useful information from tomography i) the reconstruction of a 3D image from 2D projections and ii) the analysis and quantification of features in the 3d object. While the techniques is rapidly growing in popularity, most users have fairly limited options when trying to recover the 3D image and are able to write only fairly primitive computer programs to extract key features from the images. The aim of this Collaborative Project is to establish a toolbox within which different reconstruction algorithms, artefact reduction codes, and image analysis procedures are made available to all.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Society
The Flagship project will deliver considerable benefit in the area of Medical Imaging. Image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) equipment with integrated kilo-voltage X-ray cone-beam CT underpins the standard of care recommended by the National Radiotherapy Advisory Group in 2007. Indeed practicing clinical experts in medical x-ray CT within our network helped to develop IGRT treatment machines within an international consortium, such that the world's first IGRT treatment was actually delivered in Manchester at The Christie. The involvement of such experts will enable gains to be drawn down into medical imaging. Further with an installed base of approximately 240 linear accelerator treatment machines in the UK, a national build up to some ~0.25 Pbytes a year of reconstructed image volumes can be anticipated. Improved image quality will be essential to support dynamic tumour targeting, treatment intervention and adaptation. We already have academics involved in clinical medicine from Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham committed to becoming involved in the network; this will provide a significant pathway to impact.

Economy
The flagship project will benefit industrial inspection: At present there are 1000s of x-ray radiography machines operating in industry, primarily at Airports and for quality inspection. Fast CT machines coupled with automatic threat recognition will start to replace radiography over the next five years.

Industrial attendees will be encouraged to attend the training and science workshops and the PDRA will be expected to identify from our industrial partners the key issues from their perspective prior to developing the algorithms. We have already received commitment from Gatan, Nikon Xtek, Xradia and Simpleware who manufacture x-ray imagers or software that relies on tomography data to participate. As well as being key to our providing access to image data formats used to record data collected on their equipment, this will provide a pathway to exploitation of the software by UK users of their equipment and software. 

As a guide to anticipated take-up, toolboxes for space weather developed by Cathryn Mitchell (UoB) are used in over 10 countries. Obviously the CCP covers a much broader range of tomography applications and more industrial users and consequently the uptake is expected to be far greater than this (see Critical Success Factors). Further, as the CCP develops and broadens its remit into other tomographic applications (e.g. PET, TEM, etc) this community will grow. 

Knowledge 
One of the key pathways to impact will be the two annual workshops and training exercises. These will enable knowledge transfer to the academic community. In addition much of the supporting information to enable the community to draw down the algorithms will be provided on the web. The travel budget of the PDRA is also sufficient to allow them to meet with academics across the country to help maximise knowledge transfer.

People
The groups at Manchester and Bath have a strong record of developing young researchers with 16 students going on to lectureships or chairs. Involvement in a multidisciplinary community is expected to provide an incubator for new scientists and engineers on the Harwell site. 

Finally, visual information can be a great aid to understanding ('seeing is believing'). This project will deliver results that can be appreciated by the novice as well as the expert. To this end it will have a significant public engagement mission developing short animations that showcase the imaging outcomes for showing to politicians, industrialists, members of the people as well as schoolchildren. These will be made available for all within the network to use for advocacy on behalf of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>469584</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Diamond Open Days</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65B82B1B-D46B-4C1B-A787-0415472ADC0F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Diamond Open day 2013 &amp;quot;X-ray imaging of functional materials&amp;quot;

It has provided many exciting in situ imaging applications covering a wide range of time and length scales, e.g.: the development, testing and validation of multi-scale microstructurally faithful modelling based on monitoring the evolution of real microstructures; following corrosion, fatigue, stress corrosion, and many other degradation processes; in situ monitoring of chemical processes such as fuel cell operation; in situ processing, e.g. chemical manufacturing processes; nanofabrication processes and in vitro studies of bio-scaffolds.

Research carried out has shed light on structure and structural evolution across topics as diverse as: the structural performance of bone and of nuclear graphite as they degrade due to osteoporosis and radio-degradation, respectively, consolidation by powder metallurgy processing, flow through porous systems, self-healing of materials, the first study to reveal the structural changes taking place during the pupation of butterflies, barely visible impact damage in carbon composites and structure/property relationships in artificial skin. Digital image correlation in 3D has been used to track the changes in structure during repeated dilatation/contraction during lithiation/di-lithiation that contributes to degradation of lithium batteries upon repeated cycling. It has also been demonstrated that high resolution X-ray tomography is an attractive alternative for imaging extracellular matrix structures, including for example the layered structure of heart, tendon, skin and artery wall, as well as the internal structure of cells and their migration into tissue engineering scaffolds.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Recently there has been a focus on bringing multiple characterisation techniques to bear on the same area of interest. We have extended this to three and four dimensions, termed Correlative Tomography. We intend to advance the science and application of correlative tomography to radically increase the nature and level of information (morphological, structural and chemical) that can be obtained for a 3D volume of interest (VoI) deep within a material or component. 

We intend to build the capability of correlative tomography by connecting platforms across scales and modalities so as to track a VoI that may be located deep below the surface across multiple instruments as well as to combine multiple techniques within a single platform. Then use this capability and apply it to gain new insights into damage accumulation.

Correlative tomography has the potential to provide a much richer multi-faceted hierarchical picture of materials behaviour from life science to food science, from geology to cultural heritage. This project will focus specifically on identifying the nucleation, propagation and aggregation of damage processes in engineering materials. We will identify and track the mechanisms that control the progressive degradation of conventional bulk engineering materials operating under demanding conditions. We will examine the hierarchical strategies nature uses to control failure in natural materials through heterogeneous chemistry, morphology and properties. Alongside this we will examine the behaviour of man-made nano-structured analogues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>598A76F2-8769-41FF-A484-E414B876D8BF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>CCPForge started its life a collaborative software development environment tool for the Collaborative Computational Projects (CCP) community but now it has now broaden it scope to all UK computational research and development projects.
