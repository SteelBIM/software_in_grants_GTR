However, in order to calculate any specific property of such a microscopic particle, one usually considers it in isolation - as if there was nothing else around in the whole world. In many cases this is justified in the sense that the impact of the rest of the world has only a very marginal effect on this microscopic particle and its properties, but there are also quite a few cases where this is not true and where the immediate vicinity of a microscopic particle radically alters the particle's properties and behaviour. Even more importantly, there are many examples in modern technology that make use of such effects and tailor the properties of a quantum system by suitably altering its environment. One prominent example are laser diodes, as used for example in CD and DVD players: these are quantum well lasers which are so much more efficient than early laser designs because the quantum well is used to force the emission of radiation into the desired lasing mode while suppressing radiation into other directions where it would be lost.This project deals with ways to alter the properties of the spin of an electron due to reflecting surfaces nearby. So far this has been investigated only in a very crude model. We want to determine how the precise material properties of surfaces, namely their frequency-dependent reflectivity and absorption of electromagnetic radiation may affect the properties of an electron spin nearby. A spin behaves like a compass needle in a magnetic field; it likes to minimize its energy by aligning itself with the field. How much energy is needed to flip a spin from one direction to the opposite depends on the spin's magnetic moment, and this and its dependence on the electromagnetic properties of materials in the vicinity is what we want to determine. Many of the ideas that people have for quantum computers involve spins that are pointing either one way or the opposite way, thus representing binary numbers 0 and 1 that form the basis of any computer. Practical designs often place such spins on or very close to a material surface. Our project will therefore contribute to finding ways of manipulating such spins in a way that is most advantageous for applications like quantum computers. Another manifestation of quantum particles interacting with material surfaces in their vicinity is the fact that they experience a drag force when moving. Such quantum friction comes about because any quantum system continuously emits and reabsorbs virtual excitations, or quantum fluctuations. If the quantum system is in motion then an imbalance is being created and not all of the excitations emitted can also be reabsorbed. Then these excitations show up as real particles, and the sum of all the momentum lost through their emission causes a frictional force opposing the motion. This usually is a very weak effect, but it increases at close distances and it may become dominant once other types of friction are removed, as is the aim in many modern micromechanical and optomechanical devices. There have been a variety of different approaches to the description of quantum friction, and there is disagreement on both the results and the theoretical methods for deriving them. All of them use purely macroscopic approaches to calculating the frictional force. We want to use our expertise to build a microscopic theory that describes the process of the emission of excitations by moving quantum systems and determine the resulting quantum friction by adding up the momentum lost by the moving object. In this way we want to show how the physical process works and which macroscopic approach is valid under which circumstances.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project deals with fundamental physics at the forefront of current knowledge. It is paving the way for further developments in cold atom physics, quantum information technology, and nanotechnology. In the short term (up to 5 years), it is therefore likely that the impact of this project will be limited to other researchers in these fields, both theoretical and experimental. Commercial impact can be envisaged for the longer term, depending on the speed of implementation of nanotechnology for various potential commercial applications. The project will train one graduate student. The student will acquire a comprehensive education in quantum field theory and its application to experimental situations. He/she will also acquire a wide range of transferable skills, including problem analysis, engagement with researchers from related as well as from other fields, and presentation of research methods and results to other researchers and also to non-scientists. The project will further the professional development of the postdoctoral researcher in an area that is complementary to his/her previous research experience. The project will also contribute to the continued professional development of the Principal Investigator. The general area of research of the project is very captivating for school children and the science-interested general public. The researchers conducting this project will give presentations to various audiences, and will participate in outreach activities by the Department of Physics &amp;amp; Astronomy and the University of Sussex hosting this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>313210</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Brandenburg Technical University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>QFT Cottbus</gtr:description><gtr:id>70AAF0C2-A4A7-4F6E-A71A-741038177F50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Previous publications.

As is well-known, the spin magnetic moment of an electron differs from the value predicted by the Dirac equation because the electron interacts with this vacuum field. The vacuum field can be modified by the presence of a material surface, thus the magnetic moment of an electron near the surface is different from that found in free space. The seminar will consist of an overview of the mechanism of this effect and why it is both conceptually and technically distinct from related effects, followed by a discussion of how it may be observed.

well known to receive corrections from quantum electrodynamics, and the
accurate prediction of g-2 corrections is one of the big successes of
QED. If the electromagnetic field is modified by the presence of a
material boundary nearby, then this also affects the QED corrections to
the magnetic moment. This effect had previously been investigated, but
only for the spin close to a perfectly reflecting boundary, for which
the magnitude of the correction is minute. We have now investigated the
corrections to the spin magnetic moment due to the presence of
imperfectly reflecting surfaces of various kinds: non-dispersive
dielectric as well as dispersive dielectric and metallic ones. We find
that the magnetic moment shift is very different near different material
boundaries, and that, while still very small, it can be several orders
of magnitude bigger than previously predicted on the basis of
perfect-reflector models. The theory of the shift turns out to be
markedly different from that of other cavity QED effects and results of
different models cannot be recovered as limiting cases of each other. We
have explored various methods of calculating the magnetic moment shift.
The standard QED approach of working out the vertex correction is
fraught with technical difficulties; perturbation theory in the Dirac
equation is technically much easier.

Following Huttner and Barnett we model the polarizable medium as a continuum of damped harmonic oscillators and re-phrase the problem in terms of an interacting quantum field theory. We integrate out the matter degrees of freedom (damped polaritons) using diagrammatic techniques and derive an integral equation for the photon propagator, which can be solved exactly in a number of geometries. The formalism allows us to carry out tractable calculations of radiative corrections; we give examples using the multi polar formulation of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics. In particular, we calculate the one-loop correction to the atomic electron's propagator and thereby find the energy-level shift and

modified spontaneous decay rates for a neutral atom close to an absorptive polarizable mirror whose response to the electromagnetic field is anisotropic, i.e. depends on the direction of the impinging radiation.

 the solution of geophysical problems. The atom interacts with the nano structure through the
 quantized electromagnetic field whose mode structure has been investigated in detail. In the
 related geophysics problem a sound pulse is used to probe layered structures in the earth surface,
 but the analysis of the data has hitherto used only very crude models for the sound propagation in
 such layered media. Using the tools developed for the atom interacting with layered dielectric
 media one can improve the analysis of such geophysical data which is of commercial interest and
 currently being investigated together with CGG in Crawley, UK.

Beneficiaries: CGG

Contribution Method: Sound pulses are sent to the sea floor and received after reflection. This is done following a raster
grid. The data is then analysed on the basis of a simple model that assumes sudden reflectivity at
 a layer boundary and constant propgation speed of the sound. However, in reality the system is
 dispersive and the propagation speed changes gradually. Reflection occurs not just at a single
boundary but continuously at all depth. Using the techniques known from the electromagnetic
 mode propagation in layered dielectric media, one can model the acoustic system in a similar
 way and re-use the same methods. This is expected to lead to marked improvement of the
 reliability of the geophysical analysis and hence its predictive power e.g. for oil exploration below

the sea floor.


In free space Quantum Electrodynamics is a highly successful theory that agrees with experiments to very high accuracy. However, in modern nanotechnological applications quantum systems are not found in isolation but interacting with their macroscopic environment. This grant has established new tools for how to do this, in particular for quantum systems near dispersive and absorbing materials. Atoms have been shown to suffer energy level shifts as well as modifications of their decay rates of excited states. An electron has been shown to experience shifts in its inertial mass and its magnetic moment depending on how close it is to a material surface and which electromagnetic properties this surface has. This is important new knowledge for:

* other researchers who seek to manipulate such nanotechnological systems;

* metrology using systems held close to macroscopic media (e.g. in surface traps);

* other researchers seeking to prove or disprove physics beyond the standard model through precision measurements of spin magnetic moments.



The tools developed for this research apply to a wide range of other fields. Currently being investigated and taken further is a link with geophysics, where geophysical layers on the seafloor are probed by analysing the reflection of sound pulses. The analysis of the data genrated in this way has hitherto used only very crude models for the sound propagation in such layered media.

This is important knowledge for the design and exploitation of quantum physics for applications in nanotechnology, metrology, and possibly also future practical realizations of quantum computers. 

When an electron comes close to a reflective wall, its mass and its magnetic moment change by a small amount. Therefore, by choosing the material of the wall and thus its reflectivity one can influence the properties of the electron. However, this effect is normally very small.

Some people look for tiny changes in the magnetic moment of particles in order to prove or disprove new theories of physics, but, as this project has shown, even the currently accepted theories cause a lot of small changes in this and other properties of particles that would first need to be taken into account before any high-precision experiment could make claims about any new theories.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Research on the interaction of atoms with layered nanotechnological devices provides expertise for the solution of geophysical problems. The atom interacts with the nano structure through the quantized electromagnetic field whose mode structure has been investigated in detail. In the related geophysics problem a sound pulse is used to probe layered structures in the earth surface, but the analysis of the data has hitherto used only very crude models for the sound propagation in such layered media. Using the tools developed for the atom interacting with layered dielectric media one can improve the analysis of such geophysical data which is of commercial interest and currently being investigated together with CGG in Crawley, UK.
 Most of this research will feed into further research on how to manipulate nanotechnological systems in realistic environments. In addition there are applications in other fields, for example in geophysics for the analysis of layered structures by using sound waves, which is an important technique e.g. for finding natural resources under the sea floor.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B4239C55-E466-4830-AFE2-BFEB1B1D0C81</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including
