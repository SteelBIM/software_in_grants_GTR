It has been documented across historical time and diverse cultural contexts and is reported with striking regularity when people are asked to describe their social relationships. One reason for this is that ostracism plays a key role in maintaining cooperative behaviour within the group: individuals actively avoid interacting with known cheaters. Ostracism is not always so easily justified however; at times, it is used as a way to isolate individuals who are perceived to be different from the majority.&lt;br />&lt;br />The experiments in this grant will investigate the roots of this complex social phenomenon in development. Drawing on previously disparate literatures in social, developmental and evolutionary psychology, the work will examine the situations under which young children (aged 3-8) exclude others from their interactions. The cross cultural component of the project will test which aspects of children?s social decision making may be culturally invariant and which vary depending on the community children grow up in. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research has the potential to benefit a wide sample of the population beyond academia. It will provide direct benefits for nursery, preschool, and school teachers, as well as for parents and the general public. Furthermore, by providing insights that could be used in translational research on how to increase social inclusion, this work has the potential to indirectly impact upon social wellbeing and cohesion. Below I outline how each of these target groups could, in principle, benefit from my research. In Pathways to Impact, I describe what I will do to maximise the potential impact of this work.

1. Enhancing the research knowledge and skills of preschool, nursery and school teachers 
By investigating why children exclude others from their social groups, this work has the potential to help nursery, preschool and school teachers to understand how social exclusion can arise among the children they teach. If teachers understand some of the causes of social exclusion and isolation, they will be better able to deal with the social problems that emerge within their classrooms and on the playground. By investigating how cultural differences impact upon children's decisions about social exclusion, this work will help teachers develop further sensitivity to how children's cultural background can influence their responses to social conflict. This skill is particularly important within a multicultural society like Britain. 

2. Helping parents to understand their children's social behaviour
In addition to helping teachers to understand social exclusion, this work will help parents to understand the social relationships between their children and their peer group. In doing so, it can enrich parents' understanding of their children's social experiences. 

3. Increasing public engagement with research
Social exclusion is a common phenomenon; as adults, we use and experience it on a regular basis (Williams, 2007). As a result, this research will also be of interest to many members of the general public. As the topic is highly accessible and easy to relate to, it will increase public engagement with research and deepen people's understanding of their own social experiences. 

4. Improving health, social welfare and quality of life
In the longer term, the basic research outlined in this proposal has the potential to inform translational research designed to reduce social exclusion in childhood. By understanding how and why children exclude others, researchers will be better able to design interventions to enhance inclusionary behaviour. We know from previous research that social isolation puts people at increased risk of mental and physical health problems (House, Landis, &amp;amp; Umberson, 1988) and is associated with increases in anti-social and aggressive behaviour (Warburton Williams, &amp;amp; Cairns, 2006). By informing interventions to reduce exclusion the work outlined in this proposal could indirectly enhance health, social welfare and cohesion as well as quality of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243599</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The International Centre for Life in Newcastle developed a new exhibition called Brain Zone (funded by the Wellcome Trust) to introduce children and families to the scientific study of the mind and brain.

For example, I recently gave an invited talk at the University of Yale in which I presented work from the grant and discussed its academic and social impact. I have also given talks at a number of British universities including UCL, Oxford and Cambridge. 

During the course of the grant, I have served on the organising committee for two specialist workshops in my field, one at the University of Surrey and one at the University of Bangor. These workshops were focused on basic research and its applied implications. In the second of these workshops, we organised a special discussion section focused specifically on impact. 

Stemming from these workshops, I and two other Future Research Leaders (Caroline Catmur and Emily S. Cross) recently edited a special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.

My group and I have forged a connection with a regional Science Museum, The Centre for Life, and a number of local schools. We participate in 'Meet the Scientists' events at the Museum in which we seek to increase public understanding of, and participation in, our research. Through our contact with local schools, we have formed working relationships with a number of teachers. These teachers have provided us with valuable guidance in the design of our research and in its possible implications. 

I serve on the advisory board for a new exhibition at the Centre for Life called 'Brain Zone'. The purpose of this exhibition is introduce the science of the mind to young children. I have regular meetings with the Centre and advise them on appropriate content for the exhibition, for example how to explain the importance of social interaction and belonging to young children. 

In order to further enhance public engagement with our research, and keep user groups informed of our findings, we have a lab Facebook page and we send a newsletter detailing our findings to interested parties.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F735DED3-0514-4BC5-BBAF-CB850994AF89</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In line with the original objectives of the grant, I have developed a theoretical perspective emphasising the importance of social belonging in development (and relating it to social exclusion). A single author paper based on this work has been published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B. 

Together with my collaborator (and second mentor on the grant) Ayse Uskul, I have conducted a series of studies investigating belonging and social exclusion in cross-cultural perspective. These studies show that children from an interdependent culture estimate that ostracism is less painful than do children from an independent culture. This cultural difference has important implications for how children morally evaluate the individuals involved in ostracism situations. Children from the interdependent culture punish the perpetrators of ostracism less harshly than do children from the independent culture. A paper based on these findings is now published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (Over &amp;amp; Uskul, 2016). In addition to this, my collaborator Ayse and I recently published a theoretical/review paper on Culture, Ostracism and Social Interdependence in Current Directions in Psychological Science (Uskul &amp;amp; Over, 2017). We have also written a book chapter on this topic that is due to be published in 2017. 

In response to my original ESRC application, my reviewers emphasised the importance of investigating social exclusion within an intergroup context and the ways in which prejudice might encourage children to exclude others. This feedback proved extremely important when my early results showed that children were reluctant to directly exclude individuals within interpersonal contexts. I have taken my reviewers' advice on board and investigated the nature of intergroup bias in childhood and how it relates to exclusion. For example, we have shown that children seek out biased information about social groups such that they prefer to hear information that favours their own group. This has the potential to increase social exclusion through a process of escalating intergroup bias. In a recent paper published in Developmental Science (McLoughlin, Tipper, &amp;amp; Over, 2017), we showed that children dehumanise outgroup members from relatively early in development. I have been invited to write a review paper on the topic of intergroup bias and exclusion that I will submit later this year. 

Over the course of the grant, my collaborators, students and I have published a number of empirical papers relevant to the theme of the grant. Although the studies were not directly supported by ESRC money, I worked on these papers during my fellowship. For example, we published a paper in Developmental Psychology showing that children draw more affiliative pictures when they have been primed with the threat of social exclusion. We have published two papers in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology investigating children's sense of loyalty to the group. In these papers, we show that children are loyalty to the group (in the sense of keeping the group's secret) even when it involves a personal cost and that they negatively evaluate people who are disloyal to the group. We have published another paper, also in the Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, showing that children actively distance their behaviour from outgroup members. In addition to these studies, we have published related work in Psychological Science investigating the situations in which children fail to help others, and a paper in Developmental Science investigating children's understanding of affiliative relationships. 

Taken together, this work provides a substantial theoretical and empirical contribution to our understanding of belonging and exclusion in development.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My ESRC fellowship allowed me the opportunity to reflect on possible applied implications of my research. I will soon submit a grant application, together with Dr. Cade McCall, to develop an intervention to reduce prejudice and encourage social inclusion among children. 

Over the course of my fellowship, I have also begun a collaboration with Professor Stephen Tipper. Together we wrote a successful application to the Leverhulme Trust to use mechanisms of social influence to encourage healthy eating in children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9B31D8CA-FA45-4406-88F5-BB03C7EE3C9A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
