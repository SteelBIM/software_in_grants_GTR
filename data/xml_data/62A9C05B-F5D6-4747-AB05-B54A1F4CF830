In 2006, began work with the rural Wray village community to co-design and then deploy the Wray Photo display (Taylor and Cheverst, 2009). The Photo display proved very popular with residents who uploaded over 1500 photos to the system across a range of categories, with the most popular being hitoric photos. Over the last six years the photo displays have been situated in key settings within the village including: the post-office; the village hall, the village pub (called the George and Dragon) and the village cafe. Feedback from design workshops (and a comments book placed next to the displays) have demonstrated the potential of situated displays and community generated content for supporting sense of community. However, feedback from the community also highlighted the need for tools to provide both greater inclusivity (e.g. for some of the more elderly members of the community) and also for enabling the community to share and co-curate digital narratives (the delightful &amp;quot;The first chips in Wray&amp;quot; story for example) and accounts/collections of local history relating to the village from a range of sources and perspectives. 

The central aim of the proposed research is to co-design these tools with the community and, through longitudinal study, to explore their adoption and appropriation by the community.

It is important that the design of these tools is done in a participatory fashion to help ensure both their appropriateness to the requirements posed by the broad community (given the range of technical abilities for example) and also to foster a greater sense of ownership on behalf of the community. 

Furthermore, a 'one-size-fits-all' tool is unlikely to be appropriate given the range of contexts of use, e.g. curating content for consumption by established members of the village community vs. curating content for consumption by residents new to the village vs. curating content for consumption by visitors. Some tools may be mobile applications that support the capture of content in-situ, whilst others may involve the tailoring of existing technologies within the village, for example modifying the colour photocopier in the village Post Office in order to support the simple scanning of historic village newspaper articles.

In terms of tools to support the consumption of these narratives we envisage that situated displays provide suitable properties and affordances (based on our positive experiences with the Wray Photo Displays). Our experiences with situated displays have taught us that their placement is crucial (e.g. siting the display where the audience has due time to interact) and again needs to be done in collaboration with the community in order to promote sense of ownership and avoid inappropriate placements. But we also consider mobile tools as candidate technologies for supporting the consumption of locative media, e.g. enabling a member of the village, out on a ramble, to learn about the historic places she approaches. This could be through a push or pull based approach and involve viewing or listening to the narratives relating to the place. It is anticipated that while consuming such narratives, users will also wish to be able to respond, e.g. contributing stories/narratives of their own or by suggesting links with another related place or narrative.

The project will provide valuable insights into the potential of digital tools and mobile/display based technologies to support the shared curation and consumption of local history. While the deployment domain is that of a rural community, we anticipate that many of the gained understandings and guidelines gained through the work will be transferable to other place-based communities, and a workshop will be held inviting researchers working with other communities to compare their experiences and findings and so and so provide a suitable forum to support the cross fertilisation of ideas. 

Other beneficiaries of the work will include the HCI research community in general but particularly those involved in the areas of: community and community generated content, mobile and situated display based technologies and methodologies for 'Research in the Wild'. Indeed, the proposal's explicit aim to co-design and implement an appropriate exit strategy should provide valuable understandings in this under-researched area. Social science can also benefit from 'Community of Practice' data.

Impact summary (commercial private sector)

Impact to the commercial private sector will be supported by the School's KBC (Knowledge Business Centre). One area of potential impact is with digital signage companies such as Amscreen, a company which KBC is currently engaging with. Amscreen is the U.K.'s largest 'Out of Home' media company and we are confident that opportunities for utilising findings from our research with the company will exist and that, given the excellent support facilities offered by the KBC, these opportunities will be maximised to the full. We also anticipate that the mobile tools developed under the project will have clear commercial impact potential and Infolab21 houses a number of SME companies that specialise in mobile application development.

Impact summary (third sector)

The cultural heritage aspects of the proposed research can have significant impact within the museum sector in the medium to long term. We envisage that the shared narratives curated through the project will provide a readily graspable example of a novel and engaging form of 'exhibit' that could provide an exciting complement to the traditionally curated pieces found in museums.

Impact summary (wider public, nation's health and culture)

A key societal challenge is that of supporting sense of community and, in this proposal, we aim to explore how mobile/situated display based technologies and associated tools might foster sense of community within a rural village community. We believe that the insights gained from this work will have significant generalizability and potential to help strengthen community cohesion. 

In terms of positive benefits towards the nation's health, the positive relationship between sense of community and subjective well-being (SWB) is presented in (Davidson and Cotter, 1991) who, in summary, state: &amp;quot;Sense of community was significantly related to SWB in all three samples. The effects were especially pronounced for the happiness facet of SWB&amp;quot;. The results of the proposed research have significant potential to provide insights that, if taken up by appropriate policy makers, could provide positive impact on the nation's community cohesion (and consequently positive impact on the nation's health).

The project also has clear potential for contributing to the nation's cultural heritage (and fostering engagement in this cultural heritage by the wider public) by exploring ways of 'opening up' the shared collection and curation of content relating to local history. In the short term, the project will impact on residents in Wray (and visitors to Wray) by encouraging reflection on the village's cultural heritage. While in the longer term, positive results gained from the research can be transferred to other place-based communities, initially other towns and villages within Lancashir</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>284378</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote at CHIItaly 2015 entitled: Experiences of Supporting Community Interaction Through Situated Display Deployments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF406952-8194-41F5-87DB-36C0844C54D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote at CHIItaly 2015 (Rome) entitled: Experiences of Supporting Community Interaction Through Situated Display Deployments</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sapienzaapps.it/chitaly2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at British HCI Lincoln in July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B4679B2-B7F4-4617-A2C3-91278D8FF733</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of full research paper &amp;quot;Content Analysis of a Rural Community&amp;sup1;s Interaction with its Cultural Heritage&amp;quot; at the British HCI conference held in Lincoln in July 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://british-hci2015.org/program/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presentation (entitled: The 'hacking of third places' within a Rural Village Community) at international workshop on Human Computer Interaction on Third Places, Vancouver, 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9CE798B6-66B1-4866-86E9-FE1A39E51350</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presentation (entitled: The 'hacking of third places' within a Rural Village Community) with follow-on discussion at international workshop on Human Computer Interaction on Third Places, Vancouver, 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hci3p.com/dis/accepted-submissions/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presentation at HiCUE Workshop on Human Interfaces for Civic and Urban Engagement, Zurich, 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3212B66F-7F06-4CFD-9C0C-214BA83956EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presentation (entitled Supporting a Rural Community's Interaction with its Cultural Heritage: Design and Use of a Situated Display based solution) with follow-on discussion at the HiCUE Workshop on Human Interfaces for Civic and Urban Engagement, held in conjunction with UbiComp 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hicue2013.blogspot.co.uk/p/schedule.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;campus in the city&quot; public engagement event in Lancaster City Center</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AA1803C-B5E9-4DCA-9010-10D8DC9F3BC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In May 2016 the project engaged with members of the public as part of a &amp;quot;campus in the city&amp;quot; public engagement event in Lancaster City Center (on 14 May 2016).

The developed SHARC framework has been used effectively to communicate with stakeholders and prototype locative media experiences in not only the rural village of Wray but also the city of Lancaster and the English Lake District.

The research with the City of Lancaster involved collaboration with Lancaster Military Heritage Group and Lancaster's Kings Own Royal Regiment museum. The SHARC framework has been used to prototype both self-guided experiences in the town and experiences designed to compliment a human tour guide.

The research that has taken place in the English Lake District has involved extensive collaboration with the Lake District National Trust. Field trials involving apps developed using the SHARC framework have been carried out with members of he general public and the positive results have led to continued interest from the Lake District National Trust and strong visitor engagement (with the Cultural Landscape of the Lakes) supported by the app and co-designed locative media experiences are currently being further developed in collaboration with the Nation Trust's World Heritage Site Programme Manager with a view to potential licensing of the developed apps and further public roll-out within 12 valleys in the Lake District. One reason for this further roll-out being the anticipated positive impact in tourism revenue and National Trust membership that locative media applications may promote.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD631E17-B975-4EDA-B6B3-3A15A24E3DF9</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In terms of software, we have developed the SHARC locative media framework comprising a web-based application and an android application that enables non-technical users to design, develop and share locative media experiences (such as walks that navigate defined Points of Interest and Events of Interest which themselves have associated media items) relating to the cultural heritage of their home towns or the Cultural Landscape of their natural places.

The locative media produced using the SHARC web application can be downloaded and experienced by users via the SHARC mobile application which runs on Android based smartphones. Furthermore, users can respond to the experience through the same mobile application by submitting their own media, such as photos, audio comments, etc. The requirements and content used for driving the development of the framework have arisen from our longstanding work with the Wray village community and more recently, collaborations with the Lake District National Trust and Lancaster's Military Heritage Group and King's Own Regiment museum.

A key design decision when developing the SHARC framework was support for off-line use and this has proved valuable across our field trials of Locative Media Experiences in the three main settings of: Wray, Lancaster and the English Lake District. It should be noted that even in Lancaster, where data connectivity is available, the support for off-line access to media content stored on the mobile device has been effective in supporting a more engaging and immersive visitor experience (i.e. one in which the user is not required to wait for video content to be buffered on the device etc.).

The empirical data from our field-trials have produced important findings for interaction design such as the potential of locative media to support visitor engagement with the cultural landscape in nature settings and the hosting of workshops supported through the SHARC project have helped foster a research community around this area. The findings from the project have also highlighted the potential to utilise locative media experiences to compliment rather than replace the human tour guide experience.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings can be taken forward by practitioners of Interaction Design through the publicised design guidelines for developing locative media experiences across a range of settings. 

We are currently exploring the commercial licensing of the SHARC framework (or parts thereof) and this is being supported through a 5K 'impact grant' awarded by Lancaster University. We are currently working closely with the Lake District National Trust in order to further develop/refine the SHARC framework prior to commercial licensing.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB482A95-A7F2-4472-B952-980929F17723</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://thesharcproject.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Our work on public displays and citizen engagement with Wray village is featured in a report (coordinated by Swansea university) currently (Nov 2014) in the contributions section of the written-evidence for the Speaker's commission on digital democracy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F0223B08-2CB8-418C-830A-60C4CE999443</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/commons/the-speaker/speakers-commission-on-digital-democracy/publications/written-evidence/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The SHARC Locative Media framework provides web-based and mobile authoring tools allowing non-technical designers to create locative media experiences.
