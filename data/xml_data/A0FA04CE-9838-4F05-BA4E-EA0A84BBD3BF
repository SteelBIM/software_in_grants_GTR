testing and computational modelling</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K018221/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the United Kingdom, and throughout the world, tunnelling in urban environments is essential to provide necessary infrastructure. Further, major infrastructure projects, many of which will require tunnelling, will be likely to increase with continued urbanization. However, tunnelling can place buildings at risk. Therefore, reliable assessment tools to predict tunnelling-induced damage are essential to determine whether protective measures are necessary. Useful models exist for predicting tunnelling-induced damage, but these methods need refinement, making use of new and existing data and increasing computational resources. 

The primary aim of this proposal is to obtain the necessary experimental data to improve analytical and computational methods of predicting tunnelling-induced settlement damage. Specifically, this will be achieved through three primary steps. First, centrifuge testing, in which small scale models can be used to investigate full scale structures, will be used to evaluate the interaction of the soil and the structure during the tunnelling process. In particular, realistic scale models will be 3D printed and the tunnelling process directly simulated. Second, these physical tests will be simulated computationally, to evaluate and improve computational methods. Third, additional simulations will allow extension of experimental results to a wide range of tunnelling scenarios.

The experimental and computational results will be directly used to create improved analytical and computational guidelines for predicting tunnelling-induced settlement damage. These guidelines will be evaluated with respect to existing field data. It is envisioned that these results will have an immediate impact on the tunnelling industry in the UK and around the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Global plans for infrastructure expansion are substantial, and will play a significant role in the global economic recovery. Due to urbanization, tunnelling will play a vital role in infrastructure development. Tunnelling in urban areas poses a significant risk to existing infrastructure, particularly older buildings. Tunnelling-induced damage has huge economic implications, both in direct damage repair and related insurance premiums. 

Thus, better methods of predicting damage could have a significant impact by reducing costs and litigation related to tunnelling-induced damage, and by informing appropriate damage prevention measures. Specifically, the engineering community would benefit from procedures which can be used to better predict damage. Further, contractors, insurers, and property owners would benefit from improved certainty related to the effect of tunnelling on nearby buildings. There are also significant societal benefits in having better defined methodologies for prediction and prevention of building damage due to tunnelling projects. Public confidence in the engineering assessment of potential building damage is important, and must not be neglected. 

These benefits are directly relevant to the UK, where underground infrastructure is expanding. This is evident in the Crossrail project (to be completed by 2018), for which 21 km of twin bored tunnels are planned under central London. Similarly, for the Thames Tunnel project, 25 km of bored tunnel is also proposed along the Thames River. Furthermore, the planned HS2 high speed rail project, and expected high speed rail expansion in coming years, will continue demand for tunnelling and excavation in urban areas. Therefore, the need to better predict the building damage which may be caused by these (and future) major construction projects is paramount.

In addition, international expansion of infrastructure will affect the UK economically. UK companies have an established expertise in tunnelling and excavation work, which is continually being sought by rapidly expanding countries in Eastern Asia and around the world. Globally, current and future tunnelling projects total an estimated $220 billion of work, through which the tunnelling industry will play a significant part in global economic recovery. It is crucial that this UK expertise is not just maintained, but continually expanded.

Significant past research has been conducted in this field, providing a solid foundation on which to interpret new results. Thus, unlike many research studies, impacts on industry practice are foreseen in a relatively short timescale.

In summary, this work would have an immediate impact for planned construction projects in the UK, but also for expected future infrastructure expansion in the UK and around the world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>343586</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Arup collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>E812FEF6-B8FD-4556-9CAF-DE99014E5069</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two MEng theses (one of which is yet to be submitted).

Thus far, the dissemination of our findings through a workshop in London generated significant interest from industry, and has generated numerous disussions regarding how damage predictions could be improved in industry. We are in the process of developing simplified guidelines to suggest such improved methods. We still have funding through November to complete this work. 

Additionally, our findings have primarily contributed to new knowledge, and to have been used internally to improve both experimental and computational modelling procedures.

- Quantified the effect of building characteristics (e.g. building length, number of openings, building position) on level of damage of the building through an extensive centrifuge testing campaign . 

- Used physical centrifuge modelling to investigate three-dimensional effects of soil-structure interaction during tunnelling, and specifically to define the region of influence of the soil structure interaction. This is an importance parameter needed to improve existing methods applied in industry. 

- identified key parameters to create effective computational models using the result from physical centrifuge tests. 

- evaluated the importance of building weight on the soil-structure interaction and damge during tunnelling.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have collaborated with Crossrail and industrial partners (Arup), who will hopefully directly use the results of our work. 

We organized a workshop for industry and academia in London (April 18, 2016), that disseminated our findings. 

We are currently doing additional simulations to develop improvements to the simplified assessment procedures regularly applied in industry.
