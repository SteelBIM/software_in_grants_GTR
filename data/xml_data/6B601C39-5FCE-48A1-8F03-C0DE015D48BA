The growing suspicion that it allows undesirable non-citizens to undermine the State's ability to deport has led to rapid and far-reaching legislative changes. These concerns are the contemporary face of older discourses regarding the nature of belonging and citizenship, which have long presented foreign men and migrant families as particularly problematic.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research considers the experiences and legislative treatment of non-citizen, 'deportable' men in relationships with British/European women. Using a combination of documentary analysis and qualitative fieldwork with deportable men, their partners and practitioners in the field, the project pushes the boundaries of knowledge in a number of critical areas:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>migrant men's negotiations of deportability in the context of having family ties&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the impact of immigration rules on family members who are not subject to migration control&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>changing official constructs of the family and 'genuine' relationships in immigration contexts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the use of gendered rhetoric in migration management. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>In addition to its conceptual contributions, the project will generate empirical data urgently needed to inform policy discourses on family migration, citizenship and deportation.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit:
Impact outside of academia is integral to this research, from ensuring its optimal design to delivering lasting outcomes. There are a wide range of potential beneficiaries. These include those the research focuses on - deportable men (DM) and their families - as well NGOs and advocates working with such men, judicial figures practicing in family and immigration law, and employees of the private companies running Immigration Removal Centres (IRC). Policy implications will be of interest to parliamentarians and public sector representatives, including at the Home Office, UK Border Agency (UKBA) and the Department for Education and Skills. Other potential beneficiaries include international organisations, such as the Council of Europe, International Organization for Migration and the UN High Commission for Refugees, teachers, the general public and media. 

How they will benefit: 
The project has three main areas of impact and participation:
1. Advisory Board: the close involvement of DM and experts working with them is key to ensuring the research is effective and ethical. An advisory board of such individuals will provide input at all stages of the project. Confirmed members include the private-sector manager running an IRC in London, the coordinators and directors of several key NGOs, and three migrant men, one of whom has spent many years in detention. I am also in dialogue with a UKBA representative about her joining the advisory board but she has not yet been able to confirm her participation. In addition to helping ensure that the research is conducted in a way that maximises impact potential, membership of the Advisory Board will offer practitioners the opportunity to forge links with the Academy, an opportunity furthered by participation at the final year symposium. Advisory Board membership will have particular benefit for certain individuals, including the three migrants, who will be supported to participate fully and engage theoretically with issues that they have first-hand experience of. 

2. Dissemination of results: In order to ensure the long-term impact of the research, the PI will produce policy and good practice recommendations, practical advice and informed media messages. The dissemination routes will include:
i. NGOs: discussion of policy implications with advocacy organisations and best practice recommendations with key support NGOs. To include presenting at major NGO conferences.
ii. UKBA: several one-on-one and at least one group meetings will be held with strategic UKBA representatives. The PI will host a COMPAS Breakfast Briefing (held with policy-makers) in London and will work with the RA to participate in relevant policy consultations.
iii. Parliamentarians: communication with the All Party Parliamentary Groups on refugees and migration, and the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
iv. General public: the PI and RA will write short and accessible pieces for strategic digital resources, internet discussion groups and newsletters. The PI will also participate at the Bristol Festival of Ideas.
v. Media: the PI will write a piece for a non-academic journal such as the Economist and approach print and broadcast media to galvanise interest in running stories on family deportability. Bristol University's Press Office will facilitate further media contact.

3. Informing interventions: the long-term impact and outreach of the project will be assured using a practical engagement strategy focusing on encouraging better provision for detained fathers. Unlike in prisons, there are no schemes in IRCs to help detained men maintain relationships with their families. The PI will engage with prison and IRC welfare officers to facilitate lesson sharing on establishing support mechanisms, such as piloting family-friendly visitor sessions. The PI will also work with NGOs to recognise the importance of supporting ex-detainees reintegrate with their families, including through family mentoring.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218644</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Danish National Centre for Social Research (SFI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Knowledge exchange with SFI Copenhagen</gtr:description><gtr:id>31607C4B-E560-4C88-ABD0-5818FE734092</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work in progress seminar</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>I presented early project plans with a number of SFI colleagues, who provided critical early feedback on the project.

In addition to speaking to established academics and building invaluable professional relationships with others working on related issues, I was able to inform a group of very engaged and interested Masters students, about an area of migration studies that they were largely previously unaware of. I also invited three of my London based participants to attend in order to have the opportunity to hear and influence research that they were part of. The discussion sparked by my presentation was extremely stimulating and a group of us (both interviewees and academics) continued it long after the seminar finished. In addition to providing an opportunity for meaningful accountability, and invaluable feedback and questions, the seminar led to plans with two separate academics for joint publications on areas of shared interest.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Time and Migration workshop, Stockholm</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>80AEFF94-54E2-4A46-A1DE-FA9025B6AC3E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to give a paper at the small Time and Migration workshop that Rueben Andersson organised at Stockholm University in September 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited to jointly lead the Bristol Detention Campaign inaugural meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F9328E2-687A-4520-B9BC-DBACC9CCCCFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to jointly lead the inaugural meeting of a group of volunteers and activists that went on to establish the Bristol Detention Campaign, organised around campaigning for the end of immigration detention.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-convener for panel &quot;Undisclosed research and the future of ethnographic practice&quot; (EASA Conference, Milan, 22 July 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>16C0D629-47A5-4D8E-BEC7-B897A7315F5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-convened the panel with others of the Anthropology of Confinement Network.

My words were also subsequently quoted by Baroness Hamwee in the House of Lords, during the Lords' debate over the 2016 Immigration Bill.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://detentioninquiry.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/immigration-detention-inquiry-report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1180F837-180A-4821-BF62-45EFC1666F55"><gtr:id>1180F837-180A-4821-BF62-45EFC1666F55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: Boundary Making and the Broad Ripples of Immigration Enforcement</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/83C9D8B8-E500-4269-862C-CB9FC5667E6C"><gtr:id>83C9D8B8-E500-4269-862C-CB9FC5667E6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: The deserving detainee?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F0BA7C30-477B-4A15-8AFC-BC6E1554CF19"><gtr:id>F0BA7C30-477B-4A15-8AFC-BC6E1554CF19</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: Gendering the Irregular</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8FD5976D-1DF0-4D48-95BC-7F081B98DE32"><gtr:id>8FD5976D-1DF0-4D48-95BC-7F081B98DE32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: Love, Legality and Masculinity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FC6A148D-3981-4F64-8176-56CB5476994C"><gtr:id>FC6A148D-3981-4F64-8176-56CB5476994C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Migrant Men and Citizen Partners: Detention, Deportation and Mixed Citizenship Families in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/140193A3-6D30-47A3-8259-0D30169941F0"><gtr:id>140193A3-6D30-47A3-8259-0D30169941F0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: Immigration detention in the media: anarchy and ambivalence</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0"><gtr:id>7618f8a2f0b4593c430b03c60c2580f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Griffiths, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/901383EC-E0A2-48F5-924B-A2EECB251949"><gtr:id>901383EC-E0A2-48F5-924B-A2EECB251949</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blog post: The Home Office should stick to its own policy -
