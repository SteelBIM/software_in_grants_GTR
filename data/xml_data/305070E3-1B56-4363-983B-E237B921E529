The enzyme responsible for the first step in this process, Rubisco, does not work at its potential maximum efficiency at the current levels of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. If levels were much higher, photosynthesis would be increased and plant productivity would be higher. There is an immediate requirement for increased crop productivity to provide food for the rising population of the planet. Our project addresses this problem. We are studying a mechanism present in unicellular green algae that results in high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside their photosynthesising cells (called a CO2- Concentrating Mechanism, or CCM), enabling Rubisco to work at maximum efficiency. During the initial CAPP1 programme, we discovered important new information about this mechanism, and using new and rapid methods we have identified novel algal genes and additional regulatory components which allow the CCM to operate in association with a specific micro-compartment called a pyrenoid. We have also successfully introduced some of these components into a model higher plant, Arabidopsis, and also successfully introduced a modified form of Rubisco which may facilitate aggregation into the pyrenoid. The ambitious goals of the CAPP2 extension will be to combine the expression of the CCM and pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant. Firstly, we will continue to identify genes required by the algae to achieve high concentrations of carbon dioxide inside the cells, and develop new markers and sensors to reveal the location and activity of these genes when expressed in the higher plant. Secondly, we will identify additional regulatory elements needed to form a pyrenoid, as well as exploring the impact on Rubisco enzyme efficiency and light utilisation. Thirdly, we will continue to introduce successive components into our model Advanced Plant so as to &amp;quot;stack&amp;quot; up the activities of CCM components and examine the extent of pyrenoid formation and enhanced productivity associated with the CCM. This work will provide new insights into how plants and algae acquire and use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, of great importance in predicting and coping with the current rapid changes in the atmosphere and hence in climate. The work will also contribute to strategies to increase global food security, because it will indicate new ways in which crop productivity can be increased.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The CAPP2 programme will continue to discover and characterise new components of the Chlamydomonas CCM, in addition to known bicarbonate pumps and carbonic anhydrases, and identify regulatory elements, protein modifications, linkers and chaperones needed to aggregate Rubisco into a pyrenoid and progressively incorporate key components into Arabidopsis. Our approaches include:
1) Identify and characterize components of the Chlamydomonas pyrenoid, including growth phenotyping, complementation to identify the mutant locus and fluorescence tagging to identify pyrenoid-associated proteins. Pyrenoid defects will be screened from microscopy, Rubisco kinetics, CCM physiology and light use.
2) Pyrenoid structure, assembly and regulation will be defined using block-face scanning EM in Chlamydomonas and Advanced Plant chloroplasts. Chaperones and linkers will be identified using analytical ultracentrifugation and Blue Native PAGE, and other post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and S-S bond formation by LC-MS/MS.
3) To assemble a pyrenoid in the Advanced Plant, gene cassettes will be assembled and/or stacked into delivery vectors for transformation. Additional known CCM components will be introduced and location tested by fluorescent tags, and levels of untagged components by polyclonal antibodies. Repression of all native Rubisco in Arabidopsis double mutants and CCM characteristics will be combined in a single plant.
4) The Advanced Plant lines will be characterized physiologically to determine effectiveness of introduced CCM.
5) A FRET nanosensor will be developed to allow bicarbonate pools accumulated through the CCM to be visualized.
6) Modelling of inorganic carbon accumulation and effectiveness of pyrenoid operation will be undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at UIUC Illinois.
7) A central repository of genetic tools and materials will be developed for open access to the scientific and commercial communities.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

The idea to develop a series of farms across India to teach women techniques from factoring climate into crop choice to improving yield is part of a programme to empower mid-career that saw 20 female scientists from India brought 23 delegates to visit the labs and lecture halls of Cambridge this week. 

Experts in plant and crop sciences from Indian and Cambridge exchanged skills and ideas during a five-day programme that included seminars, workshops and visits to laboratories.

Female scientists from across India applied to take part in the programme, with the first 20 staying at Clare College for a week and attending workshops on topics from building negotiation skills to delegating more effectively. According to the programme organisers, this was in order to help them &amp;quot;handle the juggling game of science and family&amp;quot;.

The visit included a tour of the Sainsbury Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, the Innovation Farm at the National Institute Of&amp;nbsp;Agricultural Botany (NIAB) and the John Innes Centre (JIC). Ultimately, it is hoped that the Innovation Farm concept will also be developed at universities and research institutes across India to train women farmers in the latest agricultural techniques.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CCM9: The IXth International Symposium on Inorganic Carbon Utilization by Aquatic Photosynthetic Organisms</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CFB4AEB1-ABFB-4F36-A7B0-E94DB0D62A77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organisation of major international symposium and edited volume of outputs</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/research/howardgriffiths/ccm9</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in Cambridge Forum for Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6B47B0E-2666-4D2C-819E-577ACF11E73A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Forum aims to stimulate cross-disciplinary conversations about some of the great sustainability challenges the world faces in the future and the research pathways which will help to prepare for and address those challenges.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cfse.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in popular science radio programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02D110A8-6D62-4696-A821-427AEFB215DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science week Debate on plant processes attended by schoolchildren, increasing interest in subject areas</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.thenakedscientists.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cambridge Conference on Global Food Security 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A4FE7EC7-1CA8-4EC2-9226-A6A04F832F9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Conference was held on 23-24 June 2016 co-hosted by Cambridge Global Food Security, the Centre of Development Studies, and Cambridge's conservation networks: the Cambridge Conservation Initiative and Forum, and the University of Cambridge Conservation and Research Initiative.
