The aim of this project is to use some IoT technologies in a sensor network system to prove that the concept is better for environmental sensing. Mountain environments are among the most sensitive to climate change, and the Cairngorm Mountains contain some of Britain's most vulnerable habitats. The trials will be carried out within an area which is already being monitored by researchers from the University of Dundee and thus has an ideal combination of scientists and challenges to test the technology. 
IoT inspired sensor networks offer a revolutionary new way of investigating the environment. By embedding sensors into the landscape, many remote or hazardous environments can be measured &amp;quot;live&amp;quot; for the first time throughout the whole year. Seasonally variable processes combine to control the evolution of this vulnerable environment, with peat desiccation, deer grazing and wind erosion being important in summer, combined with snow melt and runoff and frozen ground processes. 
Wireless sensor networks have already been used for environmental science. Over the last few years a number of small-scale sensor network projects have focused on a range of environments, and these have shown that systems tailored specifically to Earth and Environmental Science needs generate the most useful data. However they have traditionally been very research based and difficult to manage. The next phase in sensor network research is to revolutionise their user friendliness and interoperability in order to increase their use by environmental scientists. 
However an IoT inspired sensor network does not simply mean adding WiFi to everything. Power use would be too high and the radio frequency normally used in IoT gadgets is too high for a wet environment for example. This is why the project has to carry out research in tuning the new technology for environmental monitoring.
The potential outcomes and measures of success of this project will include 
1) Proof that IoT inspired wireless sensing systems have major advantages for environmental science.
2) Measures include: deployment time/ease, battery lifetime, ease of administration and fixing
3) A proven IoT-inspired environmental sensing system that will help future researchers develop the next generation of sensor networks for other environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will provide technology capable of collecting the data that are needed to underpin the careful management of landscapes and biodiversity in National Parks and other conservation areas, including hazard management, and can also be deployed in relation to hazards in populated areas and industrial landscapes. As such it has a wide range of potential stakeholders within the land and resource management arena, recreation industries, and those engaged with industrial installations. On the international level the work will help to produce deployable systems for monitoring climate change and its effects, while having the adaptability to monitor ecological and hydrological systems in more remote (and often less developed) parts of the world. 

This work will help to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of environmental sensor network developments. The UK has been a pioneer in this new field and UK companies have benefited from the opportunity to develop this research commercially. The wireless sensor network research community will also benefit.

The methods for disseminating data/knowledge/skills to an academic audience include publication of papers in academic journals, and conference presentations including organising special sessions. In addition there will be a number of public engagements with science activities:
a) An application will also be made for inclusion in the Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2014. 
b) Press releases aimed at the public and environmental sensing companies.
c) Networking within UK agencies and conservation NGOs to disseminate the pilot study results and develop further interest in deployment at other locations.
d) Maintaining a Practitioner's Wiki for information exchange among researchers involved in new developments for Environmental Sensing.

The increased use of Environmental Sensor Networks (ESNs) is essential. However a lack of standards and low usability are recognized as factors holding back take-up. The drive towards Internet of Things devices does not solve these issues directly but provides a rapid development of technologies which will benefit ESNs. The impact of addressing communication standards and user friendly maintenance could lead to a step-change in their use. This in turn will provide a huge boost to Earth and Environmental Science as more areas can be measured and studied in detail - providing the essential data we need to monitor major effects such as climate change but also fundamental science insights.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>143525</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Southampton University collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>C07E500E-13CA-4AA4-9A74-CE69B33BDC4F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reported elsewhere by project team members - conference papers intended to form basis of published papers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Technical and research expertise regarding the Internet of Things and also geomorphic processes in a periglacial environment.
