However, robots still find it hard to carry out stable force control tasks on uncertain objects or walk on natural soft terrains (grass, sand, mud). Just like the difference between the way we use the left hand and the right hand can not be explained using their biomechanical basis alone, the answer to robotic survival in uncertain environments does not come from an attempt to build robots that resemble human bodies alone. From early 1980s, scientists have begun to believe that the secrets of stable interactions with natural compliant environments will come from an ability of the robot itself to be compliant. The original work of Neville Hogan on impedance control was based on this concept. Since then, a considerable body of literature can be found on how impedance control is applied in various force control applications such as rehabilitation, massaging, bipedal walking, exoskeletal robotics, and several other direct interactions with humans. However, still there is no answer to how impedance control should be adaptively managed to sustain stability when the coupled dynamics between the robot and the environment evolves metastable dynamics. The theory of Metastability states that an uncertain dynamics system can exhibit intermittent instability though it may stay stable most of the time. A human using a screw driver is one example, where the dynamic contact with the screw may stay stable most of the time, but exhibit intermittent slipping due to uncertainty in the friction between the screw and the surrounding medium. Even a human walker can fall down in rare situations due to the same phenomenon. However, an uncertain dynamic system can enhance stability if it can predict where it is likely to fail. A number of recent advances in metastable systems use the concept of mean first passage time (MFPT) as an indicator to assess the current control policy in an uncertain environment. MFPT is the expected time to the next failure situation given the current knowledge of the uncertain dynamics of the coupled dynamics of the robot and the environment.Therefore, this project aims at developing a unifying theory of impedance control for robots that are in dynamic contact with uncertain environments. The generic method that can start to perform stable hybrid position/force control on an uncertain environment with partially known dynamics and recursively build a robust internal model to perform stable position/force control on an environment that changed its stiffness, viscosity, and inertia. Then an algorithm will be developed to use a locally linearised model of the above coupled dynamic system to estimate the MFPT of the robot and the environment. This MFPT will then be used in a novel real-time algorithm to adapt a bank of candidate impedance parameter sets and adaptively choose the best parameter set to suit the environment in order to maximise the MFPT. Rigorous theoretical proofs of stability and experimental validation of methods will be given. The project will use a custom built experimental platform to evaluate and refine the fundamental theories and algorithms that will be developed in this project. The PI will closely collaborate with Shadow Robotics Company, a UK based SME who develops biomimetic robotic hands, and the robotics group led by Professor Darwin Caldwell at the Italian Institute of Technology, where the researchers strive to enable the humanoid robot i-Cub to interact with natural uncertain environments. Therefore, this project will benefit from a wealth of experiences the collaborators have already gathered on real robots interacting with natural environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Industrial Impact: The proposed real-time adaptation of internal impedance to suit the external uncertain environment will have a broad impact on humanoid robotics in general, because stable interaction with uncertain environments is a major bottleneck in this area. The PI will closely collaborate with Shadow Robotics, a UK based SME specializing in Dextrous Hands that offer the possibility of constructing a robot with the same manipulation abilities as a human, which could be operated remotely to perform a task deftly and safely. Their customers include NASA, Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute, Hughes Research, and a range of top university research groups across the Globe. This has led to work with ESA, CERN and CDE. As mentioned in the letter of support, Shadow Robotics group believes that a fundamental breakthrough in adaptive real-time impedance control on an uncertain object will significantly improve their competitiveness. Therefore, the proposed work will be carried out with regular communications with the team at Shadow Robotics in order to serve the most crucial technical and implementation needs in the industry. Academic impact on robotic manipulation and locomotion: The advancements in the area of adaptive impedance control to manage metastable dynamics arising out of dynamic interaction between a robot and an uncertain environment will open up new research opportunities in both manipulation and locomotion. Moreover, it will give useful insights to conduct research in the area of human motor learning. Professor Darwin Caldwell's robotics group at Italian Institute of Technology was chosen as the academic collaborator because his group is playing a pivotal role in a number of European humanoid robotics project like the C-Cub project in addition to several other EU funded research projects. The PI's close interaction with his group in the recent past has lead to a common agreement that a focused effort to develop a unified theory on adaptive tuning of internal impedance of robots will help to make a significant advance in direct robotic interaction with natural environments. Regular skype meetings with his group will be continued in order to exchange academic ideas. We will make a joint effort to maximise impact by organising seminars and workshops in international conferences. Social impact: Through periodic participation of workshops with mixed audiences such as the meetings of the Strategic Promotion of Ageing Research Capacity (SPARC), human adaptive mechatronics (HAM), and those organised by the Welcome Trust, we will establish a dialogue with potential broad beneficiaries of robots that will directly interact with humans. We will learn from them and try to extend our methods for stable robotic interaction with uncertain environments to suit their broad safety needs. Student population: We will develop a separate set of simple experiments for undergraduate students to internalize the fundamentals of robotic interaction with uncertain environments, impedance control, and adaptive learning. The PDRA will be given broad training to develop such experiments and to develop text to support students. This will be a strong addition to his/her CV when it comes to applying for academic positions at the end of the contract. Open access for UK students in general: At the end of the project, we will plan to open the experimental set up for registered UK students (free of charge) to remotely log in and conduct experiments on adaptive impedance control on the promise that the published results will be freely made available on the internet. This effort is to stimulate a wider interest in robotics and to provide a free platform to test initial ideas before applying for grants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97667</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Italian Institute of Technology (Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia IIT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with the Italian Institute of Technology</gtr:description><gtr:id>243258CE-665B-4433-AB64-61B54FFAADBF</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>It lead to the development of a robotic legged walker with soft continumm legs.

We asked two simple questions from the students, and following were the answers:

Did this visit make any change in the way you view science and research? If so, can you write a couple of lines about it?

Olivia: &amp;quot;This trip has changed the way I view science as I saw how with new technology we can build amazing robots out of very small materials&amp;quot;.

Maya: &amp;quot;It made me think about how much can be made from very little and how robotics can help people, for example for medical uses&amp;quot;.

Genevieve: &amp;quot;Yes, because I thought research was just about chemicals and biology&amp;quot;.

Bernice: &amp;quot;Yes it did because science can also be creative as well but I thought it was just about researching and medicine, but the trip showed me it's much more than that&amp;quot;.

Do you think it is worth doing robotics research like what we do at King's? If yes/no, can you mention your thoughts?

Shazu: &amp;quot;Yes, I would like to research robotics because we will use it in the future&amp;quot;.

Afrina: &amp;quot;Of course, it is definitely worth doing robotics research because you can find out information which you probably didn't know. At King's College we saw a robot which you had to programme and it did what you told it to do&amp;quot;.

Bernice: &amp;quot;Yes I think it is worth doing robotics research because we will be using robotics for lots more things in the next generation&amp;quot;.

Callum: &amp;quot;Yes, it would be so cool to be able to build robots like those we were shown. I loved the trip and I liked looking at all the robots. 5-stars!&amp;quot;

Anonymous: &amp;quot;We can use robots to do some of the human jobs in the near future&amp;quot;.

Maliha: &amp;quot;Yes because that's how we get ideas to invent things and learn new things even about our everyday life, things that we don't already know&amp;quot;.

Shabbir: &amp;quot;Yes because at King's College you can replicate body parts for people who have lost parts of their body&amp;quot;.

Tyreese: &amp;quot;Yes because it's important to know more about robotics and technology and how they work&amp;quot;.

Maya: &amp;quot;Yes because it's amazing to show how much you can do with robots&amp;quot;.

Anonymous: &amp;quot;Yes because it's amazing to see what we can do with technology&amp;quot;.

Thrishantha Nanayakkara, Katie Byl, Hongbin Liu, Xiaojin Song, &amp;amp; Tim Villabona, &amp;quot;Dominant Sources of Variability in Passive Walking&amp;quot;, IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pp. 1003-1010, 2012



1. By conducting numerical modeling and experimental evidence for the first time, this paper presents the possible sources of variability in the dynamics of legged locomotion, even in its most idealized form. 

2. Here, we show that the dominant source of steady state variability of passive dynamic walking is due to nonlinear interaction between the distribution of the coefficient of friction and restitution with the collision dynamics, and not simply due to geometric variations more typically modelled in terrain. 

3. Our results suggest that stochastic ground collision models should play an important role in the analysis and optimization of dynamic performance and stability in robot walking.

Armas Fernandez, Valerio Pereno, Jelizaveta Zirjakova, Allen Jiang and Thrishantha Nanayakkara, &amp;quot;Adaptive Internal Impedance Control for Stable Walking on Uncertain Visco-elastic Terrains&amp;quot;, pp. 2465 - 2470, 2012 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems October 7-12, 2012, Vilamoura, Algarve, Portugal.



1. Analysis shows that the computational challenges of robust walking on uncertain visco-elastic terrains can be reduced by investigating different combinations of internal and external impedances.

2. Given the impedance of a terrain, memory primitives of steady state variability of states of locomotion (contact force distribution and distribution of angular speed at each foot collision) can be used to choose an internal impedance of the walker in order to passively migrate to a desired steady state variability, without any control.

1. Effect of granule shape for granular jamming: Cubes work better than spheres in terms of hysteresis and variability of stiffening and relaxation cycles.

2. Effect of granule size for granular jamming: Smaller is better in terms of hysteresis and variability of stiffening and relaxation cycles.

3. Effect of granule stiffness for granular jamming: Stiffer granules provide higher rigidity when jammed, but softer granules provide better hysteresis and variability across stiffening and relaxation cycles.

4. Properties can be combined to create composite granules, such as stiff cubes with a soft outer layer. This composite granule improved hysteresis over purely stiff granules and improved rigidity over purely soft granules.

5. Coupling the membrane to the granules can improve hysteresis as well.

1. A statistical controller that uses a real-time estimate of probability of grip failure on an uncertain object can maintain stable grip on a randomly pulsating object without prior knowledge of its properties.

2. A safety factor can be implemented into the controller to provide a general bias to close the grip than relaxing the grip.

3. Developed a simulated model for the controller and its interaction with uncertain objects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Social contributions:
