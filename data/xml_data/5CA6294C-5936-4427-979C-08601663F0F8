This involves thinking about the dynamic and creative ways in which authority is fostered and how it contributes to community life. The need to think about authority and how it operates is timely, as traditional authority structures are seen to have been eroded and there are calls to reinstate these (e.g. after the riots of summer 2011). Recent years have also seen a movement of authority away from the state and into the hands of private organisations such as credit agencies, disability assessors and other &amp;quot;big society&amp;quot; organisations. Policy moves (e.g. the Localism Act) that threaten existing state-led structures have exacerbated the need to think about new ways of understanding and building the social aspects of contemporary life, and provide alternatives to the state-community-individual model. The erosion of trust in traditional authority (family, banks) continues and contributes to these concerns. The ARN has worked together for 3 years, organising symposia, conference sessions, retreats and writing a special edition of the Journal of Power, an article for Critical Inquiry and a pamphlet on authority and participation to be used by community practitioners and participatory researchers.
The core network consists of early career academics working at Universities of Brighton (Leila Dawney), Bristol (Naomi Millner, Tehseen Noorani), Plymouth (Julian Brigstocke) Warwick (Claire Blencowe), Paraiba, Brazil (Aecio Amaral) and Bath Spa (Sam Kirwan). The project will extend this network to academic and non-academic participants working both in the UK and in Latin America, where similar concerns are being investigated in community and local political settings and where there is potential for research development and cross-fertilisation of ideas. The project builds on the work undertaken during 2 previous AHRC projects and takes up themes identified during these projects to build durable collaborations with new partners.
The project will involve two symposia: &amp;quot;spaces and aesthetics of authority&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;the making of the common&amp;quot;. The latter explores the notion of the &amp;quot;common&amp;quot; in philosophical and theoretical writings, in order to consider the role of knowledge and authority in the production of a shared life. The former emerges from a previous AHRC network project where a focus on the experience of authority was found to be central to understanding how it works and how it is generated through performances and practices (Dawney, Blencowe et al. 2011). 
The symposia provide an opportunity to get to grips with new concepts and collectively produce workable ways of using those concepts in research practice which will lead to the development of a major participatory research project. They will feed into two retreats, which will provide time and space for creative thinking, collaborative writing, engagement with texts and the development of concepts and approaches. These will be supported by a creative writing expert and a visual artist to facilitate the production of creative, communicable material to be used in the larger research project and by colleagues working in community settings. 
Having found their methods successful for their own career development, the ARN are keen to promote their distinctive working methods (retreats, diagramming and collaborative writing) to PhD students. The project will therefore include events at doctoral training centres (e.g. ESRC funded doctoral training centre network). 
These activities will be supported by an intuitive webspace that enables discussion and peer review and provides a platform to archive, collect and disseminate creative and academic work that will form the beginning of a clear area of study called &amp;quot;new authority studies&amp;quot;. This will prepare the ground for the development of a significant research project that explores new articulations of authority in community settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact 1: Policy makers, community practitioners and embedded researchers will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to both promote and foster forms of authority that work as a force for cohesive, resilient communities, and to resist those elements that may prove destructive. This will take place by developing an intellectually rigorous and theoretically informed understanding of the workings of authority in various social settings, as well as its changing and new articulations.
Impact 2: Academics will be better equipped to produce high-quality collaborative and participatory research through adoption of and experimentation with creative methods for concept development and for communication across academic boundaries, and between academics and non-academics.
The work of the ARN has identified a need to revitalise debates about authority in order to understand new and emerging forms of community life, non-dominating power and the democratisation of expertise, particularly in the context of the rolling back of state structures. The ARN has already made a significant contribution to theoretical and critical knowledge about authority and community production. This project will enable the movement of this knowledge from the academy into community settings through engaging with academics working with communities in the UK and in Latin America, and through recruiting community partners in order to develop a large-scale multi-sited research project investigating the diverse articulations of &amp;quot;new authority&amp;quot; in community and activist spaces. The project will create capacity for community organisations through focusing on the role that local knowledges can have in building community, and on actions that build and nurture authority as positive non-dominating power, as well as highlighting new marginalisations and new forms of domination that may emerge from the devolution of authority. Community partner meetings will feed into project development aiming to build capacity locally through experimenting with practices, knowledges and resource relations that produce and foster non-dominating authority relations.
Knowledge produced through this project can be drawn on by academics working with community partners, and will be communicated through 2 pamphlets, a website, a conference paper and 2 research papers. These will be distributed to colleagues working in community settings, on CCs projects, in Brazil, from community-university partnership programmes (CUPP, Univ. of Brighton) and contacts made through the activities of the network. Through these forms of dissemination, the project will act as a catalyst for new thinking about authority and community engagement. The emerging subdiscipline of 'New Authority Studies' will have an impact upon researchers in the humanities, social sciences and elsewhere.
This project contributes to the ongoing impact agenda by building bridges between theory and empirics and taking philosophical and theoretical concepts outside of the academy. It will provide a model of how theory can move into community settings through creative approaches such as diagramming, slow thinking and creative writing, and will be communicated to other academics who are wary of &amp;quot;crossing the bridge&amp;quot; between theoretical and community-focused research. Emerging researchers will be encouraged to adopt these ways of working and to participate in knowledge production through the 7 doctoral college talks. The ARN has historically used these methods as a means of developing theory and conceptual ideas, and this project moves this agenda forward by working with a creative writing practitioner and a visual artist to develop materials (self-published pamphlets) for participatory, experimental projects that will have a direct impact on both policy development and on the lives and practices of those people and places involved in this research. Pamphlets will be produced in both English and Portuguese.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>32939</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Babochka is an exhibition of photographs taken by Laurie Griffiths and Jonty Tacon.

The session abstract is below
The changing composition and size of state and household debt burdens in the UK, and the different histories of high indebtedness in other countries and regions, has sparked growing interest in the ways in which debts compose space, time and experience, and in how, on a broader scale, the being-in-common of the anthropocene is, and has been, conditioned by indebtedness. However, we still know relatively little about geographies of debt and indebtedness, both in terms of how they shape specific performances of the everyday and the connections, differences and thus comparative possibilities between different national, regional and local milieu. We invite contributions that explore geographies of debt and indebtedness, whether through economic, political and/or socio-cultural registers. We are particularly interested in papers that:

 Investigate the different methods and strategies for creating and governing indebted subjects;
 Unpack how debts intersect and interact with other obligations and social relations (e.g. class, gender, ethnicity, age, dis/ability);
 Explore how debts transform attachments to objects and material cultures;
 Map the new cartographies of urban environments shaped by promises of easy credit;
 Examine the intersections of credit/debt relations with the movement and immobilities of different bodies, objects, categories and borders. 
We are particularly keen for contributions focusing on non-UK contexts. 
The session was attended by over 30 participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Emergent Authorities and the Making of the Commons International Symposium, Joao Pessoa, Brasil: 29 to 30 June 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1CA1E089-DA73-41BD-B249-744EA9489CF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This symposium took place in Joao Pessoa, Brazil in June 2015.

This has resulted in burgeoning academic and community partnerships, a prospective visiting fellowship at the University of Brighton, 3 new PhD students who are specifically engaging with the work of the ARN, as well as broadening and deepening the many relationships with community partners that members of the network are developing. The funding has not only enabled the members of the network to bring expertise and practice produced during the network's intensive theoretical retreats and symposia to bear on the work of partner organisations, but it has enabled an iterative approach of feeding back into the theoretical and academic spaces of the retreat by community partners working for social change in British, US and Latin American contexts. This to and fro of knowledge exchange has allowed deep partnerships to develop and opened up pathways for more extensive cross-fertilisation of expertise. 

Collaborations with Raza Youth Collective and the Democracy Center have involved engagement with work produced by the network, in a series of intensive reflexive encounters which have encouraged both partners to adopt some of the creative and collaborative methods undertaken by the ARN. The Democracy Center has found that this has led to a greater understanding of the role played by the individual members of the team in the work that they do, and to a more open and supportive working culture . The Raza Youth Collective found that their participation and engagement with ARN's texts helped them to reconsider the methods for participation adopted by the organisation and think about how members of all ages can be active participants in activities and decision making processes. 
Ongoing partnerships with community organisations including the Dublin Tenants' Association and The Bristol Hospitality Network have enabled the creative practices of participation, collaboration and slow thinking to enter new spaces outside of academia, and have also fed into the way in which the ARN works to develop impactful, theory-led partnerships and develop practices of knowledge production that empower, challenge and provoke critical engagement. More recently, Dawney's collaboration with the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre, and with photographers Laurie Griffiths and Jonty Tacon have drawn directly on the new ARN work on hope, and is developing a large scale research project exploring the creative and community approaches to nuclear decommissioning. 
 
The ARN has continued to post proceedings of discussions, conference panels and meetings on its website and this has led to a significant increase in requests for partnership and collaboration, particularly from Latin America. Millner has recently formed a partnership and secondment to the the Mesoamerica Community Forestry Project, working with the NGO Bioversity International on developing impact pathways. This include making a film about the cultures surrounding community forestry and the challenges being faced in terms of land politics, and collecting oral histories around sustainable conservation practice before those concepts existed. 
In Mexico Millner worked women's groups working using the diverse economies framework, for example some running a 'Cambalache' free shop setup where goods are exchanged and skills shared without the exchange of money.

The pamphlet &amp;quot;problems of participation&amp;quot; continues to be downloaded from the website. A new pamphlet, Problems of Hope, is currently in production and will be available to be downloaded from the website in the coming months.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FF293AA8-AE33-445C-B9F8-452ED5597010</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The two themes of the network, &amp;quot;emergent authorities&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;making of the common&amp;quot; have enabled deep conversations to develop between academics working in Europe, the USA and Latin America.

The &amp;quot;emergent authorities&amp;quot; theme has been expanded both within the network in terms of new theoretical work on political spirituality and on ritual, which have led to the development of the publication &amp;quot;Problems of Hope&amp;quot;, and to a new teaching programme at the University of Warwick on mental health and community engagement, supported by an institute for advanced teaching and learning grant. It has also led to new collaborations between Dawney, Blencowe and Kirwan on debt and the authority of money, which has involved a Leverhulme Fellowship and an internally funded research grant at the University of Brighton. 
 
Ideas connected to the theme of the &amp;quot;making of the common&amp;quot; have materialised as a recently published collection on the commons (Space, Power and the Commons, Routledge), edited by three members of the network, which has in turn led to a university funded PhD at the University of Brighton on this subject, and two new PhD students. Th project has enabled the network to set out a clear manifesto for the commons and for commoning and has shared this with colleagues and presented this work at conferences. This has fed into the Spatial, Cultural and Environmental Politics Research Centre at Brighton, where an event on commons and commoning is currently being planned. 
 
During the first retreat in Sussex, creative methods for theory-building were developed that have helped the network think about the ways in which forms of contemporary power influence our experience of everyday life. This in turn led to our experimenting with ways of communicating these ideas to student and non-academic audiences. This has fed into a pamphlet produced through a related grant (participation's others). A a sister edition of this entitled &amp;quot;Problems of Hope&amp;quot;, specifically related to the work undertaken in this project is currently in production. A dissemination and engagement programme will be then developed in future projects and through the networks that have emerged from this project. In the second research retreat (Brasil), the idea of the commons; was focused on more strongly, and the members of the ARN set out a clear set of definitions of the commons that can be used to provoke a productive set of debates and practices and will be communicated to other academics, activists and community partners. This has also fed into a university funded PhD studentship and a new masters' level module on community engagement at the University of Brighton. In addition, this work adds new critical dimensions to work currently being undertaken by engaged scholars in community settings on the commons and practices of commoning, and this is currently being disseminated through scholarly publications including the recent Routledge collection edited by three network members: Space, Power and the Commons. This has already received much interest and new collaborations are currently being planned that draw on this knowledge and bring it to community settings in the production of co-produced research that aims to build on existing ways of being and working together. 

The networking project aimed to develop durable collaborations. Currently one member of the Brazilian network is planning a visiting fellowship in the UK and another UK-based academic has made two follow-up trips to Brazil, and has gained travel bursaries in order to deepen these collaborations, and has applied for AHRC funding as a result of these networks. The networking project has expanded the range of partners that the Authority Research Network work with exponentially. The combination of theoretical retreats and externally facing co-produced research has proved highly beneficial as a means of cross-fertilising knowledge and as a way of ensuring that research is impactful and responds to the needs of partner organisations. One pamphlet is currently in preparation in collaboration with a visual artist, which will explore the concept of hope in the context of these partnerships and provide an accessible publication that will be available free of charge to interested people and organisations. These will then be used in future workshops with community partners as a means of developing future research collaborations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As we move forward with the project we are developing research collaborations with community partners. In particular Dawney is working with the Lithuanian National Drama Theatre and photographers Laurie Griffiths and Jonty Tacon to develop a large research project on nuclear decommissioning, communities and creative practice. This is drawing directly on the text from the forthcoming Problems of Hope pamphlet. 
Outcomes from the symposia (blog posts, pamphlets) are feeding into research development meetings over the course of the project, and the expansion of the network will enable a broader audience for the work that the network is doing that provides a critical and wide-ranging account of emergent forms of authority in contemporary settings. 

Community partners are already reflecting on their own practice with reference to conversations and publications produced by network members, including the RAZA youth project and Democracy Centre. Over 50 doctoral students who have attended our doctoral training workshops in the UK, Brasil and the USA, and community partners have shown a willingness to reflect on their own practice will adopt the network's focus on intensive spaces for thought. Dawney's PhD students are drawing on the creative practices of the ARN in the development of research methodology and events for research students and academic and non-academic colleagues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D3BCFE86-ABF3-42AD-8178-D17B43CE444B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative
