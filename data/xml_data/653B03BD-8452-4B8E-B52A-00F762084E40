New technologies, increased urbanisation, and the ageing population have all had a profound impact on the way we interact with each other, the implications of which have yet to be fully understood. The proposed research project aims to investigate the influence of social relationships, in a contemporary Britain, as a potentially malleable target for changing and improving the course of mental health and wellbeing throughout the lifespan. Relying on available data from two UK nationally-representative cohorts, and using a life-course approach, this project will examine social isolation and loneliness, cyber harassment, and childhood bullying victimization and will cover mental health and wellbeing from childhood up to midlife. More specifically, analyses will be conducted to (1) generate a profile of loneliness in young adults by looking at their overall wellbeing, mental health, education levels, employment and living circumstances (NEET), and physical health; (2) map &amp;quot;hotspots&amp;quot; of loneliness among young adults, mental health problems, and provision of mental health services in contemporary Britain; (3) examine childhood predictors of social support in adult life and test the buffering effect of social support on mental and physical health at midlife; (3) study the extent of cyber harassment among young adults and test its independent effect on mental health and wellbeing, over and above other forms of victimization; (5) explore the long-term impact of childhood bullying victimization on mental health service use from childhood to adolescence and up to midlife; and (6) estimate the associated individual and societal costs. 

Childhood bullying victimization is common among youths: according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), one in three children report having been bullied at some point in their lives, with 10% to 14% experiencing chronic bullying lasting for more than six months. It is not surprising that bullying and cyber harassment are the main reason for young people contacting online support services such as Child Line and YoungMinds. This project will engage key stakeholders in considering solutions for reducing individuals' suffering and the burden of bullying victimization on mental health across the lifespan. It will also engage the government and policy makers in considering the individual and societal costs of bullying victimization in the UK. Furthermore, the UK has being described in the press as the &amp;quot;loneliness capital of Europe&amp;quot;. According to the Office for National Statistics (2014), UK residents' satisfaction with their social lives is lower than the EU-wide average, and the percentage of the population with access to supportive social relationships is the third lowest of all the 28 EU nations. This project will resonate with the public's concerns around risk associated with developing poor social relationships and finding solutions on how to address these problems from an early age. This project will impact on research by generating new discoveries, exploiting innovative technologies, and maximizing valuable existing data resources. This project is cutting-edge, investigating the emerging topics of youths' loneliness and cyber harassment. Findings will impact interventions and clinical practices by potentially unraveling loneliness and cyber harassment as significant influences on mental health and wellbeing. Ultimately, this project may indicate that positive social relationships represent a target for prevention and intervention strategies. Helping youth developing and maintaining supportive relationships with their peers may be an efficient pathway to promote mental health and wellbeing and also build resilience.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research and leadership activities outlined in this proposal lay the bases for promoting and better recognizing through different mechanisms the importance of mental health and wellbeing in the UK society today. The leadership activities will shape current mental health research and influence its future through funding, partnerships (national, international, and interdisciplinary), capacity building, and public engagement. The research programme will lead to an increased understanding of the negative or positive influences of social factors on mental health in the digital age. It will impact science and policy through publications in high-impact journals and discussions with stakeholders and policy makers. We anticipate several different groups will benefit from the proposed activities via various pathways: 

Pathway 1 - Creating a synergy with different research opportunities, partnerships, and new technologies 
The scientific community will benefit from this programme of leadership activities. The proposed activities will create opportunities for a wide range of mental health researchers via new funding schemes, clearer pathways for career development, exchanges with academics and stakeholders from various backgrounds, and greater dissemination of their research through creative public engagement activities. A consideration of new technologies and exciting unconventional partnerships will facilitate the gathering of valuable data that would be otherwise impossible to collect. Researchers, mental health professionals and stakeholders will benefit from exchanging new findings and ideas during the academic meetings.

Pathway 2 - Shaping the funding landscape of mental health research 
The creation of an ESRC mental health portfolio will benefit UK research councils including the MRC, Wellcome, and BBSRC with a harmonisation of funding opportunities across councils. Researchers will also take advantage of targeted calls for proposals. Junior academics will gain from funding schemes targeting people at the stages of their career. 

Pathway 3 - Advancing knowledge through scientific breakthrough 
Through the publication of empirical evidence on the impact of social relationships today on mental health and wellbeing, a range of people will benefit from the research programme proposed here. Increased knowledge will benefit researchers by generating new discoveries and suggesting original hypotheses. The conclusions emerging from the research activities will be relevant for policy makers who shape the UK health and education systems using evidence-based recommendations. Mental health professionals will also benefit from the identification of frequently occurring, malleable social risk factors influencing mental health and wellbeing across the lifespan. 

Pathway 4 - Facilitating communication across disciplines and with stakeholders
Various stakeholders will engage in the leadership activities and they will benefit from accessing new research, opportunities to influence the direction of mental health research, as well as increasing communication with academics. The synergy produced around mental health research will create a platform for researchers from various disciplines to generate ideas and collaborative projects. 

Pathway 5 - Engaging with the public about mental health and wellbeing
Via a series of innovative, engaging, easily accessible and activities, the general public will gain from this proposal by discovering and learning about mental health and wellbeing and accessing evidence-based information. Young graduates may make career choices in mental health following such activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>513560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/P010113/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9A6079E0-357B-44DA-80F9-C5953586BD0C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Developmental psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>544E9837-9640-4AAB-93EB-416962206DD9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education and School</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DA22549B-026D-41FC-9204-F0CC6913B24D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Health Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
