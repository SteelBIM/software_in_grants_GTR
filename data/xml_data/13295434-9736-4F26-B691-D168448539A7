The team will investigate the importance of adverse early life experience in `programming&amp;iquest; exaggerated responses to pain and stress in adulthood in pigs, the mechanisms by which programming is expressed, and whether it can be over-written. Studies on several species, including humans, indicate that programming has wide-ranging deleterious health and quality of life consequences, attributable to re-setting responsiveness of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) stress axis and neuronal responsiveness to noxious stimuli in spinal cord. We will use two early life challenges relevant to modern pig-farming, social mixing of pregnant gilts (which is stressful, and as we have recently shown, programmes the offspring&amp;iquest;s HPA axis) and neonatal tail-docking (which is painful). We will study their effects, alone and together, on emotional behaviour, stress responses, and pain sensitivity of the female offspring as juveniles and adult sows. Quality of life methodologies will provide an integrated assessment of the effects of these early life experiences on pig welfare. The behaviour and welfare studies will be complemented by genetic analysis, stress hormone (salivary cortisol) measurement, and post-mortem studies of gene expression (quantitative in situ hybridization in the hypothalamus and limbic brain for mRNAs coding proteins proposed to regulate HPA axis and emotional and behavioural response to stress. The project will provide new information about pain sensitivity after pre-natal stress and tail-docking, evaluating their long term consequences, and analyse expression of key genes involved in processing pain in the primary nociceptive relays in the spinal cord. The CNS gene expression studies will both provide quantitative markers to corroborate the whole animal studies, and dicate potential therapeutic targets for overwriting programming or prevention by selective breeding. We will also investigate potential genetic markets of susceptibility to adverse programming by analyzing the genetic basis of stress reactivity in a commercial pig breeding population, which may point the way to a programme of behavioural genetic selection. Complementary studies on laboratory rats will enable more detailed analysis of underlying mechanisms. To model the prenatal stress that programmes piglets, pregnant rats will be exposed to social defeat stress and both stress and pain responsiveness will be evaluated in the adult offspring. This will include, for stress, testing HPA axis responses to specific physical and emotional stressors, as well as measuring emotionality in a novel environment; measuring brain expression of CRH-related peptides, urocortins, and receptors which are considered important in stress responsivity. Pain sensitivity and gene expression patterns in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord will be compared with controls, especially considering proteins involved in NMDA receptor/complex-mediated synapses. As maternal HPA axis stress responses in pregnancy are naturally reduced by actions of neuroactive steroids (produced enzymatically in the brain from progesterone), the importance of this mechanism in protecting the fetuses will be tested by blocking synthesis (with finasteride) before stress to evaluate which offspring are more adversely affected. We will investigate whether neuroactive steroid (allopregnanolone) treatment reduces stress or pain responses of prenatally programmed rats. This will also be tested in pigs, to attempt to overwrite the adverse programming. These studies may identify selective targets that could potentially minimize early life adverse programming by means of either pharmacological/molecular or breeding plan intervention.

The aim of our work in pigs was to examine the possible welfare consequences of two early life challenges: prenatal stress (as a consequence of maternal social stress during pregnancy) and early postnatal pain (due to tail docking; the removal of part of the animal's tail to prevent them chewing or biting each others tails). Both social mixing of pregnant sows and tail docking are common practices within the pig industry and investigating their impact on animal welfare is of practical importance. 



Social mixing of young sows, pregnant for the first time, with older larger sows produced higher than usual stress levels (indicated by an increase in stress-related hormones). This maternal stress produced a variety of negative effects in the offspring at various stages of their lives. Prenatally stressed pigs were found to show a greater pain reaction to tail docking. Their immune system also develops differently which means they could be less healthy than other pigs and the research found altered levels of brain receptors critical to stress and fear processing, which could mean they are less able to handle stressful situations. From a farm production point of view, these pigs were also found to have a reduced growth rate after they were weaned from their mother, and some changes to reproductive physiology, both of which could reduce the efficiency of production and have a negative effect on farm finances. When they were kept through to reproductive maturity themselves, prenatally stressed sows were also found to show poor quality maternal behaviour such as shifting posture a lot, or lying in positions that made it difficult for their piglets to feed. When kept in a loose farrowing system this caused a tripling of piglet mortality.



In summary, it appears that prenatally stressed pigs do not cope well with many of the normal challenges (tail docking, weaning, mixing and giving birth) they face in a farming environment. Prenatal stress may be an underlying and unappreciated cause of poor welfare in commercial pig production. This study has advanced our understanding of this issue and suggests alterations to farm management that could help alleviate the problem.



Within the project we also investigated emotionality in pigs. Specifically, the validity of different ways of assessing fear in pigs was examined; for example we looked into the method Qualitative Behavioural Assessment and how it can be used to identify behaviours shown by fearful pigs. This work could greatly improve the quality of information that such tests provide and could contribute to better assessment of the emotional consequences of prior experiences in pigs.



Piglets showed signs of behavioural distress immediately following tail docking, which can be lessened by giving the animal a local anaesthetic first. However, tail docking did not affect the pigs' response to painful or non painful stimuli in the long-term and there was no evidence of on-going chronic pain as an effect of docking. In fact there were relatively few long-term consequences of tail docking. However, reproductive development in both male and female pigs was found to be affected by the procedure; male pigs which had gone through tail docking had smaller testis and both sexes were found to have lower levels of the hormone oestradiol. While we do not know yet why this is, it could be significant for both pig farming and even for human reproductive biology. Tail docking remains a controversial practice in worldwide pig production and the acute behavioural evidence supports the suggestion that it is painful. Although there appears to be no long term effects to their sensitivity to pain pigs could experience other more subtle and far reaching consequences which could have implications for farm production efficiency.



Finally, given that aggression can lower welfare either directly or indirectly through prenatal stress, we explored the genetic basis of aggression. This was investigated by looking for associations between genetic markers and behavioural aggression. We found that aggression has a complex genetic basis with a large number of markers all contributing a small amount to the trait. Although there may not therefore be single genes that individually have a large impact on aggressiveness it was possible to identify important chromosomes containing genetic variation for aggression. Information such as this could one day contribute to efforts to reduce the negative welfare consequences of aggression through genetic selection for less aggressive pigs in commercial production.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8334535D-4EE0-4EAA-A6DE-27FCD2C17654</gtr:id><gtr:sectors/></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1EEE1654-42CC-48BA-A915-9576C225585E"><gtr:id>1EEE1654-42CC-48BA-A915-9576C225585E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Development of a mechanical stimulator and force measurement system for the assessment of nociceptive thresholds in pigs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of neuroscience methods</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/28a5ce8349cf0a4ef587a89b6d88e981"><gtr:id>28a5ce8349cf0a4ef587a89b6d88e981</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sandercock DA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0165-0270</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B049A301-ADA7-49A4-87E0-0827C3BA1E94"><gtr:id>B049A301-ADA7-49A4-87E0-0827C3BA1E94</gtr:id><gtr:title>Farm animal welfare: assessing risks attributable to the prenatal environment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Animal Welfare</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/72936fdf002f1dd70400c1d228895ad6"><gtr:id>72936fdf002f1dd70400c1d228895ad6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rutherford K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CF7B69F2-C20F-4119-9863-7270C06740BA"><gtr:id>CF7B69F2-C20F-4119-9863-7270C06740BA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Association of HPA axis-related genetic variation with stress reactivity and aggressive behaviour in pigs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMC genetics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/984a63ff1ae7694c0d120ecada23f3ff"><gtr:id>984a63ff1ae7694c0d120ecada23f3ff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mur?ni E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1471-2156</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A9D47616-1FDD-475B-9366-59B6F84074F9"><gtr:id>A9D47616-1FDD-475B-9366-59B6F84074F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pre-natal stress amplifies the immediate behavioural responses to acute pain in piglets.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biology letters</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ed4950c3223f8de8e953749b26343b39"><gtr:id>ed4950c3223f8de8e953749b26343b39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rutherford KM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1744-9561</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/21D7239E-40D6-4A13-B451-75B4CC3351B6"><gtr:id>21D7239E-40D6-4A13-B451-75B4CC3351B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Effects of early life stressors on reproductive capability in pigs</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/86efda48fe91f9ff035be8e8257b2811"><gtr:id>86efda48fe91f9ff035be8e8257b2811</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>C Ashworth (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C7550FBC-260D-4F5E-8FB8-4DDA8D0EBB6E"><gtr:id>C7550FBC-260D-4F5E-8FB8-4DDA8D0EBB6E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The impact of prenatal stress on basal nociception and evoked responses to tail-docking and inflammatory challenge in juvenile pigs.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Physiology &amp;
