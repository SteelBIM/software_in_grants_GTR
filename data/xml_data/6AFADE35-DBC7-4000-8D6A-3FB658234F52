Investigators from RiHN working with the Ministry of Defence's Defence Medical Services organisation propose to lead a specialist workshop to explore a new compelling area of research, exploring the potential of Re-Distributed Manufacturing (RDM) in deployed operations. This encompasses the application of new RDM-related technologies and systems (e.g. Bioprinters, Additive Layer Manufacturing) in expeditionary military and civilian emergency and humanitarian operations.

Re-Distributed Manufacture (RDM) is defined as: &amp;quot;Technology, systems and strategies that change the economics and organisation of manufacturing, particularly with regard to location and scale&amp;quot; . In healthcare, RDM involves bringing production closer to the point of clinical need or use and enhancing the capability to deliver personalised medicine. RiHN is leading an agenda to advance the impact of UK medical manufacturing research. 

Whilst RDM includes the notion of a shift from centralised towards decentralised production, extant research continues to assume a degree of stable environmental conditions and fixed static location (e.g. hospitals/clinics/home). However, RDM can deliver life-saving benefits in mobile medical scenarios, where there is urgent and unforeseen demand in changing and remote locations, such as in response to natural disasters and emergencies (e.g. recent Ebola crisis), and the rapid treatment of soldiers in battlefield scenarios. This often requires a reverse supply chain perspective, starting with the requirement based on patient need. There are a variety of medical conditions that could benefit from rapid response treatments in deployed operations, these include and are not limited to blast injuries to skin and tissue, haemorrhagic shock, and bone and muscle repair. 

The EPSRC funded workshop aims to: &amp;quot;review and identify applications for RDM in deployed operations and create an agenda for delivering R&amp;amp;D pathfinders that will radically transform medical treatments and patient outcomes&amp;quot;. The workshop provides an opportunity to (a) define both medical and manufacturing requirements, and (b) take stock of UK R&amp;amp;D capability in this specialist area. It also provides a unique forum for learning and exchange between civilian and defence organisations. In order to authoritatively explore the potential of RDM in this emerging specialist area, the team will engage a range of experts and stakeholders, to include key decision-makers in MoD, emergency medicine practitioners, and researchers in medical engineering. 

The RiHN team will use the outputs of the workshop to inform a future funding proposal, which will set out detailed justification for specific target areas for investigation, as well as research leads and partners who will implement these studies. Where relevant, this proposal will consider RDM applications (civil and defence) that will benefit from Early Supplier Involvement (ESI) and Innovate UK/Catapult involvement in the development of products and services that have the potential to transform healthcare delivery to front line services. Relevant insights will also feature in a wider RiHN white paper offering guidance to healthcare stakeholders for future RDM in healthcare R&amp;amp;D investment.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In summary, during a series of sandpit and workshop events, run by the RiHN, the potential value of implementing RDM approaches in deployed, frontline operations was identified. Working with MoD Defence Medical Services (DMS), members of the RiHN team seek to open up a new line of investigation that has the potential to radically transform support to medical treatments in deployed operations, where there is urgent and unforeseen demand remote and changeable locations. The workshop will allow us to bring together a number of key experts and disciplines and advance a robust, structured agenda for further research with the aim of advancing the UK's capability in RDM and delivering impact to clinicians, practitioners and patients. This agenda will help shape how MoD, defence prime contractors, emergency services and UK Research Council proceed with future R&amp;amp;D investment and resourcing. 

Beneficiaries include SMEs and defence prime contractors (suppliers of 3D printers and scanners, and manufacturers specialising in customised parts and therapies), clinicians within the NHS and MoD Defence Medical Services, who will define requirements and will be end users of new technologies and and systems that will allow the rapid, tailored and localised treatments of life-threatening and debilitating injuries, resulting in better patient outcomes. If there were a significant adoption of RDM, soldiers would receive an enhanced level of critical care when it is most required, which has the potential to reduce complications and long-term care costs incurred by the Ministry of Defence.

Clinicians operating in deployed operations often have to administer treatments in extreme conditions, facing needs that may help define future take up by the NHS. The practice of emergency and military medicine can be employed to evaluate novel healthcare approaches, and identify where RDM can add the most value in healthcare delivery. 

Finally, the academic community will benefit from the workshop, which brings together those from diverse backgrounds to investigate applications beyond the mainstream clinical settings. For those from the social sciences, this will allow them to explore the role of lead users in shaping novel manufacturing technologies and systems, and an improved comprehension of the diffusion of disruptive innovations. For those from engineering and science, they will be provided with an insight into the working environment and issues of emergency and military medicine. All academic participants will have the opportunity to explore and critique their ideas leading to proposals investigating the feasibility of RDM applications.

RiHN is well connected to key researchers in engineering and management, centres of innovative manufacturing, and specialists in military and emergency medicine - ensuring effective participation, dissemination and exploitation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11792</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P010660/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>16595C3C-600D-4AD2-B394-16E06F96495F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Med.Instrument.Device&amp; Equip.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A759BB04-AFFE-4780-BD31-9A2707BC44BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical Imaging</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BDA5E012-C5EA-48C7-B1D8-594821FDC78E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Operations Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
