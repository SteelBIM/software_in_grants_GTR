SLI involves problems with talking and with understanding spoken language. These difficulties are usually not transient. However, there is limited information about how these children ?turn out? in adulthood. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap. It is based on the Manchester Language Study, the largest UK study of individuals with a history of SLI. The original cohort was a random sample of all 7 year old children who were attending language units in England in 1995. These individuals will be between 23-25 years of age during the investigation and longitudinal data is available at 7, 8, 11, 14, 16 and 17 years. A range of areas of functioning will be examined in adulthood, in the personal, social and societal domains. For example: general health (exercise, diet), personal relationships, education, employment, finances, and civic participation (voting, volunteering). Quantitative as well as qualitative data will be gathered via direct assessment, participants? self-reports, reports from significant others, and consultation with national records. The project will make use of the concurrent and longitudinal data to identify pathways to positive adjustment (resilience) as well as risk pathways to maladjustment in adulthood.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>798607</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RALLI Youtube Channel - http://www.youtube.com/rallicampaign</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D92847F-C506-4DFA-921B-30881F60E4CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 200,000 views of the Channel by November 2014

This public lecture presents information on the developmental trajectories of emotional and social difficulties in individuals with SLI from childhood to adolescence. Do children with SLI experience more social difficulties as they grow up or do these difficulties diminish with maturity? What do we observe across time in the case of emotional difficulties? The talk then focuses on specific aspects socio-emotional development examining anxiety, depression and in particular quality of friendships in adolescence. The talk will end with implications for policy and practice.

A recent analysis of research publications and grants confirmed this impression, showing that SLI attracted far less research funding and led to fewer publications than many other conditions of comparable frequency and severity (Bishop, 2010). Perhaps the most striking comparison was with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is of similar prevalence to SLI. Between 1985-2009, there were 1,140 publications on SLI in Web of Science, compared to 12,631 on ADHD. Between 2008 and 2009, funding was 19 times greater for ADHD than for SLI.

Having identified the problem, the question was what to do about it. At the end of 2011, we decided to take action, and formed a group with the name RALLI, standing for Raising Awareness of Language Learning Impairments. Our group consists of four academics, two of whom trained as speech and language therapists (the PI Gina Conti-Ramsden, Professor Courtenay Norbury and two as clinical psychologists (Professor Dorothy Bishop, Professor Maggie Snowling), together with a practising speech and language therapist (Becky Clark). We received invaluable guidance from a Public Relations company, Teamspirit, who contributed pro bono advice and expertise to get the campaign up and running. We decided that what was needed was a campaign to put accessible materials on the internet. Our aim was not to raise money or to improve provision, but simply to improve the recognition of children's language impairments. We received the support of charities (Afasic, The Waterloo Foundation) and for launching the campaign the ESRC grant ES/100064X/1

In May 2012 we launched a YouTube channel (www.youtube.com/rallicampaign) in order to reach three target audiences: families of children who may have SLI, professionals working with children - particularly in education - and young people with SLI themselves. We have as of July 2016 have nearly 2,000 subscribers ? and nearly 400,000 views of our videoclips. The videoclips use research findings from this grant (as well as other research findings). They take the research evidence and transform it into accessible messages clearly presented via short videoclip materials available from the youtube channel.

We believe that with the RALLI youtube channel, we have made a small contribution to enhancing quality of life in line with the ESRC's aim to Enhance quality of life, health and creative output.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EF97033E-4B90-4B46-B404-9179E3FD0F69</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>NOTE CHANGE OF TITLE OF AWARD
The term &amp;quot;maladjustment&amp;quot; was changed to &amp;quot;adjustment&amp;quot; with the approval of the ESRC so that the award revised title reads as follows:
SLI and adulthood: Identifying pathways to resilience/adjustment in personal, social and societal functioning.
This action followed feedback from participants in our advisory group (young adults with SLI, 24 years of age on average). 
 
KEY FINDINGS
Specific language impairment (SLI) affects one in fifteen children in the UK. Little is known however about how these children will &amp;quot;turn out&amp;quot; in adulthood. In this project we followed the Manchester Language Study participants in adulthood (24 years of age) and examined a range of areas of functioning. Below we highlight four of the key findings of this study.
1. Identification of distinct developmental pathways of adjustment in social, emotional, behavioural and employment/education outcomes in adulthood. We found, for example, that 40% of individuals had experienced persistent problems with getting along with others (peer relations) from childhood, with a smaller percentage experiencing increasing problems as they reached adolescence and young adulthood (26%). A third had few/no difficulties with peer relations from childhood to young adulthood or had some difficulties in early childhood which improved in early adolescence. These different pathways were predictable. Risk of peer relation problems was greater for those individuals with language difficulties in the pragmatic domain. The odds of persistent difficulties from childhood to young adulthood were 2.5 times higher for those with poor pragmatic language abilities. 
2. Discovery of prosociality as the key protective factor associated with most areas of functioning in individuals with SLI in young adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate developmental pathways of prosociality in SLI from childhood to young adulthood. We found that individuals with SLI are prosocial in childhood and importantly the development of prosociality of these individuals is stable all the way into young adulthood. We did not find distinct developmental pathways, that is, we did not find that some individuals were antisocial and others prosocial at different stages of development. The only individual differences we found were in &amp;quot;dosage&amp;quot;: approximately one third of individuals were average prosocial whilst the majority (71%) followed a high prosociality trajectory from childhood to young adulthood. This is important positive information about SLI and crucial in our understanding of pathways to resilience.
3. Wellbeing is compromised in identifiable subgroups of young adults with SLI. Our work is the first to determine that health (good vs poor), employment (in employment vs unemployed), and relationships (in a relationship vs not in a relationship) affect the wellbeing of young adults with SLI more than it does their peers. They are more vulnerable than peers in young adulthood to issues they face on their journey towards independence and productive engagement with society. Young adults with SLI seek support services for emotional difficulties in relation to wellbeing.
4. Key partnerships forged. Founder member of the RALLI campaign and the CATALISE Consortium to move forward public and professional understanding of SLI.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have developed an Internet-based platform for our research evidence to be accessible to non-academic audiences: parents, affected children and adults, education and healthcare professionals involved in supporting such individuals (teachers, speech and language therapists). As part of this award, the PI Gina Conti-Ramsden co-founded the RALLI campaign in 2011 (with DBishop, MSnowling, CNorbury and BClark). We launched a YouTube channel where we post short videos about SLI from various perspectives. These range from children and parents talking about how SLI has affected their lives through to brief summaries of recent research evidence. In 2015, the channel is thriving with over 300,000 views and dozens of videoclips organised into thematic playlists, for example, impacts of SLI, supporting SLI. We have an international audience and have What is SLI? videoclips in numerous languages including Welsh, Greek and Chinese. The clips have been by non-academic users (by charities, schools) and by academics in the training of professionals.

Our work has also contributed directly to raising questions about the nature of SLI: characteristics, development and terminology, which are being tackled via the creation of the CATALISE CONSORTIUM in 2015. The PI Gina Conti-Ramsden is a member of the CATALISE expert panel.
