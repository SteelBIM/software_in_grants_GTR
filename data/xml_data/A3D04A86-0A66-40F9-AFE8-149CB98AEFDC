Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K009699/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>One way of simultaneously addressing the work-life balance needs of employees and the productivity needs of employers is the use of flexible working arrangements. Although the general assumption is that flexibility provides workers with a better work-life balance, some scholars argue that it can lead to spill-overs from work to home, prolonging the working day leading to negative results.&lt;br />&lt;br />Despite the mixed results, in-depth evidence based on cross-national data remain lacking and the question of who is really able to benefit from the use of flexibility, in what context, has yet to be answered. To provide this much-needed insight this project examines the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Does working-time flexibility provide a better work-life balance?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Does this impact differ across different individuals, family, company and national contexts and why?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The study applies a multi-level approach connecting the different levels this dynamic takes place: namely the individual-, family, company- and country-levels. In addition, different time points are compared to see the extent of diffusion of working-time flexibility in the past years and how this influences its impact on work-family conflict.The study will match different secondary data sets across 27 European countries between 2002 and 2012 for the analyses.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of the analysis will provide the much needed understanding of the preconditions and contexts where individuals are actually able to take up flexible working-time arrangements as well as when it provides good outcomes at the individual, company as well as country level. Through this, this project aims to help enhance the quality of life and well-being of individuals across Europe, contribute to evidence based policy making both at the national and company level, and enhance efficiency and performance outcomes at the company level as well as government levels. This will benefit the following bodies.
* Workers in need of work-life balance, trade-unions and other worker support organisations
-National level:Trade Union Congress, University and College Union
-European/International level:European Trade Union Confederation, European Trade Union Institute
-Non-government organisations working with work-life balance issues and women's rights:Working Families, Fawcett Society
- Workers?dividuals who are interested in the issues of flexible working 
This project will provide workers and worker support organisation with empirical evidence of the business case for the use of flexible working arrangements, and information concerning how flexible working arrangements should be implemented to best benefit workers. This study will also provide helpful information that can enhance the public awareness and understanding of flexible working and to support the use and extension of flexible working rights for all workers and families. 
*Companies and employers' organisation
-National level:Confederation of British Industries, Federation of Small Businesses
-European level:Business Europe, other European employer's organisations
-Companies who are interested in the issues surrounding flexible working
The results of the project will provide information on the company context where flexible working arrangements can provide optimum performance outcomes for workers as well as companies. Thus this study will help businesses in general, and provide useful insights that can be used by employers and business organisations to help their members use good cost-cutting HR management practices that can lead to productivity gains and profit generation.
* Policy makers and Whitehall departments
-National level:Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, Department for Work and Pensions
-European level:European Foundation, International Labour Organisation, European Commission DG-Employment
The results from the national-level analyses will show us which countries have been successful in providing flexible working-time arrangements to a wider group of workers. In addition, the results will indicate the national preconditions needed to enhance the use of flexible working arrangements and enable its use to the benefit of both workers and companies. This will help enhance the effectiveness of policies aimed to help workers balance work and family life. Without this knowledge, policies introducing flexible working-time may not be successful in achieving their goal and may even lead to unintended negative outcomes. 
I will set up an advisory board consisting of individuals from the three major beneficiary groups as well as academics in the field of comparative working time issues to help guide the process of the project from beginning to end. The results of the study will be disseminated to the users that can benefit from the results of the study through a jargon free executive summary. This will be delivered through a one-day conference held at the University of Kent open to all interested parties. In addition, a website dedicated to this project and interactions with the media will help deliver the key findings of this project to the general public. This will also allow for an easier communication flow to the general public to help public awareness and understanding of working-time flexibility and its impact on work-life balance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243486</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bremen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sociology Department</gtr:department><gtr:description>Academic Advisory Board [*]</gtr:description><gtr:id>622FEFD6-936C-4655-9E25-503A27E5FFA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>[To be updated]</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Academic Advisory Board comprises some of the most outstanding researchers on topics including labour markets, flexible working and employment policy.

Increased flexibility at work allows workers to dedicate time to do many things that were not possible before and this has the potential to provide workers with a better work-life balance.

This has stimulated a heated discussion on the lack of government responses to such issues and how we can address these issues locally- University of Kent, Region of Kent, but also nationally.

The talk has increased public awareness on the issues that women face as barriers in engaging in the labour market.

The paper examines whether flexible work arrangements can help relieve work-family conflict of individuals, and whether this relationship will depend on the national, gender, family and work contexts. It uses the European Social Survey of 2010 and the Work Employment Relations Survey (UK) of 2011. A multilevel random slopes modelling technique will be used to examine whether flexible schedules have a varying impact on individual's perceived work-family conflict across different contexts. Analysis results show that indeed context do matter when examining the relationship between flexible work and work-family conflict.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/lunchtime-seminars/dept-of-sociology-seminar-week-3.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research mentioned in the Daily Mail (newspaper) &quot;Mums who PAY to go to work&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>39D3511F-1E96-4980-B8AB-3CD28359FC67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview with the Daily Mail on work-life balance, childcare and the lack of childcare for working mothers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Flexitime works better for men than women, study mentioned on Zeenews.com (Web) finds</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36935EB8-D1A7-42B6-A184-94607B55E9A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A new study led by the University of Kent finds that although schedule control is associated with increases in overtime and income, it is men that benefit more.

Who has access to schedule control/flexitime?
- It is the highly educated, high skilled workers in upper occupational groups that have most access
- Those who are likely to have more demand for the arrangement - e.g., women, workers with care responsibility do not necessarily have access
- Female dominated job posts and sectors are those with the worst access to schedule control 
- Companies with high-skilled workers, and those using other types of high performance strategies are the ones providing schedule control to its workers
- Countries with generous family policies seem to be those where workers have more access ? family-friendly policies at the national level promotes better corporate culture of family-friendliness
- This is especially for highly the educated ? it seems like schedule control is used as a top up policy

Flexible working and flexibility stigma
- More than 1/3 of workers in the UK hold flexibility stigma based on the BIS Work-Life Balance Survey of 2011
- Men and fathers are more likely have flexibility stigma 
- Workers in smaller establishments, and male dominated workplaces are more likely to feel flexibility stigma
- Flexibility stigma reduces the perceived availability of flexible working arrangements as well as its take up when available
- However, parents of young children still take up flexible working arrangements despite the stigma surrounding it 

Flexible working and work intensity
- There is evidence that schedule control/working time autonomy may increase overtime hours of workers
- This effect is stronger for men, but also similar for full-time working women
- Working remotely also increases (unpaid) overtime hours of workers, especially for men
- However, for men this increase in work intensity seems to pay off - yet not for women (this may be due to employer's perception of how women's flexible working is being used)

Does flexible working enhance work capacity?
- Allowing women to work flexibly does increase the chances of them staying in employment after the birth of their first child
- Allowing women to work flexibly decreases the chances of women reducing their working hours substantially after childbirth

Does flexible working increase work-life balance?
- Flexitime - flexible scheduling - helps reduce work-family conflict(the conflict felt between work and family life) for most workers
- Teleworking on the other hand seem to increase work-family conflict
- Especially those with demanding jobs are those where teleworking can lead to a stronger conflict
- Yet for parents teleworking does not lead to a stronger conflict between work and family

Do contexts make a difference?
- Flexitime can be more beneficial if people are working in work places where long-working hours culture is prevalent
- Flexitime/Schedule control is more detrimental in terms of work-spill over (into family lives) in countries where unemployment rates are higher</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Policy recommendations (to be completed)
- Flexible working can tackle some of the gender inequalities in the labour market by allowing women to maintain their work position post childbirth ? This has huge implications for maintaining women's human capital and to achieve the goal of full employment for the future
- (YET) Flexible working still not being provided to many workers, who need them most and there are groups of workers who may be most disadvantaged ? more campaigns or stronger legislative rights need to be in place for workers but also supportive measures for small/medium sized businesses to implement flexible working in their companies
- Flexibility stigma is still prevalent and need to be addressed through campaigns but also through the introduction of flexibility as a right (not as a gift) ? pushing the discussion of flexible working in all jobs
- More studies are needed to look at the longer-term consequences of working flexibly (not part-time but other flexible work arrangements) - also linked to the traditionalisation of gender roles
- Some types of flexible working can lead to increased work intensity for workers, we need to think of reshaping labour laws to enable the protection of workers outside of the work premises and working hours</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD560BE0-7FD1-4E0A-9D78-A8A77D0AA1A9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.wafproject.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Research outcome cited in the German Labour and Social Affair Ministry's White Paper on the Future of Work</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C7AD938-9072-4145-985C-1932CF4C03E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This whitepaper on future of work is a main documentation outlining the German Ministry of Labour and Social Affair's stance on the developments needed to adapt to the changes in the labour market and the new digitalised economy.
