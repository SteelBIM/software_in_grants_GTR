This project will explore the chemistry of such radicals with the particular objective of identifying and optimising free radical addition reactions which will be beneficial in organic synthesis. Organic synthesis driven by heterogeneous photocatalysis is environmentally and economically attractive, and has the potential to achieve higher selectivity to desired products than conventional routes. We propose to explore a wide range of free radical addition reactions initiated by the known photo-Kolbe reaction of carboxylic acids over titania surfaces. Reactions showing the most promise will be examined in more detail, using in particular in-situ EPR spectroscopy (to observe the initially generated free radicals), in-situ NMR spectroscopy (to identify intermediates and products), and time resolved optical spectroscopy (to observe short lived species) to determine the reaction pathways. Initial studies will be made with TiO2, but we will also explore improvements in performance by adding metals to enhance hole:electron separation, or nitrogen dopants to achieve visible light activation. Visible light activation will also be attempted with other semiconductors. A crucial component of the project is the design and construction of reactors for scaling up promising reactions to a scale attractive to the pharmaceutical industry. The project team has wide experience in photocatalysis, free radical chemistry, in-situ spectroscopic methods and photocatalytic reactor design and construction. Advice and assistance in selection of target reactions relevant to the pharmaceutical industry is provided by GlaxoSmithKline. A successful outcome of the project could bring about a paradigm shift in technologies for high value organic synthesis.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The academic benficiaries of this research will be two groups: those working in photocatalysis, who will learn much more about reaction mechanisms in photocatalytic reactions involving organic molecules, and synthetic organic chemists, who will be presented with a whole new approach to radical carbon-carbon bond forming reactions. The major commercial beneficiaries will be the pharmaceutical industry (as exemplified by the participation of GlaxoSmithKline in this project). The approach proposed here addresses the industry need to move towards more sustainable processing, through reagent-less catalytic chemistry driven at low temperature by light. A successful outcome of this project will give the pharmaceutical industry in the UK a major competitive edge in developing environmentally and economically sustainable routes to high value products. Within the 3.5years of this project we aim to develop selected synthetic reactions to bench scale with reactors which can be scaled to pilot plant in the future. The multidisciplinary approach employed here couples synthetic organic chemistry with materials chemistry, physical chemistry for investigation of reaction pathways, and chemical engineering for reactor design. This approach will benefit immediately the students and PDRA engaged on the project, and have spin-off effects for other research students in the respective research groups. The skills accquired by the students (particularly in appreciating the different components of such a project) will serve them in good stead for employment in the pharmaceutical or other fine chemical industries. Communication of outcomes from this project to the relevant communities will be through (a) the EPSRC funded Photocatalysis Network, UK-SPC, which is a forum for information exchange between academic and industrial parties working in photocatalysis, (b) the industrial supporter of the project (GSK) , (c) presentations at conferences focussed on organic synthesis, (d) publication in widely read journals, (e) a web site dedicated to communication of project outcomes and (f) the European Network on Semiconductor Photocatalysis, which will publicise activities within the wider European context. All research conducted by the consortium with industrial significance will be protected by patenting before public dissemination, and licensing arrangements negotiated with appropriate industries. Two of the investigators (Mills and Robertson) have experience of establishing spin-out companies and negotiating licensing arrangements from scientific discoveries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145772</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/95C64321-8A43-47CB-ABFE-0E68795FF89C"><gtr:id>95C64321-8A43-47CB-ABFE-0E68795FF89C</gtr:id><gtr:title>In situ EPR studies of reaction pathways in Titania photocatalyst-promoted alkylation of alkenes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4938401bce05f50da5b24d2bbdb58fd1"><gtr:id>4938401bce05f50da5b24d2bbdb58fd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rhydderch S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1420-3049</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F35D1349-ED23-4E0A-A2E2-598F6A137EAC"><gtr:id>F35D1349-ED23-4E0A-A2E2-598F6A137EAC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unconventional titania photocatalysis: direct deployment of carboxylic acids in alkylations and annulations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of the American Chemical Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/aa42e6e50c34fb49c49d113d6b69f49c"><gtr:id>aa42e6e50c34fb49c49d113d6b69f49c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Manley DW</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0002-7863</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/I00372X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>FB535BD0-E265-4C0A-8532-32DCB83A3951</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tools, technologies &amp; methods</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>35E9CECD-F211-4914-9F91-4B8FB76B773D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; Applied Catalysis</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
