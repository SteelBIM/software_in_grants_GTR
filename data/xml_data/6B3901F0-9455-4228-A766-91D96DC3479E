capabilities</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/K00168X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Space weather is a serious risk for the UK. The new National Risk Register, published in January 2012, provides formal recognition of this and notes more work is needed to understand and plan for the impacts of severe events. This message was echoed in the February 2012 report of the House of Commons Defence Committee on Developing Threats: Electro-Magnetic Pulses. This noted the need for more research to understand and mitigate the space weather impacts, especially on the National Grid.

The UK has a wide range of world-class expertise to understand and deal with the problems caused by space weather. However, this is spread over the universities, research institutes, industry and government labs. There are many informal links between people at working level in these groups, but no structure that can coordinate their efforts to maximise the benefit to the UK and to mutual benefit of the groups involved. This proposal seeks to do that. We will hold a series of events that bring together experts from the research and applications communities - first to discuss how to coordinate UK efforts in particular areas and then to build up a virtual UK Space Weather Centre. The particular areas of space weather interest will include impacts on power grids, aviation, satellite navigation, communications and the tracking and operation of spacecraft.

A key aim will be better links between the UK space weather research and applications communities, so that researchers are ever more aware of the many potential routes through which their research can have impact on real-world issues - and the applications community appreciates the scientific capabilities that exist in the UK and the links that the scientific community has with other experts around the world. Such links will help the UK to develop a strong research programme that helps to mitigate the problems caused by space weather and that enables researchers to seek funding for their work. The results of that programme will also enable the UK to work with international partners, especially the US and in Europe, to develop international measures that recognise and deal with the global threat from space weather. The UK can then contribute to international efforts at a level appropriate to its technical and financial capabilities whilst deriving benefit from the whole of those efforts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The over-arching aim of this project is to develop better links between research on space weather and the needs of industry and governmental groups that have to handle the adverse impacts of space weather - and thereby stimulate and promote research that will improve the ability of those groups to handle those impacts. Thus the beneficiaries include:

1. Commercial organisations that operate technological systems at risk from space weather. There is growing awareness that many business operations may be affected by space weather. Thus companies will benefit from stimulation of research that quantifies these effects and identifies where space weather knowledge can significantly improve business processes. Key beneficiaries for such impact are high-volume businesses where small improvements can have high financial return (e.g. power grids) and businesses with high-value products that need to be protected from adverse impacts (e.g. magnetic surveys). 

2. Some of these commercial organisations operate critical national infrastructures such as the National Grid, the civil aviation system and satellite communication services. These need to be protected from severe space weather, as recognised in the 2012 National Risk Register. Thus the benefits of this project will be space weather support for (a) wider national activities that address the resilience of those infrastructures - and (b) UK participation in EU and international efforts to improve resilience of critical infrastructures. It will benefit government policy makers by stimulating the generation of new peer-reviewed scientific evidence that can guide policy decisions, e.g. better specification of extreme space weather conditions.

3. Many public sector activities are affected by space weather, e.g. communication, navigation and surveillance systems used by the military and security services. Both operators and policy-makers will benefit from this project through a better awareness of the limitations that space weather imposes on those systems and by encouraging research that can help users mitigate and manage those limitations.

4. The wider public will benefit from the more balanced reporting of space weather that we seek to promote. We already have examples of people being scared by current media hype - and reassured by good public engagement from space weather experts. We will continue that work and promote best practice in the reporting of space weather.

The benefits from this project will include both short-, medium- and long-term elements. In the short-term the major benefit will be increased awareness of space weather amongst beneficiaries and, perhaps, the adoption of better procedures for handling space weather problems, e.g. the proposed workshop will enable beneficiaries to know which scientists can provide timely advice when they encounter problems or wish to plan for future risks. The medium-term element will be the stimulation of research projects. The proposed workshops will enable researchers and beneficiaries to identify where new science can improve the understanding and mitigation of space weather problems. Thus an outcome of this project will be the submission of research proposals to study that new science, with some support (e.g. data and advice) from beneficiaries. We hope to see a good number of these proposals, with some funded and underway by the end of this project. The long-term benefit will the establishment of a UK space weather centre that will be a focus through which researchers and beneficiaries can come together to explore future space weather problems, e.g. arising through deployment of new technologies and services.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>33935</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Space Science Department</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>RAL Space</gtr:department><gtr:description>Space-based studies of geomagnetic disturbances and their space weather impacts</gtr:description><gtr:id>5D65F83B-5118-4B5E-A986-2D00F73EAAD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>No detailed information on the split of contributions, but there is a natural split between RAL, Lancaster, Imperial, UCL and BAS focusing on the magnetospheric and atmospheric aspects of the study, whilst Leeds, Edinburgh and Liverpool focus on how the solid earth modifies the response to geomagnetic disturbances, whilst BGS has expertise in both areas.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The development of this partnership was strongly stimulated by the SEREN workshop on power grid impacts.

This meeting sought to explore how the UK scientific community can best respond to that motivation, by raising community awareness (a) of the multiple pathways by which solar activity leads to adverse technological impacts, and (b) of the complexity inherent in these pathways, especially the driving of geomagnetic and ionospheric storms by coronal mass ejections. This was done through a mix of talks on the science and impacts of space weather by relevant experts from universities, research institutes, industry and government. The consequent exchange of ideas was welcomed by many, if not all, attendees. 

One important conclusion from the meeting was the need to develop a common vocabulary to support dialogue about space weather across these diverse communities. Thus it is proposed to develop a space weather dictionary as part of the follow-up from this meeting.

This is an FP7 project (https://www.qb50.eu/) that will launch a large number of cubesats (small satellites around 1 kg mass) to measure conditions in the upper atmosphere, which is strongly influenced by space weather. This mission is a great opportunity to improve our understanding of the impact of space weather on the terrestrial environment - for the first time making simultaneous in-situ satellite measurements at such a large number of points. The SEREN involvement enabled many UK scientists to engage with the QB50 team (from UK and Belgium) to discuss optimising the scientific return, which will be valuable for understanding space weather.

The key outcome was a better sense of what is needed to improve space weather forecasting, as well as identifying gaps in our understanding.

The key findings were:
UK instruments contribute significantly to international networks on which emerging space weather services are being founded. Typically providing up to 15% of the global assets.
The instruments are supported based solely on their research value and there is currently no economic model to co-fund the instruments for their added value to space weather operations. Most of the instruments had no identified support beyond 2 years.
The instruments are capable of meeting space weather observing standards set out by the World Meteorological Organisation but additional investment is required to achieve this (e.g., adaption for dual research-and-operations purpose and near-real-time data transfer).
In summary, space weather service development is vulnerable to a reliance on ground-based instruments designed and supported for scientific research purposes rather than commercial need or public good. Some progress has been made on addressing this, as outlined below.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An outcome has been the development of the Space Weather Operational Observing Network (SWOON) concept whose aim is to upgrade existing UK ground-based instruments in the Scandinavian, British and Atlantic sectors to standards necessary for supporting 24/7 space weather services.
