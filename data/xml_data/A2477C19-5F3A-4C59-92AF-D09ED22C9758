Within this context, this project focuses particularly on housing policy and its relationship to residential mobility among poor families. Although moving home is a common experience for families with pre-school children, this is a topic which has received relatively little attention. The international comparison offered by this study not only permits families to be followed over time but to compare their experiences in two policy regimes, one where residential stability for young families is relatively protected, as it was in the UK in the early 2000s, with the more open, more privately rented, housing provisions in the USA. We have designed this project and its dissemination strategy specifically to inform the likely consequences for children in UK of proposed changes to social housing which are expected to result in less stable housing tenure. We will discuss the UK housing policy issues with potential users in the public and third sectors at early stages of the research design. Knowledge about which families move, where and why will also be of practical use for the provision of a number of services, many provided by local authorities. We cannot conclude whether the research will reach the conclusion that it is important for young families to avoid moves, and/or for locally based services to have better provisions for catering to movers, but we expect there to be a useful message, one way or the other. 
 
In order to communicate our evidence and findings to a range of audiences, we have plans to use the websites, working papers and other dissemination infrastructure of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS at IoE), the Centre for Social Exclusion at LSE (CASE) and the Graduate Center of CUNY. We are planning to hold a workshop on the housing policy issues for an audience including policy makers and practitioners from central, devolved and local government and third sector in London in early 2014. This will take place under the auspices of the CASE, which has a good network to reach such an audience. In addition, we are planning two events, in New York and at CLS in London, to report findings and introduce researchers to the possibilities for comparative research on the two datasets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>353612</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>City University of New York (CUNY)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Home Moves in US and UK: outcomes in early childhood</gtr:description><gtr:id>015BD136-191E-4880-AE20-40ACD7FB1DD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A special issue collecting outputs together is in production the journal Longitudinal and Lifecourse Studies, 2016

The event was recorded and is available as a podcast. Our supporting briefing paper has been distributed through the CLS website. The lessons drawn from our findings by speakers from the National Housing Federation and the Child Poverty Action Group were that home moving is not necessarily a problem when it involves families with young children, but that when problems occur, they are likely to involve several domains, and indicate the need for housing policy to be 'joined up' with other policies targeting poor families. 

The policy implications of our findings about the early years of the Millennium for the different circumstances of its second decade have been brought out in Ruth Lupton's contribution to the collection of articles published in July 2016. There were efforts to attract press interest in the results at this point, in particular through the following blog

By this age socially patterned differences in child development have emerged. Our project pointed out that the early years are also a period when many families move home, a topic which had received less attention. We asked whether moving made its own difference to the development at age 5 in two cohorts of British and American children in the first half of the 2000s.
1. We documented the extent of residential mobility among young families in the UK Millennium Cohort Study and the US Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study. Our survey data reflected census evidence that moving home was particularly frequent in the US, but also more common among British families with pre-school than older children. In both countries, mobility was relatively higher in insecure housing tenures (such as private rental), and for parents with unstable partnerships or unstable employment. In UK, the well-educated were also relatively likely to move.
2. We measured children's progress to age 5 in terms of behavioural adjustment and vocabulary. Although in both countries children who had moved tended to have poorer scores than those who did not, we established that children's development at age 5 does not in general show a deficit associated with moving per se, after allowing for the circumstance of the move and of the family's resources and capabilities.
3. We therefore sought to distinguish between 'good moves' and 'bad moves', by developing, for both countries, an Index of Local Social Disadvantage to allow for the quality of the neighbourhood. In UK we also had information on the family's own rating and on housing conditions. Most moves were 'good', resulting in families improving their situation by moving in the normal course of family life. A minority of families made 'bad moves' to worse homes or areas, under adverse circumstances, which to some extent amplified poorer outcomes for children.
4. We conclude that mobility played a relatively small part in the very evident emergence of social and economic gaps in the development of these children to age 5. We showed that there is some disadvantage attached to living in poor areas, whether or not the family moved, and regardless of the family's own income, in UK in this era.
5. We have shown that residential mobility not only affects substantial proportions of young families, but in a selective way. Therefore longitudinal studies of young children should try to avoid the bias that would be involved in studying only families who do not move, and the management of such data should invest resources in tracing and following up families who move.
We point out that the circumstances of the housing situation in the UK a decade later have become more likely to lead to the sort of 'bad moves' which add to family and child stress. We urge the policy makers in the fields of housing and family services to protect families from 'bad moves', or their consequences, and also to consider how to facilitate the 'good moves' which enable families to improve their life chances.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We hope the research community may find our Index of Local Social Disadvantage of use for other purposes, particularly other comparative work with the USA.
A far as the development of research is concerned, the scientific question of the consequences of mobility for children should be taken forward to outcomes and moves at older ages, in both cohorts. Given the results on MCS Older Siblings' behaviour scores, priority should go cognitive and academic outcomes. School as well as home moves should be considered. In the MCS this would involve using administrative data for England, which could, at some cost, be extended to the Older Siblings as well as the cohort members. These data are not currently linked although consent was obtained.

Another suggestion is that the evidence for this and other questions could benefit from more complete dating of event histories reported to MCS for family and employment events as well home moves. We would also encourage the collection of data on intentions to move, constraints on moving and alternative adaptations that are made when moving is difficult.

Another area to be addressed, not involving cohort data, would be a study, or discussion, of how health, housing, social work and early education services communicate with each other and across locations when families moves. The housing and social work sectors are assumed to be covered by Communities and Social Services as arenas for impact below.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2C397510-6524-40CD-B7E4-F1F561E7C464</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=1228&amp;sitesectiontitle=Home+moves+in+early+years%3a+The+impact+on+children+in+UK+and+US</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Index of Local Area Disadvantage (ILAD) was created as an ecological measure to be merged to the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) data and to a US data set, Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing. We constructed an index for each country, with the explicit intent of making them as similar as possible for our comparative research on Residential Mobility in the United Kingdom and United States. For the UK ILAD ranks geographic areas across according to their socio-(economic) characteristics and is an adaptation of the Index of Neighborhood Disadvantage from Wodtke et al., 2011 for the US.
For the UK the index has been constructed for the following geographies:
For England and Wales, the selected units were the Lower-level Super Output Area (LSOA); for Scotland the comparable Data-Zone (DZ); for Northern Ireland the Electoral or Council Ward. 
Six measures were selected to create ILARD for the UK. They refer to census indicators of socio-economic conditions, with the exception of our proxy for poverty which is taken from administrative records on means tested benefits. 
1) Proportion of households receiving means-tested benefits;
2) Proportion of people of age 16+ who are in the civilian labor force and unemployed;
3) Proportion of female lone parent households with dependent children; 
4) Proportion of people with no educational qualifications;
5) Proportion of people with high educational qualifications; 
6) Proportion of managerial and professional workers. 
Data are from the 2001 Population Census, and 2001 administrative records. 
ILARD was created by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the six selected measures of disadvantage. 
OUr analysis supports the inference that ILARD is cross-nationally valid. The indexes created for both UK and US exhibit: almost equal patterns in the component loadings of the original measures; very similar high percentages of total variation (of the original variables) reproduced; and substantially the same distribution.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7E230F1A-749C-43F0-9F6D-39FFAB37A9F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The index is being made available this month, so we are not in a position yet to report any impact.
