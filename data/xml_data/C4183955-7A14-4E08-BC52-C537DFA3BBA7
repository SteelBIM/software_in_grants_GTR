The potential for smaller-scale local manufacturing (RDM) and its contribution to UK GDP was made clear at the EPSRC Re-Distributed Manufacturing Workshop in November 2013. As the Workshop report concluded, successful implementation in UK industry presents many challenges and opportunities. The creation of a series of Networks to explore and define these issues, and the research agenda required to resolve them, is a timely approach to harnessing the expertise of a multidisciplinary community into a future coherent research initiative.

Our focus on manufacture of healthcare devices and therapies reflects the socio-economic importance of healthcare within the UK. The NHS has a turnover of some &amp;pound;121bn in the UK and serves a population of around 64m citizens - marginal advances in technology and services can have large impacts. Healthcare technologies are an EPSRC Challenge theme. The proposed RDM in Healthcare Network's (RiHN) objectives will support all four of the strategic priorities identified by EPSRC (novel treatment and therapeutic technologies; enhanced prediction and diagnosis in real time at the point-of-care; technologies for a healthy life course; and design, manufacture and integration of healthcare technologies). 

RDM may change the delivery of healthcare products, enhancing national competitiveness and citizen well-being through: a) Cost reduction through terminal customisation or delayed manufacture based upon flexible intermediate products; b) Just-in-time delivery, particularly of perishable healthcare goods, c) Reduction of operational overheads by sharing support services between local manufacturing hubs, d) Management of capacity by distributing production through scale-out, rather than scale-up, e) Avoidance of placing high up-front capital cost at riskby building small production units in response to increase in demand instead of single large factories.

There are key challenges to realising these benefits: Technical needs must meet the appropriate regulatory standard; new training patterns must be established to maintain operating quality from a distance; social and inter-personal features must be addressed to enhance quality of life, incorporating quality assurance into the business structures; new customer-supplier relationships must be forged. 

RiHN aims to explore these challenges and incentives and will be led by a multi-disciplinary team drawn from manufacturing, management, human factors and healthcare technologies, combining the expertise required from both the social sciences and engineering. The consortium has experience in delivery of major national networks and research centres and will build on the established relationships that the team have with industry, clinical networks, the NHS, regulatory bodies, policy-makers, academics and end users.

RiHN aims to develop the research agenda for RDM in healthcare, engaging with relevant academic and user communities through workshops and user engagement events, and through conducting feasibility studies in five distinct areas: 1. Medical Devices; 2. Pharmaceuticals; 3. Advanced Therapeutics (cell and tissue); 4. Dentistry; 5. Diagnostics. In doing so, RiHN intends to establish a community of practice for RDM in Healthcare, outlining the future direction for research, which will be published in a white paper. The outputs of RiHN will also be disseminated through a website, presentations at relevant national and international conferences, participation at other RDM Network events and research centres and a Special Issue journal (Journal of Operations Management) presenting the findings of the feasibility studies. A final report will be produced, sent electronically to all interested parties, and made available on RiHN's website.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Network will work directly with beneficiaries to ensure that feasibility studies funded by the network are of relevance to a range of stakeholders, and have the potential for implementation in a healthcare context. User engagement events and workshops with interested and relevant parties will ensure that stakeholders have the opportunity express their views and shape the research agenda. Cross-sectoral learning will be supported through collaboration with the other RDM Networks.
 
A range of commercial private sector beneficiaries will include small and medium sized enterprises who participate in network meetings, develop or sell technologies and products (such as 3D scanners, mobile app developers, specialist manufacturers of customised parts, pharmacists) that will be used to realise RDM activities. In addition to these smaller businesses, large organisations (such as Smith &amp;amp; Nephew, Surgical Innovations Group Plc) will engage with the network as participants in projects, providing expertise and scoping of feasibility topics. The benefit of participation and engagement with this project for the commercial sector will include increased knowledge and understanding of the potential for new technologies and networks of technologies in the healthcare sector, understanding of personal and societal attitudes towards RDM in healthcare applications, and links with potential commercial partners in future RDM healthcare activities. 
 
The healthcare sector, in particular the NHS, will benefit from this project, through the increased awareness of the appropriate mechanism through which new models of distributed manufacturing can be implemented within a range of different healthcare products, from pharmaceuticals, to cell based therapeutics and personal medical devices. This awareness will inform cost effectiveness analysis of new healthcare approaches, and ensure that the regulatory and legal considerations of altering models of healthcare manufacturing are appreciated throughout the supply and user chain. In the future, based upon insights from this Network, medical personnel including doctors, pharmacists, nursing staff and carers, will also benefit, due to higher quality products being delivered, leading to easier introduction of healthcare products and devices to patients, increased personalisation of devices (resulting in fewer side effects due to customised devices with improved 'fit'. 
 
The general public will benefit through more personalised models of healthcare manufacture and delivery, improved health outcome resulting from higher levels of customisation and speed of production, and increased satisfaction with their healthcare provision due to the reduced need to travel to specialist providers, coupled with the retention of communication with and support from relevant healthcare experts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>467416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Outline of research programme purpose and explanation of the potential value of redistributed manufacturing in healthcare.

The five feasibility studies have been an important part of the definition process. The network brought together partners from different academic, industrial and health sector communities to ensure that the feasibility studies in redistributed manufacturing (RDM) for healthcare were informed directly by societal and commercial needs. Results from these studies, conducted by researchers drawn from the manufacturing, healthcare and social science academic communities, have had a direct impact on a range of users, including industry stakeholders, healthcare providers and the general public (as 'prosumers' of healthcare).

Impact as a philosophy therefore underpins this networked approach, and this multidisciplinary network continues to bring together a group of investigators who have extensive experience in working with such mechanisms. There are a number of specific activities that have contributed to the impact of RiHN:
? Network meetings that have brought together industry, user, health sector and academic partners 
? A sandpit approach to identification and selection of multidisciplinary feasibility studies 
? Electronic and social media communications to disseminate the outputs and activities of the network 
? Specific focused events targeting key populations of relevance to the network e.g. clinical networks, pharmaceutical industry and healthcare regulators

RiHN has worked directly with beneficiaries to ensure that the feasibility studies funded by the network have been of relevance to a range of stakeholders, and have the potential for implementation in a healthcare context. This was undertaken by means of a rigorous selection process involving a panel of experts representing key beneficiaries drawn from industry, public healthcare organisations and policy and regulatory bodies.

Key beneficiaries include: 

1) The commercial private sector, including small and medium sized enterprises (that sell technologies and products used to realise RDM) and large organisations (such as Smith &amp;amp; Nephew, Peacocks) have engaged with the network, attending network meetings and providing expertise during the scoping of feasibility topics. The benefits for commercial organisations in participating and engaging with RiHN and the feasibility studies includes:
a. increased knowledge and understanding of the potential for new technologies and networks of technologies in the healthcare sector
b. understanding of personal and societal attitudes towards RDM in healthcare application
c. an improved understanding of how RDM techniques can enhance supply chain resilience. Areas of particular benefit include the identification of potential points of failure in the supply chain and how RDM can reduce waste and meet unexpected peaks in demand.
d. Development of links with potential commercial partners in future RDM healthcare activities.
2) The healthcare sector, in particular the NHS, have benefited from this project, through:
a. increased awareness of the appropriate mechanism through which new models of RDM can be implemented within a range of different healthcare products, from pharmaceuticals, to cell based therapeutics and personal medical devices. This awareness can be used to inform cost effectiveness analysis of new healthcare approaches, ensuring that the regulatory and legal considerations of altering models of healthcare manufacturing are appreciated throughout the supply and user chain. 
b. Medical personnel, including doctors, pharmacists, nursing staff and carers have benefited through engagement in the feasibility studies, promoting an enhanced understanding by the user community of how RDM can support the development of higher quality products. This in turn should lead to easier introduction of healthcare products and devices to patients, and increased personalisation of devices (resulting in right-first-time therapies and fewer side effects due to device 'fit' and right-first-time therapies). 
3) Healthcare regulators have benefited from the important contribution that the feasibility study and workshop findings have made in developing an understanding of likely pathways that will emerge through a move towards RDM, contributing towards the development of proportionate regulation.
4) The general public will benefit from the findings as these have fed through to industry, policy-makers and regulators, supporting a move towards more personalised models of healthcare manufacture and delivery. Feasibility study findings suggest patients have no concerns about using RDM-manufactured devices and they should benefit from improved health outcomes resulting from higher levels of customisation and speed of production, and increased satisfaction with their healthcare provision due to the reduced need to travel to specialist providers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AF19DCE0-BF97-48E8-8D04-33579733847E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Electronics,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Redistributed Manufacturing Network has brought together an multi-disciplinary team of academics and practitioners together to map the research landscape for redistributed (RDM) in healthcare. RiHN oversaw the running of several, workshops, sandpits, round table discussions and technology roadmapping events. During the process RiHN identified the following key underlying principles as Re-Distributed Manufacturing? 
? Technology and systems: introduction of manufacturing innovations that disrupt the supply chain and/or therapy treatment process resulting in a leaner operation and/or greater agility
? Location: localised production, bringing it closer to clinical need or point of use
? Governance: compliance with regulation and standards is essential, particularly to manage quality and variance in manufacturing output across distributed sites
? Dependencies: complementary technologies and skills (e.g. imaging, modelling, programming) are required in most cases to strengthen the business case for RDM adoption, as is physical healthcare infrastructure readiness
? Radical reorganisation of the value chain
? Defining the boundary between manufacturing and the practice of medicine - where does one finish and the other begin or are the two processes converging?

RiHN has identified enablers for RDM:
? Advances in personalised medicine, which allow tailored treatments are likely to require complementary advances in RDM
? Quantitative and qualitative data on current manufacturing supply performance help to strengthen the business case for specific applications
? Focus on niche applications such as emergency and military medicine, or rare or hard-to-treat diseases or where there is pressing need for change or costs are high e.g. the treatment of diabetes
? Leveraging the clinical, scientific and engineering skills base that exists with the UK
? Key clinical exemplar demonstrators in order to progress (with economy of scope and new business model)
? Advances in manufacturing technology to support a move to redistributed modes of manufacture
? Job creation / intermediate skills levels for out-scaling to support localised production across numerous sites
In mapping the research landscape, RiHN has identified five key research challenges:
1) Regulation and Management of Quality
a. Regulation: new models of validation and verification for autonomous manufacturing systems 
b. Basis of assurance of quality in Real-Time Release Technology (RTRT) and data mining for adaptive control
2) Manufacturing
a. Development of manufacturing systems that support redistributed models of production
b. Point of use or postponed manufacturing - difficulties of implementing healthcare manufacturing in a localised setting e.g. home use, clinical setting
3) Clear economic models, including subtleties such as understanding the cost/benefit (quality of life issues, overhead costs of manufacturing and healthcare delivery) - enhanced health economics, adaptation of reimbursement systems to recognise new patterns of value addition
4) Design of technology to support reproducible, efficient redistributed manufacture of goods at an acceptable capital cost and that integrates well with hospital and supply-chain practice
5) Inter-operability of systems and related industry guidance with progressive creation of relevant standards
RiHN has also identified five key societal challenges associated with RDM in healthcare

1) Job losses and creation - offshore, onshore and re-shore
2) Management of liability for product quality, safety and efficacy (including software performance)
3) Patient take-up and compliance including public-patient engagement
4) Management of skills and training (including refresher training) in end-stage operations in clinical settings
5) Cyber security (cyber physical systems) and product piracy / health tourism</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>RiHN has identified that the current value of redistributed manufacturing lies in niche applications such as emergency and military medicine and humanitarian aid. Consequently, RiHN research outcomes have the potential to be taken forward in such scenarios. Consequently, RiHN is currently working with Defence Medical Services to explore how RDM could enhance medical responses in deployed operations and emergency scenarios, identifying potential approaches that will support the tailoring of conventional medical systems to bespoke defence challenges. RiHN has already received initial EPSRC workshop funding, but intends to take this further through undertaking a larger scale research project with the defence sector and other frontline services e.g. paramedics

Additional funding for key niche therapies investigated by RiHN, such as cellular therapies could help further the systematic understanding of how healthcare delivery functions within these niches and enable implementation of key innovations towards not only improving patient outcomes, but also saving the NHS money through process redistribution.
Through RiHN funding, one of the feasibility studies now has a viable product, the PeePod, that could follow the RDM model. The research team involved in the PeePod study intend to set up a prototype manufacturing pipeline and assess the practical difficulties in implementing such a model.

Overall, RiHN has identified a need to undertake future studies to assess commercial feasibility of RDM technologies in the near future (&amp;lt;10 years), once the technological capabilities are more clearly established, it is important that hospitals, universities and businesses collaborate to ensure the interests of all parties combine to realise future developments and build a business case for the adoption of RDM in the healthcare sector. 

The social and environmental benefits of the RDM model have been outlined by RiHN and other EPSRC RDM networks, future studies could build on these findings to investigate how firms have transitioned to an RDM system to enhance their environmental and social profile. For the NHS, future research could be undertaken into measuring the sustainability impact of medical products manufactured through conventional routes versus RDM, aiding the decision to make locally e.g. within a hospital, or buy from suppliers.

Finally, RiHN intends to enhance its presence at a policy level through the production of a White Paper that will draw on the findings of RiHN workshops, the feasibility studies and inputs from RDM experts. RiHN will maintain its online presence and will disseminate future findings electronically and through journal articles e.g International Journal of Operations Management (IJOPM), Production, Planning and Control (PPC), and conference papers e.g. European Operations Management Association (EurOMA).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2B777CCA-2529-47F1-A807-6E8E7DAD26F2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rihn.org.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Navigating Regulatory requirements</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1653CBA8-C543-47F6-975D-E8BBB41C6D5E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://rihn.org.uk/event/navigating-regulatory-requirements-for-redistributed-manufacturing-in-healthcare/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a membership database of 232 individuals who have helped us advance the agenda of redistributed manufacturing in healthcare.
