Solar Energy is the world's largest renewable energy resource; the solar irradiation on the plant in one hour exceeds our current annual global energy demand. Existing solar conversion technologies achieve the conversion of solar energy to electricity (photovoltaics) or heat (solar thermal). Both technologies are making rapid scientific and technical progress, and achieving substantial market growth. For example 6.4 x 10^10 W of photovoltaic (PV) systems had been installed in &amp;gt; 100 countries by December 2011. However these solar conversion technologies have two significant limitations - the lack of a viable, scale-able energy storage strategy to address the intermittency of solar irradiation - and the lack of a viable mechanism to convert sunlight into transportation fuel. Given that transportation currently comprises ~ 1/3 of global energy demand, this latter limitation is of particular concern. 

Plant photosynthesis demonstrates the viability of the direct conversion of sunlight to chemical fuels, storing the incident solar irradiation in the form of chemical bonds. However the relatively low solar to biomass energy conversion efficiencies of natural photosynthesis, and the limited availability of suitable cultivatable land, limit the global potential of direct bioenergy conversion. As such, artificial photosynthetic strategies are attracting extensive interest for the development of chemical reactors capable of utilising sunlight to drive the synthesis of molecular fuels. 

The production of fuels (H2, HCO2H, CH3OH, CH4 etc.) using solar energy is now a very rapidly developing research field internationally. It is highly inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary, encompassing a range of scientifically distinct approaches to solar-driven synthesis of molecular fuels. Whilst the potential role(s) of solar-driven fuel synthesis within the overall parallel challenges of solar energy utilisation and renewable fuel synthesis needs to be clarified, there is increasing appreciation of the importance of meeting these challenges, and recent impressive scientific advances in the solar fuels field, are driving this field very rapidly up the scientific, commercial and policy agendas.

Network Focus
The Solar Fuels Network will focus on direct photo-driven fuel synthesis strategies. These include photoelectrochemical, molecular and photocatalytic strategies. Developing these strategies requires bringing together a range of disciplines including photoelectrochemistry, redox catalysis, molecular and semiconductor photochemistry, materials and particularly nanomaterials design and synthesis, photoreactor design and engineering as well as technology, environmental and lifecycle analyses. 

Whilst the Network will focus on direct photo-driven processes, it is important to recognise that advances in this field will most probably be dependent upon advances in wider research fields, including electrocatalysis, biological photosynthetic processes, semiconductor photocatalysis and photovoltaics. Furthermore, assessment of solar fuels technology applications will require interfacing with, and evaluation against, alternative or complementary fuel synthesis strategies including water electrolysis, thermochemical CO2 reduction, CO2 capture, fuel cells, solar cells and alternative energy storage strategies. As such, the Network will plan to work closely with these research communities, including in particular organising joint events with suitable partner programmes and organisations - for example, the CO2 Chemistry and Semiconductor Photocatalysis Networks, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell, Storage, Bioenergy and Solar Supergen Hubs, the EG&amp;amp;S and Nanotechnology KTN's, the Royal Society of Chemistry etc.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to its impact on the academic artificial photosynthesis research community, Tthe network will also address the wider challenge of developing UK science and technology roadmaps on solar to fuels, and how this technology can contribute to reductions in green house gas emissions both within the UK and globally. In this regard, we will work with other EPSRC funded hubs and networks addressing complimentary science and technology issues, as detailed in the case for support, including the CO2 Chemistry and Semiconductor Photocatalysis Networks, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell, Storage, Bioenergy and Solar Supergen Hubs. Members of the network are already closely engaged with international initiatives on solar fuels (including for example EuChemS and the US JCAP and Solar Fuels Institute) enabling us to maximise synergies, and the global impact, of network activities. Both the RSC and Foreign and Commenwealth Office's Science and Innovation network have expressed interest in working with network to enable its global engagement, including the sponsoring of international and bilateral meetings (see supporting letters).

Of particular importance in maximising the impact of this network will be engagement with the Royal Society of Chemistry. The applicants already have a strong record of working with the RSC to raise the profile and coherence of solar fuels research in the UK and in initiating discussion of a UK roadmap in this field. The RSC has expressed a strong commitment to working with the solar fuels network to maximising our joint impact in this area, including:
 - Continued support to UK community-building, including, for example, partial financial support for meetings. 
 - Running RSC organised solar fuels meetings, including international conferences, workshops and bilateral meetings.
 - Publicity and dissemination activities through RSC journals, magazines and websites.
 - Policy focussed events and drafting of policy documents. 

The applicant's activities to date in conjunction with the RSC have already had a very strong track record - with the launch of the RSC's policy document on solar fuels, and the associated meeting, receiving extensive interest in both the scientific and popular press (see letter of support from RSC for details). 

The application PI, Prof Durrant, has a strong track record of working with the RSC on solar fuels, and also sits on the RSC's Environment and Sustainable Energy Committee. Several advisory board members are closely associated with RSC activities in this area already, including Anthony Harriman (RSC's Solar Champion) and Mercedes Maroto-Valer (Chair of RSC's Energy Sector committee). Beyond the RSC, Professor Durrant already has experience in integrating and co-ordinating activities across the energy sector through his role as Deputy Director of Imperial's Energy Futures Lab. The applicants moreover cover all the main subject disciplines relevant to solar fuels research - comprising Chemistry (Durrant), Materials (Riley), Chemical Engineering (Kelsall) and Biochemistry (Barber), thus enabling the network to maximise its engagement in all of these disciplines. 

Outreach and dissemination activities will be a key function of the network. Currently the challenge of renewable fuel synthesis, and solar driven fuel synthesis in particular, is not widely appreciated by the wider scientific community, policy makers and the general public. In this regard, several members of the network already have strong track records in such outreach and dissemination activities including including Professors Parkin and Sella at UCL, Cogdell and Cronin at Glasgow and Rutherford, Riley and Barber at Imperial. Building upon this strength, we will work with our partners organisations (RSC, EG&amp;amp;S and Nano KTN's and FCO's Science and Innovation Network) and facilitate and encourage all network members to engage in outreach and dissemination activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252971</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Vitaflo International</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SFN-FOTOFUEL</gtr:description><gtr:id>D6892D58-5FCE-485C-B425-56ECF2AB4999</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Summer school (May 2016): catalysis, photochemistry/physics, solid state physics, electrochemistry, sustainable fuels, solar energy, hydrogen generation, CO2 utilisation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The SFN does not have the resources to organise its own training (summer/winter) schools.

Comparing 'electrolyser-powered-by-photo-voltaics 'and 'photo-electrochemical' systems for H2 production by splitting H2O with solar energy
Abstract:
Combustion of hydrogen produces only water, making it an attractive energy carrier for the future, providing it can be produced by routes other than by reforming natural gas, the present predominant industrial route, as it emits carbon dioxide. Is it feasible to use solar energy to generate hydrogen in the UK? What technologies can enable this presently? How much hydrogen may be produced and how could it be used? These and other questions relating to the expansion of solar energy use in the UK will be addressed in this webinar.
Hydrogen can be produced from solar energy today by coupling photo-voltaic devices, which convert solar to electrical energy, with electrolysers that use this electrical energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. However, does the use of land for photo-voltaic arrays for hydrogen production by this means justify the rates at which it can be generated realistically?
Photo-electrochemical systems are a potential alternative to the existing technologies, combining photon-to-electron and electron-to-hydrogen conversions in a single device, but are still the subject of research and are not available industrially.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://solarfuelsnetwork.com/event/webinar-hydrogen-production/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imperial Festival</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E9273B6-470E-4660-815B-5B2E29E35E81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A stand with a solar energy/solar fuels theme has been presented by SFN members at the Imperial Festival for three years.

Chaired by Prof James Barber FRS (Imperial College London) and co-chaired by Prof Harry Gray FRS (Caltech), this conference brought together the international artificial photosynthesis community to discuss the challenges of and possible pathways to a working solar fuels device. Presentations from world-leading researchers in this field were each followed by plenty of time for discussion. A poster session allowed early career researchers to present their work. An afternoon panel discussion with open-floor question and answer session on the question What will be the role of solar-derived fuels in meeting CO2 reduction commitments? featured contributions from Dame Mary Archer DBE, Prof Harry Gray FRS, Sir Chris Llewellyn Smith FRS, Lord Robert May FRS, Prof Daniel Nocera, and Sir John Meurig Thomas FRS. The panel discussion session and Prof Nocera's talk were filmed and are available to watch on the Energy Futures Lab channel on Youtube. There were 135 attendees at the International Discussion Meeting, with 38 posters presented, and 80 attendees at the Early Career Researchers' Symposium, 31 of whom presented posters and 11 of whom gave oral presentations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://solarfuelsnetwork.com/news/international-discussion-meeting-solar-fuels-moving-from-materials-to-devices-7th-8th-july-royal-society-london/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talks at The Institute for Education</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E835330-4BB5-464E-8DEF-E5CD74D93156</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Stephanie Pendlebury, Project Manager of the Solar Fuels Network, has given three talks (each to audiences of about 1000 A-level chemistry students and their teachers) at the Institute for Education (UCL). The talk title was &amp;quot;Materials Chemistry to Save the World&amp;quot;, and covered materials chemistry in renewable energy applications, with a particular emphasis on solar fuels. The audience was encourage to ask questions throughout the talk. The talk raised the profile of this research area with chemistry students and their teachers, and encouraged students to consider how chemistry has an impact on the technology in their everyday lives.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SOFI-SFN Collaboration Initiating Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB8574D2-5538-419B-9F7E-5A85B3343F99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was convened with the aim of initiating discussions between SOFI/SFN members on potential collaborative projects, and was held during the Gordon Research Conference on Solar Fuels, California, in January 2014.
