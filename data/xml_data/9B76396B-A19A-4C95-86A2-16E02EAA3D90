This method of sensor fabrication is a game-changer for the scalable manufacture of porous biosensors with novel functionalities, and will enable the design and optimisation of devices for diagnostics and point-of-care therapeutic information-gathering based on the highly sensitive detection of particular bioanalytes. 
The Nottingham contribution has been to complete the final manufacturing steps, and to assess the biosensor performance using our state-of-the-art bespoke Raman microspectrometer.

The recent discovery that heavy water can reveal mechanical contrast and thus allow hydrodynamics to be directly visualised has yielded a novel method which will be an important correlative approach with which we can independently investigate epithelial hydrodynamics using this technologically-distinct and novel approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Clark lab (SIOS) are experts in ultrasonic methods for non-destructive testing of materials. Together we have applied these methods at an unprecedentedly small scale, in order to target living biological cells. This involved the design and construction of a novel nanotransducer to launch ultrasonic waves under picosecond ultrasound interrogation, with the dual purpose of providing optical shielding from the exciting laser wavelengths which are injurious to living tissue. An entire bespoke microscope system has been created and implemented with phase contrast optics in order to perform correlative imaging with the novel method. Future work will focus on using picosecond ultrasound as a complementary method for revealing hydrodynamics to our main Raman microspectroscopy approach, which suffers certain crucial limitations in imaging at the required scales to probe dynamics across and between mammalian cells. This approach may result in a generalised method for contrast improvement or enhancement in cellular ultrasound imaging by manipulating density contrast within biomaterials - both living and fixed. As a dynamic method for assessing transmembrane or transcellular transport of fluid in living systems the method is under development, crossing engineering hurdles to make our imaging system compatible with life processes over extended periods.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have partnered with a collaborating group in Advanced Optics, led by Prof Matt Clark, and jointly developed a laser ultrasound instrument capable of revealing mechanical contrast from living biological cells at below the optical diffraction limit. Through a joint PhD supervision (Fernando Perez-Cota, viva passed in Feb 2016) we have demonstrated and applied this method to an array of biological cell types to reveal morphology and subcellular detail. We have recently extended this approach into dynamic imaging of hydrodynamics by exploiting the availability of innocuous heavy isotopes of water (D2O) in order to reveal fluid fluxes into and across cells by monitoring changes in their accoustic properties in the presence of these denser solutions.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SimPore Inc</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Epithelia-on-a-chip Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>2CEF24E7-6BFC-4A08-9056-A07E0425BC3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two travel grants have been funded, allowing reciprocal research visits by Dr Webb (UoN) and Prof McGrath (UoR) to each others laboratories.

Approximately 15 academics, 10 postgraduates and a similar number of undergraduates were brought together to focus on current themes in epithelial microdevices, with particular emphasis on the possiblities enabled by novel microporous and nanoporous membrane technologies and the ability to arbitrarily polarise epithelial tissues within devices and on surfaces.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Hermes Fellowships</gtr:department><gtr:description>HERMES Travel Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Nottingham</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D91C3DE2-4AD7-484A-B5CC-097CB00973D7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>69000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>NSF PFI:ATT</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Science Foundation (NSF)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2C3EE458-41BE-4AC3-B5C8-ED50B42531D6</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>27500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Hermes Innovation Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Nottingham</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Commercialisation of a nanoporous, re-writable, SERS biosensor</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>881100C1-A565-4335-8160-0A0B50BD89A1</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>16500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Proximity to Discovery</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>73B5DA45-0E98-4861-96EC-FDC769935665</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>34500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Whittaker Foundation International Scholars Program</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Whitaker Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E232AD73-F59D-4C10-BF86-C0A101C461D5</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We have organised the first of our annual workshops on nanoporous microdevices for physiology - this took place at the University of Rochester in August 2016. Audience included 15 academics from across the USA, local Rochester graduate and undergraduate students, invited participants from the wider photonics community at Rochester, and was be open to registration to any eligable student throughout the USA/Canada. Nottingham participants included members of the Webb lab as well as TTO representatives and collaborators on epithelial transport and physiology, and industrial collaborators from SimPore Inc, Rochester NY and Kode Biotech Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand. 
In addition to our inaugural workshop and symposium, which we are planning to repeat in Nottingham UK during summer 2017, we have instituted the third in our researcher exchance program between Rochester and Nottingham with a 9-month hosted visit of Mr Greg Madejski to Nottingham through August 2016. Mr Madejski has developed himself into a potent weilder of nanofabrication techniques to develop novel nanomaterials for cell culture and biosensing, resulting in the creation of a series of nanoporous and microporous substrates for cell culture and biosensors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7E20A5A1-A6D5-48BE-86C2-E8037C2CE4BF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A novel nanoporous membrane and method of fabrication is taught, which confers an extremely sensitive surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based sensing substrate capable of large enhancements of Raman signatures of analytes bound to its surface. The material has the ability to perform flow-through sensing and is erasible using standard electrochemistry by virtue of its electrical contiguity. The material is fabricated using silicon wafer processing, lending itself to scalable and reproducible manufacture and solving a major barrier to the high-throughput fabrication of SERS sensors in the field. Licensing arrangements are under negotiation with SimPore Inc Rochester, NY and other parties via the University of Nottingham and University of Rochester technology transfer offices.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E98064C4-CC20-494A-91AE-912B32CDC0B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have solved a major problem in the field - that of the scalable manufactur and reproducible enhancement factor associated with SERS-based measurements - allowing calibration, repeated usage, and erasible operating modes for SERS-based sensing platforms.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>Commercial In Confidence</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>PCT 62/235 929</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent application published</gtr:protection><gtr:title>Nanostructured materials</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2017</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have nucleated through this award an international collaboration spanning academic (Universities of Rochester, Nottingham) and industrial (SimPore Inc, ibidi GmBH, Kode Biotech Ltd) partners in the creation and exploitation of novel technologies in the field of epithelial microdevices. In the future these novel devices may subsitute for animal work, provide platforms for novel biosensing and bioimaging assys, personalised medicine, and novel miniaturised devices for the study and manipulation of living systems using non-invasive photonic means.
This consortium had its inaugural meeting in August 2016 in Rochester, NY and has so far shared team members internationally on 3 separate research visits and placements between Rochester and Nottingham. 
In addition, several serendipitous discoveries have been opened up to exploitation within the consortium, including novel surface chemistries, nanomaterials, and photoniclally-manipulable cell lines capable of modulating physiology non-invasively by optical means.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our consortium is working to create the physical underpinnings for novel epithelial microdevices - embodying robust epithelial tissue barriers in vitro with the aim of replacing animal work with robust, reproducible assays for tissue physiology, barrier function, drug delivery, and toxicity. Physiological parameters can be adjusted and manipulated noninvasively using light, while reading out via electrical, electrochemical, biosensing (SERS) and non-invasive Raman microspectroscopy.
In addition to mammalian and human physiology and pharmacology our non-invasive imaging methods have found application in the real-time study of water uptake and transport by living plants.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>457F50AD-D725-4B50-957C-EFA589385974</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/616D1DC3-7F50-4769-A1B8-BC9365B4FE73"><gtr:id>616D1DC3-7F50-4769-A1B8-BC9365B4FE73</gtr:id><gtr:title>Magnesium Fluoride Nanomembranes for the study of biological cells by Raman Microspectroscopy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS Nano</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/26f04a53f7567c489d9ab94e299ad9d9"><gtr:id>26f04a53f7567c489d9ab94e299ad9d9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Madeijski, G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/379D8170-52B3-4447-9CCC-871F26F632A4"><gtr:id>379D8170-52B3-4447-9CCC-871F26F632A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Thin-film optoacoustic transducers for subcellular Brillouin oscillation imaging of individual biological cells.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied optics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/32a8edc56c2d7a3a1d6e910d9b1d4ddf"><gtr:id>32a8edc56c2d7a3a1d6e910d9b1d4ddf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>P?rez-Cota F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0003-6935</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C9B641B6-6C21-467D-A316-9B6C1CF469A2"><gtr:id>C9B641B6-6C21-467D-A316-9B6C1CF469A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Optically excited nanoscale ultrasonic transducers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f7bdd0fe9638ad615fda1b25f1524a99"><gtr:id>f7bdd0fe9638ad615fda1b25f1524a99</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Smith RJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0001-4966</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M027848/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
