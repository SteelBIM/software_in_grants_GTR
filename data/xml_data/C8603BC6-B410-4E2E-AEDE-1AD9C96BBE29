We were also invited to speak at events organised by the Polish Embassy in London and by Polish community groups in the Polish Cultural Centre (POSK)
We developed a guide book to the British educational system in Polish which was widely disseminated through Polish organisations and through local authorities.
We were interviewed on radio and for the print media in Uk and in Poland.
Following on from this research we were commissioned to produce a similar guidebook for parents from other migrant and refugee backgrounds (with Action for Social Integration).

of time has created both challenges and opportunities. Schools have to balance the need to
integrate children into the classroom and the curriculum with the need to develop language
acquisition as quickly as possible. The research discussed in this report illustrates that schools
have developed different strategies for addressing these issues. Some have developed specific
programmes for induction and specialised language support. Others tend to rely on a
combination of small group work supported by teaching assistants and strategies developed by
teachers in the classroom. All of these strategies have implications for resources which are
already overstretched between competing priorities. There was also a marked difference in the
support given by local authorities. In some cases the local authority provides regular support,
information and advice, while in other cases teachers were not sure where to access the necessary
information and tools to support their work.
Many of the interviews with both teachers and parents reinforced the stereotype of Polish
children as clever, hard working and diligent. This image simplifies a far more complex reality.
Not all were able to achieve as highly as their parents expectations, and we also found some
evidence of special educational needs among newly arrived Polish children. Moreover, the
process of language acquisition is complicated and it takes longer to achieve higher level
linguistic skills than many may expect. While several parents were quite critical of the British
educational system, there was nonetheless an expectation that teachers would help Polish
children (who often arrived with no English at all) to achieve language fluency in a very short
period. Some parents, however, were appreciative of the enormous efforts being made by the
schools to welcome and facilitate new migrants.
Our study suggested that there were a number of areas in which the expectations and
understandings of teachers and parents conflicted and that this could lead to frustration which
impacted on relationships between parents and schools All the parents we spoke to were very
interested in their children's education and sought to be directly involved through helping with
homework and having regular updates on their progress. Several were highly critical about the
lack of regular feedback from teachers. Although most teachers we interviewed praised Polish
parents for their work ethic and commitment to education, most appeared unaware of the
resentment of parents at what they perceived as inadequate information about their children's
progress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research raised a number of issues and concerns and suggested policy responses for various
levels, from classroom teachers to national. Some of these would be good practice for any group
of children and parents, whether English speaking or not, since good EAL teaching is good
practice in general. While some would therefore mainly affect Polish children, in many cases we
suggest they could be generalised for other groups. Moreover, the better inclusion of Polish
children would improve the experience of schools for all, both teachers and parents.
1. Spreading good practice and knowledge
The research identified many examples of good practice and of appropriate resources in
individual authorities or schools. There was, however, a lack of awareness of these strategies and
resources by many teachers. There is a need to spread this knowledge at all levels - within
schools, local authorities, and at national and European Union level.
Local authorities have a key role to play in disseminating information, training, resources and
skills. They may also need to focus on monitoring and supporting the achievement of Polish
children across the borough. This clearly has implications for resources. It requires time for
teachers to spend outside the classroom, for example in visiting other schools and attending
training and meetings. It is also important that the EMA coordinators for individual schools are
freed up from full time classroom responsibility in order to manage this role effectively.
2. Reflecting on practice
The parents' interviews raised concerns about too rigid and early streaming of children and low
expectations of those considered to be 'low achievers'. These concerns need careful
consideration in relation to teaching practice and classroom management as a whole.
3. Teaching Resources
The availability of resources was sporadic and more could be done by schools and LEAs to
promote information about available materials to support those teaching Polish children. These
would include both Polish language and bi-lingual resources and material on EAL teaching and
on the experience of Polish children.
Polish language resources
Teachers found dictionaries and bi-lingual texts useful. Particular gaps were identified in relation
to the needs of children attempting to access the curriculum. This reflected the difficulty of
progressing from everyday or 'playground' language to more technical language. Schools and
local authorities might consider developing the following resources:
? Dictionaries which cover the topics in the school curriculum
? Dual language texts which cover curriculum related material
? Dual language stories at a higher level
? Banks of vocabulary which would allow class teachers to communicate particular
technical words
? Tests available in Polish in order to speed up the process of testing children's
ability and identifying special needs
4. Staffing
Staff identified the need for training on language acquisition for classroom teachers, particularly
to help them move children from basic to higher level. This might include a greater emphasis on
grammatical structure.40
Staff also need information on the background of Polish children, and particularly the
differences in the educational system. This may also be facilitated by projects such as establishing
links with Polish schools through exchanges.
Polish speaking staff
Polish speaking staff played a vital role in all the schools in the study. Schools should consider
recruiting Polish-speaking staff at all levels. There is, however, a danger of relying too heavily on
teaching assistants, who are both low paid and often over-worked as well as often having limited
qualifications. Training opportunities for this group are essential.
5. Engagement with parents
This can be facilitated by both written and face to face communication and through
written and internet resources, for example:
? A bank of resources in dual language which could be adapted for particular
circumstances and available electronically and as a web resource. These could include
school newsletters, school information packs, standard letters for example consent forms
for school trips. Placing the text side by side could encourage parents and children to
improve English skills.
? Information about the British school system and organisation and expectations of
parents in relation to e.g. attendance, uniform, homework. This could be provided at
induction meeting and reviewed through discussion with parents and staff.
? Meetings for Polish (and where appropriate other groups) parents on specific topics to
develop more effective communication and dispel misunderstandings. One example
could be the method of teaching maths in British schools
? Parents could be encouraged to become involved with the school through for example:
o Helping with translation and interpretation
o Involvement in wider school activities - multicultural evenings, fairs
Provision of space for parents' meetings and special activities - e.g. information and
advice sessions, English language classes, could be considered.
6. Improving the information available to parents considering migration
Polish authorities could be encouraged to be more active in the distribution of information about
the British school system in Poland to those considering migration.

As part of this project we developed a Guide to the Uk Educational System for Polish parents (also translated into Polish) which included some helpful comparisons between the UK and Polish educational systems which will be useful to both Polish families and also to British schools. Thsi Guide was widely disseminated.
As a result of this work we were approached by another community organisation (Action for Integration) which works with refugee families. They commissioned us to do another version of our Guide aimed at wider refugee and newly arrived migrant groups (not just Poles). This is an important impact from our original Polish study and shows how the results of our work have had wider benefits across other groups.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9D89AB16-C759-4A85-BB02-F19648D6B802</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://sprc.info/research-projects/past-projects/polish-pupils-in-london-schools-opportunities-and-challenges/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8871D239-9008-4A50-9176-32D88083E81E"><gtr:id>8871D239-9008-4A50-9176-32D88083E81E</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Guide for Parents on the UK Educational System (in Polish language)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/94dd56c94413985295b08516c59b8b83"><gtr:id>94dd56c94413985295b08516c59b8b83</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lopez-Rodriguez, M;
