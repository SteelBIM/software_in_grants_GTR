&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A substantial bank of motivating and attractive academic writing materials was developed,&amp;nbsp;focussing&amp;nbsp;on the genres and genre families which were identified during the original study and which are described in detail in ?Genres across the Disciplines: Student writing in higher education? (Nesi and Gardner, 2012). These materials were trialled with appropriate stakeholder groups, and made publicly available via the British Council &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/en/writing-purpose/writing-purpose&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>Learn English website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our materials will set a new standard for writing tuition, and will have the potential to change the way the teaching of academic writing is conceived internationally. 
The project is unique because it will be informed by a large corpus of authentic proficient student writing across disciplines (the BAWE corpus). The BAWE corpus is the first of its kind, and our materials will be the first to present the major categories of writing identified in this corpus, each of which is associated with several genres. A recent review of twenty popular academic writing textbooks (1) notes the serious lack of materials for teaching many of the genres we have identified; most academic writing textbooks focus on 'essays' and 'reports' to the exclusion of other types of student writing in widespread use in modern English-medium universities. 
The corpus analysis and genre classification that has been undertaken for our research project has provided us with an in-depth understanding of the form, purpose and linguistic features of university assignment genres. We will convey this knowledge within the materials we develop, and we expect this knowledge transfer to have a direct impact on universities, by improving the quality of the student experience and rates of retention, raising writing standards, and helping to relieve the pressure on subject tutors who must mark and provide feedback on assignments written by novice student writers. The materials will be made available on the British Council's Learn English website, freely accessible in most countries around the world. We will also make use of the British Council's vast educational networks and facilities to promote take-up of the materials.

Data came from the project 'An Investigation of Genres of Assessed Writing in British Higher Education', which examined thousands of proficient student assignments and proposed a system of categorising them into broad 'genre families', each with a different structure and social purpose. 
In higher education written assignment tasks are often described in very loose terms, using nomenclature such as 'essay' and 'report' interchangeably, without distinguishing the features of good writing that characterise different types of text. This is inequitable, because students from non-traditional backgrounds who have not acquired genre knowledge 'by osmosis' during their schooling may lose marks simply because they fail to produce the genre the teacher tacitly requires. 
Participants were invited to distinguish between various genre families, identify their social and pedagogic purposes, and consider ways in which genre requirements can be made clearer to students, through tutor talk, materials, and assignment briefs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/events/2015/11/hilary-nesi.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Genres of university student writing: insights from the BAWE corpus.

On July 31st 2013 we held a one-hour question and answer session on the British Council Facebook page, with language learners worldwide who were using or were about to use the Writing for a Purpose materials.

Since then regular question and answer sessions have been run on our behalf by the British Council LearnEnglish team.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4E158515-D653-426A-8BEC-B0BD443683E5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This follow-on project enables end-users to benefit from the findings of 'An Investigation of Genres of Assessed Writing in British Higher Education' (2004 - 2007 project number RES-000-23-0800). Our objectives were to: 

1. raise teachers' and learners' awareness of the types of writing produced by university students, and their linguistic features; 

2. create a substantial bank of academic writing materials; accessible via the British Council LearnEnglish website; 

3.improve the quality of student writing, thereby increasing students' chances of success and their appreciation of higher education.

For the original study we collected, annotated and analysed almost 3000 good-quality student texts, fairly evenly distributed across four levels of university study and more than 30 disciplines. These texts form the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus - see www.coventry.ac.uk/bawe. They are categorized according to their discipline and level, and also according to 13 broad 'genre families', ranging from Case Studies and Essays to Proposals and Methodology Recounts. This categorization is new, and draws attention to the existence of many types of student writing that had previously been neglected in textbooks and course materials concerned with the development of academic writing skills. 

We collaborated with the British Council to create online teaching and learning resources based on these genre families and referring to BAWE corpus data - see www.britishcouncil.org/writingforapurpose. The activities take writing purpose as a starting point, help teachers and learners to think about what university writing is for, pay attention to previously neglected genres, and provide links to relevant and authentic examples of proficient student writing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The materials are intended for use by learners of English and others who are undertaking or who are about to undertake university study in the medium of English, and who are unfamilar with the conventions of academic writing. They are also intended to be used by tutors of such students. 

The materials can be used in class or for individual study, using data projection, desktop computers or mobile devices.
