Our lack of detailed insight into the mantle stems in part from the fact that it is rarely exposed at our planets surface, making direct observation and study difficult. It is clear from recent study, however, that the mantle cannot be assumed to be compositionally homogenous or static over geological time. Peridotites from the ocean basins (abyssal peridotites) and from ophiolites preserve evidence for a convecting upper mantle that is chemically and isotopically heterogeneous at regional (100's km) and small (cm-to-m) scales. Complex formation and alteration upper mantle histories involving processes of melt-depletion, refertilisation (whereby originally refractory residues such as harzburgites become lherzolites again via melt addition) and melt-rock reaction have been held responsible, but the causes, timing and distribution of such processes are poorly resolved.

Ophiolites, which represent partially-to-wholly preserved slivers of obducted oceanic mantle, are particularly valuable resources for assessing the timing, causes and extent of mantle heterogeneity, as they allow field-based observation to be coupled with geochemical investigation on otherwise inaccessible mantle material. Furthermore, ophiolites preserve a range of oceanic mantle lithologies (e.g., harzburgites, lherzolite and dunite) and such variation allows detailed assessment of the distribution and relative timing of events acting upon the mantle that is preserved. A distinctive attribute of some ophiolites, which contrasts with abyssal peridotites, is the presence of podiform chromitite seams, typically in the region of the petrological Moho, which are often associated with Platinum-group element mineralization. The timing and genesis of ophiolite podiform chromitites is controversial, but it has been suggested that they represent zones of focused melt channeling in supra-subduction zone settings.

The Shetland (UK) and Leka (Norway) supra-subduction zone ophiolites comprise oceanic lithosphere separated at ~620 Ma on either side of a mid-ocean ridge and subsequently obducted over continental crust ~130 Ma later, each on opposite sides of the northern Iapetus Ocean. A pilot study already carried out on the Shetland ophiolite by the PI and Project Partner reveals that it preserves evidence for a complex sequence of melt depletion, percolation and refertilisation events that occurred over the lifetime of the Iapetus mantle. The critical observation made from the pilot dataset is that later mantle events only partially overprint the compositional heterogeneities developed from earlier mantle processes and that the relatively high degrees of partial melting associated with the supra-subduction zone are very effective at generating such heterogeneity. This important observation will be tested in the proposed research by 1) extending the Shetland study to greater levels of detail; 2) inclusion of a comparative study of carefully selected samples from the well-preserved Leka ophiolite; 3) drawing comparisons with existing geochemical and isotopic datasets from ophiolites that formed in other (e.g., mid-ocean ridge) tectonic settings. In order to achieve this, the powerful combination of the Re-Os isotopic system and highly-siderophile element (Os, Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt, Pd, Re, Au) abundance measurements will be utilised to discriminate between the processes responsible for generating mantle heterogeneities such as melt depletion, refertilisation and melt-rock reaction. Thus, profound insight will be gained into the chemical evolution of a piece of oceanic mantle and the development of compositional heterogeneity therein, from outcrop to oceanic plate scales, over much of the lifetime of the Iapetus Ocean.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Who will benefit from this research?
Aside from the academic community (discussed previously), this research will impact the metals industry, specifically that involved in exploration and extraction of the platinum-group metals (PGM). Other end-users who will benefit from the proposed research are Geography/Geology schoolteachers and pupils learning about Earth formation, natural heritage organizations/national trusts (particularly those responsible for the areas where the samples will be collected) and the general public.

2. How will they benefit from this research?
The PGM are amongst our rarest and most valuable natural resources and the detailed micro-scale studies of Pt- and Pd-bearing sulphides and arsenides proposed in this research will provide valuable new insight into the environments in which these metals are enriched. The current economic climate drives an ever increasing demand for mineral resources; there is every possibility that this research will generate knowledge that will inform industry policy in the exploration for and realization of precious metal resources. This expertise will help place the PI and Keele at the forefront of PGM-exploration studies, and its success will create opportunities for industrial collaboration and 'partnership-driven' NERC CASE proposals with Platinum exploration companies.
This project will provide general knowledge that impacts our understanding of Earth evolution, especially mantle evolution, and will contribute to informing scientific opinion on major paradigms such as mantle convection. Such topics are of great interest to much wider audiences than the specific academic field that carries out the research, as evidenced by frequent television 'documentary' broadcasts on subjects in the natural sciences/history in modern times. Major 'target' groups of the general public identified in the Impact Plan developed with this project are schoolteachers, pupils and tourists/visitors to the field localities studied.

3. What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?
1. The project outcomes will be communicated to the metals industry at a major international forum: the 2013 International Precious Metals Institute Annual Conference to be held in Phoenix (USA). This meeting is the premier international forum for exchange of technical, financial, economic, environmental and other industry relevant information, and attendance of the PI at dedicated PGM sessions here will enhance the project impact on the industry sector. The PI's activity and interaction with the industry sector will be supported by informal biannual consultation with Dr P. du Pusain, (PGM Ore Geophysicist, Anglo American, Johannesburg, SA) so that dissemination of project outcomes to the industry sector is effective.
2. A website, hosted on the Keele Petrology Group's space on the Keele University server, will provide details to the general public about field localities, samples and project data and outcomes. 
3. Insight gained into Earth evolution will be communicated to teachers and pupils at local Staffordshire schools via an Outreach Program organized by the PI. The program will run through the Staffordshire Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network (STEMNET), who provide professional assistance in the presentation of science to teachers and pupils at schools in a way that is interactive and 'curriculum-focused'. It is anticipated these activities will contribute to improving progression of children and teenagers to geoscience careers in the Stoke-On-Trent (North Staffordshire) area.
4. Posters and brochures will be designed for dissemination of geological knowledge and results (to tourists, the general public etc.) on site at the field localities. This will be achieved through liaising with natural heritage organisations (e.g., Scottish Natural Heritage), and will work particularly well for the Shetland Isles European Geopark.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Maryland, College Park</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Prof Richard Walker, University of Maryland</gtr:description><gtr:id>C40C84F5-7F11-4396-AA41-E46168914E1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three publications in preparation for 2015/2016 as follows: 1.

However, the PI has striven to engage in outreach activities and maximize the economic potential of the project data throughout the entire duration of the project.

As regards economic impact, this project reports on the formation and concentration of some of Earth's rarest and most valuable natural resources in exceptional detail. This is of real interest to the members of mineral resources industry, particularly those involved in exploration and extraction of platinum-group mineral (PGM) deposits. The PI has engaged with industry through forming links with FEI, who develop innovative microscopy with real applications in the exploration and processing precious metals. This link has resulted in the publication of a popular science article (Geology Today, 2014) by PI O'Driscoll and Alan Butcher (Principal Petrologist, FEI). Going forward, it is anticipated that this link with FEI will open up opportunities to engage with major platinum industry companies, such as Anglo Platinum and Lonmin. It is intended that such prospective collaborations will form the basis of future standard grant proposals.

From a societal point of view, the PI has engaged (and will engage in late 2014/early 2015) in science outreach activities, such as presenting the project results to the wider public as represented by amateur groups (see Engagements reporting section). Certain environmental considerations of the platinum-group elements have become clear during the course of the project too. For example, automobile catalytic converters are responsible for roadside metal pollution in the form of platinum and other PGE. However, the level of this pollution is poorly constrained. The geochemical and isotopic methodologies utilised in this project could be applied to examine metal particle composition and provenance, in order to quantify roadside pollution from road traffic in villages, towns and cities. The PI may therefore be able to build on the project results and methodologies of NE/J00457X/1 to apply for future large-scale grant funding to examine the environmental impacts of PGE pollution on society.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>22C171F8-7674-4F39-B66A-7CD3BA627242</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Earth's geological history has been characterised by the creation and destruction of ocean basins, driven by plate tectonics (upper mantle) convection and referred to as 'Wilson Cycles'. The Wilson Cycle exemplar is the present day Atlantic Ocean, considered to be constructed on the roots of an ocean that closed approximately 400 million years ago, called Iapetus. Our knowledge of the mechanics of these large-scale processes has evolved in the past ~50 years. In particular, our understanding of the efficiency of mantle convection has developed, from a view of the mantle as being structurally and compositionally homogenous to the current widely accepted standpoint that the oceanic mantle is likely to be heterogeneous at the grain-to-regional scales.
In this project, we have studied two 'slices' of mantle peridotite (ophiolites) that once underlay the Iapetus Ocean. We have successfully integrated the measurement of whole rock Re-Os isotopes and HSEs with in situ LA-ICP-MS data for these ophiolite peridotites. We have made the following important scientific discoveries, by carefully examining the geochronology and composition of the samples collected:

1. The oceanic mantle resembles a 'patchwork' of peridotites of different ages and compositions. In the case of the Leka Ophiolite, we have found evidence for at least 3 different mantle melting events; the oldest can be correlated over regional scales in the mantle and occurred at least one billion years ago. 

2. The terrestrial subduction cycle has a limited and apparently measurable effect on the composition of the oceanic mantle, at least for the examples studied. In addition, a compilation of all of the Shetland and Leka ophiolite harzburgite samples suggests a long term 2% variation in 187/188Os isotopic composition compared to the upper mantle as represented by abyssal peridotites. This is a significant observation that quantifies large length-scale compositional heterogeneities in the upper mantle throughout geological time. 

On the petrological side, our in situ studies of base metal phases has shown that high temperature alteration processes during subduction zone melt extraction have the potential to form minerals for which the PGE have very high affinities. Specifically, base metal arsenides and platinum-group minerals are shown to be important hosts for these precious metals. Given the comparative scarcity of these valuable resources, data such as these that inform on their partitioning behavior will be a valuable addition to the scientific literature, with a high potential to support industrial exploration and exploitation efforts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The platinum-group elements (PGE) are amongst our rarest and most valuable resources. They are vital for many modern industrial purposes, e.g., as catalysts, for their properties of hardness, chemical resistance and high melting temperature. Approximately 80% of all of the world's mined resources of platinum and palladium come from the Bushveld intrusion (South Africa; SA), but ophiolites (such as those studied here) contain important, if not typically exploitable, PGE mineralization too. This work has shed new light on the way in which the PGE concentrate in the upper mantle. Specific beneficiaries of this research are therefore the mining and mineral resources extraction industry, particularly those based in SA (e.g., Anglo-Platinum Ltd.), interested in the character and distribution of the PGE in natural rock samples.

This project's results are also societally relevant, in terms of raising science awareness and understanding throughout the general public. The project PI (O'Driscoll) has promoted a deeper understanding of scientific issues that lie at the heart of his research, such as geological time, ocean basin creation and death (plate tectonics) and mantle processes, through engaging in outreach presentations and workshops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6DE703E7-A32C-43F8-8FAF-D211DE89013F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Whole-rock major element XRF raw and processed data for all ophiolitic peridotite samples; Mineral chemical raw and processed data (electron microprobe and LA-ICP-MS) for ophiolitic peridotites; Re-Os, Pt-Os and HSE raw and processed datasets for all whole-rock samples as well as mineral (e.g., sulphide) separates</gtr:description><gtr:id>E61F3A1D-1045-425C-A80B-EFA62656CCD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.
