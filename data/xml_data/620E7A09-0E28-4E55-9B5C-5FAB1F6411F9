Testimonies from participants in the events provide evidence for the significance of the impact of the research on public perceptions in the West Midlands of the language, history and culture of the region. The participants shared several recurrent responses. The manuscript was completely unknown to many participants -- several compared the importance of the manuscript in this respect to that of the Staffordshire Hoard. Participation in the project enhanced participants' sense of pride in coming from the region and in its heritage. Learning more about the history of the regional (sometimes disesteemed) language was felt to be personally meaningful and affecting. Research on the manuscript was viewed as a way of sustaining important local traditions. Participation in the research was seen as a chance to learn more about an aspect of history they knew little about.

Brendan Hawthorne, a poet of the Black Country dialect, worked with the PI and audience to discover how the manuscript may have sounded when read aloud by its first readers. Patricia Lovett, professional calligrapher demonstrated the techniques of manuscript copying and painting. Michael Wood, TV historian, discussed the importance of the Vernon manuscript project and of engaging the knowledge of the public. The event captured the poet's and audience's knowledge of Black Country dialect and culture to add a further dimension to understanding of the manuscript; the positive impact on West Midlanders' valuation of their regional dialect was noted and discussed by the panellists in a roundtable and in audience feedback.

The event resulted in a number of enquiries for information from members of the public. It also led to plans for further similar activities.

These impacts have resulted from use of the research in various live and online activities organised in collaboration with libraries, museums, galleries and literary festivals (for details see Engagement Activities). Journalists, TV and radio presenters, and a poet have used the research to create programmes, press features and performances to inform and engage non-academic audiences (see Engagement Activities).

By means of these activities the public's awareness of the rich linguistic and literary heritage of the West Midlands has been heightened and West Midlanders' perceptions of their individual and community identities have been enhanced.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D1F7B219-728B-4455-A265-840895B42E8F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Vernon manuscript is the largest surviving Middle English manuscript. Its huge size, scope, and sensitive conservation status have proved obstacles to research which this project has overcome through achieving the project aim of producing a comprehensive electronic edition of the manuscript: The Vernon Manuscript: A Facsimile Edition of Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Eng.poet.a.1, ed. W Scase. The edition comprises an estimated 1,750,000 words and 730 hyperlinked images.

The most significant achievements from the grant were:
o Creation of the first complete edition of the Vernon manuscript text. The text edited is c. 1,250,000 words in 370 different literary works, many of them not previously edited. Annotations are provided. The text and annotations are fully searchable.
o Creation of the first complete description of the Vernon manuscript. The description covers codicological, art historical, and post-production features and comprises c. 350,000 words. A controlled vocabulary was developed for the description to enable searching. An illustrated glossary of terms is provided.
o Creation of the first full-colour facsimile of the entire manuscript. 730 high-resolution images were produced of c. 90 MB each. For the edition, the images were manipulated to enable viewing at resolutions from 12.5% to 400%.
o Hyper-linking of the edition to enable easy navigation between text and image.
o Authoring of introductory essays by members of the project team and by others; editing of the essays by the project team.

Deadlines for delivery of the content files were met and the grant objectives have been met in full as follows:

o To enhance knowledge and understanding of the Vernon Manuscript: contents; textual and codicological relations; production and reception.

The Edition includes essays on these topics, and a full list of manuscript contents with bibliographical numbers (c. 370 items). Features of the manuscript relevant to production and reception have been recorded in hyperlinked notes and the page description. 

o To enhance knowledge and understanding of problems in medieval English literature and culture, palaeography, codicology, dialectology and historical linguistics, editing, art and book history.

The size and range of the manuscript mean that the Edition is of significance for all of these disciplines. 

o To enhance access to the Vernon Manuscript by the research community and others whilst addressing conservation concerns.

Access is enhanced by the provision for the first time of a full set of high quality colour images of the manuscript, meaning that personal visits to consult the manuscript will often be unnecessary, and also by the provision of parallel transcription, description, and comment, and functions which enable users to display and navigate the materials in ways most appropriate to their needs. 

o To provide a model for the production of electronic facsimiles of large manuscripts.

The model adopted has been disseminated through various user engagement activities (conference presentations, visiting lectures, the Project Symposium).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have been taken forward by the team members and other scholars in Middle English dialectology, codicology, art history, the history of the book, and provenance studies. For example, a book edited by the PI that encompasses all of these approaches uses the findings (grant AH/H002162/1). 

The edition is also being used to train undergraduate and postgraduate students in manuscript transcription and description at the University of Birmingham and elsewhere. Research students at the University of Birmingham and elsewhere are using the edition. 

The underlying xml files are capable of further enhancement and augmentation and the PI is now using them for further research on the language and practices of the scribes of Vernon and the related Simeon manuscript (London, British Library, Additional MS 22283).

The project has generated considerable interest among academic audiences specialising in computer sciences and a series of cross-disciplinary engagement activities has identified the potential of the files to be used in research on computer-assisted analysis of digital images of heritage objects (see Engagement Activities).

The research has been used by journalists, radio and television presenters, and a performance poet to inform non-academic audiences about the medieval linguistic and literary history of the West Midlands region (see Engagement Activities). 

Talks on the edition and the manuscript have featured on the programmes of literary festivals aimed at general audiences (see Engagement Activities).

Five regional cultural organisations collaborated in offering engagement events on the manuscript for their users. These events made use of the edition and the research to provide the public with opportunities to access to an important monument of West Midlands culture.

The Bodleian Library made use of the research by collaborating in the production of an online exhibition on the manuscript. The exhibition enables the wider public to discover the research and this key Bodleian manuscript
