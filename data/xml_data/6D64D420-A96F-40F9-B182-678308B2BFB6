(resubmission)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/G012334/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Performance Matters seeks to explore the contemporary values associated with performance at a time when it has increased resonance as a cultural phenomenon, and as a concept and metaphor in critical discourse. Against the backdrop of the contemporary institutional, theoretical and market embrace of performance, the project asks whether performance is now being taken seriously in culture more broadly, how it has come to be affirmed, and how it may possess the potential to refashion the very ways in which we perform the ascription of value. \n\nProfound shifts in the cultural status and presence of performance have recently been manifested through a number of related phenomena including the museological, archival and curatorial assimilation of live art; an increased profile of performance aesthetics within visual arts, theatre and contemporary dance practice; a 'performative turn' in critical theory and cultural studies; and a re-evaluation of performance phenomena that have hitherto been excluded by, or marginalised within, critical consideration. Performance Matters will address and intervene in this context by pursuing a sustained research collaboration between key national and international academics, performance curators and practitioners. The project will be co-directed by Dr. Gavin Butt (PI) and Prof. Adrian Heathfield (CI), scholars and writers whose work jointly covers constituent disciplines in the performance field. Convened between a Department of Visual Culture and a Department of Drama, Theatre and Performance Studies, the investigation will move between different academic traditions, as well as crossing HEI and cultural sectors, with the active partnership of the Live Art Development Agency, working as co-curators in key public venues. \n\nWithin its three and a half year span, the project will move through three themed years of interlinked research activities. In its first year, working under the title Performing Idea, it will investigate the shifting relations between performance practice and discourse, event and writing, by staging critical and creative exchanges between leading international figures in the performance studies field. In its second year, under the title Trashing Performance, marginal and degraded performance practices will be explored through similar research methodologies with new international collaborators, in order to produce critical and cultural innovations through non-institutional manifestations and informal disseminations. The final year of the project, framed under the theme Potentials of Performance, will culminate its processes in a major publication that will focus on questions of performance affect, political and cultural possibility. \n\nPerformance Matters employs a series of inter-related research methodologies to explore performance as a research driver. The project combines the following modes of investigation: dialogic and creative research processes between carefully selected artists and academics; discursive exchanges in public symposia; two PhD studentships on subjects related to the project's overall themes; and educational workshops with vital artistic figures in future cultural scenes. It also ensures and extends the legacy and critical impact of these processes through a substantial and broadly disseminated publication.\n\nThe project secures a wide reception of its ideas and practices of performance research, and of performance-as-research, through these multiple forms of public dissemination. They will be of interest to an array of scholars, artists, curators, cultural workers and audiences across the fields of visual art, performance, theatre and dance. By addressing, and reaching, such a diverse and broad audience in this manner, Performance Matters seeks to generate a new field of possibilities for research on, and as, contemporary performance; one which will find further fruit in the future practices of new generations of artists, performers and theorists.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>One of the Performance Matters dialogue projects.

Artist: Robin Deacon

A series of re-enacted performances based on the works of the late American artist Stuart Sherman (1945 - 2001), a seminal though underexposed figure in the history of performance art. Described as &amp;quot;the Buster Keaton of linguistics&amp;quot;, his performances involved complex manipulations of objects that explored time, place, language and meaning. This piece explored the conundrum of Sherman's methodology through Robin Deacon's transcription and physical re-enactment of the artist's performances from the original documentation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>355CC7F2-809E-4F2C-A947-DE6BE8088B69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Approximating the Art of Stuart Sherman</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/performing-idea/robin-deacon.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous in conversation with Adrian Heathfield, Paris, September 2010.

The film records an exchange between the acclaimed and prolific author H&amp;eacute;l&amp;egrave;ne Cixous and Adrian Heathfield. Cixous discusses the practice of writing - considering fiction, theatre, the essay and poetry - alongside its relation to painting, music and philosophy. As the dialogue with Heathfield evolves, writing emerges as a site and instrument for encounters with other voices and otherness, mortality and mystery, the infinite and the 'not yet thought'.

Recorded in Cixous' home in Paris, the conversation is punctuated by various interruptions and affinities (animal and familial) that are taken into the movement of her thought. Cixous' discourse flies between subjects as diverse as the song of the poetic, the temporality of invention, the re-thinking of the tragic, and the word becoming flesh and air in theatre.

The film was first screened publicly as part of the Performing Idea Symposium and has subsequently been screened at Sophiensaele Berlin, IDans Istanbul and the Whitechapel Gallery, London.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FACDD6C4-F399-4270-B40E-687BC96CF027</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Writing Not Yet Thought is available as a DVD.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Writing Not Yet Thought</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/writing-not-yet---thought-helene-cixous-with-adrian-heathfield.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>25 October 2011: A salon-style event curated by the two Perfromance Matters studentship holders, and featuring work by associated PhD researchers from Goldsmiths, University of London, University of Roehampton, University of Bergen, and the Theatre Academy, Helsinki.

It comprises an imaginative history of performance, irreverently exploring intertwined narratives of experimental theatre, live art and cabaret.

Artists: Mel Brimfield and Various Collaborators

Brimfield's research project is based on production of the film This Is Performance Art: Part Two - Experimental Theatre and Cabaret. An accompanying live work will reconstruct and describe aspects of an extraordinary fictional live art cabaret. Within the narrative of the piece, it will be revealed that only fragments of archival material survive - these may include a number of isolated photographic documents, portions of a musical score, partial audio or film recordings, costume, prop and set elements, and interviews with artists and critics discussing the seminal nature of the work. These fragments will be produced in association with actors and performers over the course of the research project, and will be activated in various ways throughout the live work. The narrative trajectory and staging will be developed in parallel to this process. Stylistically, the piece will ape the style of 'An Audience With' TV specials, such as ITV's Kenneth Williams 1980s programmes. A monologist adopting the style of a fading performance art star accompanied by a pianist will deliver an evening of reminiscences and anecdotes about the cabaret interspersed with various live and filmed interventions, including song and dance numbers.

Early stages of production will be structured around contriving staged archival material with comedy actress Joanna Neary and students of the National Youth Theatre, dance theatre company New Art Club (Tom Roden and Pete Shenton), artist Bruce McLean, and the Beaux Belles dance troupe. The cast will expand and contract as the piece takes shape</gtr:description><gtr:id>17AC7370-78DF-4290-8B57-23273D873F2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>This is Performance Art (Part Two): Experimental Theatre and Cabaret</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/trashing-performance/dialogues.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>29 October, 2011

Artist: Marcia Farquhar 
An open-mic style performance piece in which invited guests and members of the public were invited to step up to a lectern, specially installed in a skip in the venue car park, and to 'trash' sacred cows or 'recycle' a subject already trashed by conventional wisdom.

The Open University composed of a functioning outdoor lecture theatre constructed in a roadside refuse skip, as well as an ad hoc lecture series of variable proportions, presented in situ therein, on the subject of what is and what is not trash.

One of the commissioned dialogues of the Performing Idea strand, saw JOe Kelleher engage in a roving research process around multiple scenes of European experimental theatre and Performance. The author writes: &amp;quot;The dialogue begins with the appearance of the work. A 39 year-old theatre festival, for example, in a town without a theatre; a festival that breaks with four decades of tradition in order to re-examine and renew that tradition; that addresses the urban texture not as a void that needs filling but a space of generation; that imagines a spectator in motion, whose trajectory is governed, as curator Chiara Guidi writes, by a sensation of lost powers, and by tiredness perhaps, but who may be capable of conjuring from this trajectory 'a place filled with promises.' Or else the emergence of a new practice, work still in its nascence, work being done with the young, for example a company dedicated to the non-spectacular rigours of collective dance, and to mining the minimum pause, tracing the presence of a rhythm, as director Claudia Castellucci puts it, between one beat and another. But also then the channels, the forums, the platforms of exchange through which events and practices such as these and many others are debated over and contested and sustained, by a self-reflexive critical writing, and also by a commitment, as the editors of the journal Art'O: culture and politics of the scenic arts put it, to the idea of a future of performance even in those spaces most emptied out by current ideology.&amp;quot;

This dialogue resulted in the Promises performance with Giulia Palladini and Silvia Bottiroli as part of the Performing Idea symposium.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9427E281-CFBD-4DD4-B89D-740C860C1450</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Promises</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/performing-idea/words-and-images.25.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Monday 4th October 2010 : Adrian Heathfield and Jonathan Burrows presented this performance as a result of their ongoing dialogue project on the relationship between writing and dancing.

A feature-length documentary, directed by Gavin Butt and Ben Walters, edited by Tom Frederic with music by Morgan Quaintance. A creative documentary exploring artist's DIY use of moving image technology, from use of the Portapak in the 1970s to that of pervasive media in the 21st century.

Through the moving, funny, provocative and inspirational stories of 12 unique figures, This Is Not a Dream charts a path across four decades of avant-garde experiment and radical escapism. It traces the influences of Andy Warhol, John Waters and Jack Smith to the perverted frontiers of YouTube and Chatroulette, taking in subverted talk shows and soap operas, streetwalker fashions and glittery magic penises along the way.

The film is based on exclusive interviews shot in London, New York and Berlin with Dickie Beau, Dara Birnbaum, Nao Bustamante, Vaginal Davis, Cole Escola, Vincent Fremont, Alp Haydar, Holestar, David Hoyle, Kalup Linzy, Glenn O'Brien, and Scottee.

The video revolution of the 1970s offered unprecedented access to the moving image for artists and performers. New worlds began to unfold: you could talk back to the mainstream by hijacking its images and upending its values; you could reach out, through the camera, to fellow freaks; and you could create dreamscapes to explore other ways of being. This Is Not a Dream charts the lineage of this revolution and its continued impact on contemporary art and performance.

Over the last few years, choreographer Jonathan Burrows and writer and curator Adrian Heathfield have developed a dialogue around the relationship between writing and dancing. Mostly the dialogue took place in artist's workshops where they found some ways to experiment with elements of speech and movement in performance processes with performers. They were interested in exploring the creative tension between the distinctive affects of embodied actions and spoken words, investigating their different roles in the making and receiving of meaning. They were fascinated by those moments of intensity - unforgettable yet unspeakable - where something of life is disclosed between sense and sensibility. For their dialogue as part of Performing Idea, Jonathan and Adrian initiated a process of creative exchange, sometimes working with others, sometimes together, sometimes alone, where they are able to push these questions further.

The letters arising from this process of collaboration are published on the Performance Matters website at:

www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/performing-idea/words-and-images.26.html

The dialogue also resulted in a separate performance: &amp;quot;holding them in front of you&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>86E9AB61-09AC-461A-A74F-EDC75BDFB727</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Moving - Writing</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/performing-idea/dialogues.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>G.Butt, A.Heathfield, L.Keidan (eds.), Performance Matters Archive, Live Art Development Agency, London &amp;amp; The British Library, 2013, ISBN 978-0-9570149-9-2.

One of the commissioned Dialogues of the Performing Idea strand, Etchells' research project In Silence convened a series of encounters with experts and professionals whose daily work and life practice leads them to an interest and investment in silence. Silence - death to the comedian, transcendence to the priest, a right in the eyes of the law - is after all not the negative space of speech but rather a complex piece of social communication, which functions in contexts as a statement, as transitional state (instrumental route to something) and indeed as a goal or objective all of its own. In a series of conversations Etchells explored the diversity and complexity of silence as it is constructed and read, investigating both its utility and its blankness.



This dialogue resulted in the In Silence performance-dialogue as part of the Performing Idea Symposium.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0462E1CE-BD46-4659-A4C9-9FBAD3B2E381</gtr:id><gtr:impact>.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>In Silence</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Tuesday 5th October 2010
A double bill by Augusto Corrieri &amp;amp; Owen Parry
Part of an ongoing investigation into solo performance, Musical Pieces explored the deceptive qualities of perception and attention offered by the theatre, playing with different forms of on-stage concealment and trickery.

I Wanna Be in that Show was a performance about wanting to be in a performance. It drew on the feeling of seeing a performance and recognising one's own desire to be in it or to have created it. It was about art that drives you to make more art, to revel in its forms and textures and to question the bodies that occupy it.</gtr:description><gtr:id>91B95728-2411-4A03-939A-E68CBC065D80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of PhD studies and career development for the performers.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Musical Pieces / I Wanna Be in That Show</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A filmic artwork that emerged out of Oreet Ashery's workshop, 7-11 September 2011, undertaken as part of Trashing Performance.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A9E92C3-A0D2-434F-AC05-019850D622E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>..</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Party for Freedom</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/trashing-performance/Workshops.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2011</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Live Art Development Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Performance Matters with the Live Art Development Agency</gtr:description><gtr:id>83CF33AD-D0A7-4390-A8DB-DEEC9C820264</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See all outcomes associated with Performance Matters as a whole.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>LADA were the key public-sector collaborator on Performance Matters providing directorial, programming, publicity, planning and many other kinds of expertise and in-kind support.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>A three year programme of creative research events - involving symposia, workshops, commissioned dialogues, screenings and performances - on the cultural value of performance.

Numerous multi-form research exchanges (through creative workshops, collaborative dialogue processes, symposia, talks, screenings and performances) involved an international array of leading academics, artists, activists and curators, significantly influencing prevailing professional discourses and creative and curatorial practices across arts sectors. Specific professional development effects were delivered for a select culturally diverse group of early-career artists. Impact was also noted for the main non-academic partner-organisation, LADA, through the development of its educational and archival activities and expansion of its user community.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A6BCAC35-BE88-4762-805E-3B9206192BA3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project made three key contributions to rethinking the shifting values and status of performance in the contemporary cultural landscape.

Firstly, Performance Matters organised a wide and diverse range of contributors to foreground creative practices which fall beyond the scope of work routinely programmed and exhibited in cultural institutions such as museums and galleries. This demonstrated the agendas of performance practices somewhat remote from institutional legitimation, and re-located the values of performance in work sometimes overlooked or dismissed as being too open-ended or process based, too difficult, and / or too popular and trashy to warrant 'serious' consideration. It also brought unlikely contributors into dialogue in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural explorations of the values of performance.

Secondly, as a creative research project, Performance Matters exemplified multiple innovative modes through which the values of such an expanded field of performance practice can be demonstrated and disseminated. Foregrounding live and transactive encounters, alongside forms of creative and scholarly output such as films, events, and journal publications, the project embodied the possibilities of performance itself as a practice of knowledge. Its diverse types of outputs reflect the different ways in which performance values what it knows.

Thirdly, as a public-facing research project, Performance Matters located its findings in trans-active exchanges between the academy and public culture. It involved contributors and performance audiences that hitherto had been remote from academia, thereby expanding the stakeholders of contemporary performance research to those beyond HEIs, whilst simultaneously authorising creative dialogue and performance processes as research methods within the academy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AF4AF6BB-578A-439C-9934-FE246BD3F6BF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.thisisperformancematters.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/89531E2E-2550-4740-BBBC-679736987F2E"><gtr:id>89531E2E-2550-4740-BBBC-679736987F2E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Visual Cultures as Seriousness -
