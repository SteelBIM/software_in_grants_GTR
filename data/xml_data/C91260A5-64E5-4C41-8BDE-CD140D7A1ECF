Music</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K009559/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The Centre for Digital Music (C4DM) at Queen Mary University of London is a world-leading multidisciplinary research group in the field of Music &amp;amp; Audio Technology. Established in 2001, and now with over 60 members, including academics, research staff/fellows, research students, and regular visitors, we are arguably the largest group in this area in the world. Much of our research is within the important RCUK Digital Economy / Communities and Culture theme, and our core competence in Digital Signal Processing has already been identified by EPSRC as &amp;quot;important to the UK&amp;quot; and an area for growth. The UK has the largest creative sector in Europe, and one of the world's largest music industries (CBI: Creating Growth, 2010).
Over the last 5 years, the music industry has undergone massive changes, with new digital and streaming services such as Spotify opening up new opportunities for startup businesses and SMEs, as well as large-scale music research. In parallel with this, as part of a strategic investment in creative technology and digital media at Queen Mary (&amp;quot;qMedia&amp;quot;), we have expanded our group to strengthen our expertise in music perception &amp;amp; cognition, music &amp;amp; language, and performance, to complement our existing strengths in signal processing, music informatics, and interaction.
This aim of this Platform Grant is to provide underpinning funding to allow us to continue to take a strategic view of our research. Our short- and medium-term strategy is threefold: &amp;quot;Music is out there&amp;quot; (Exo) plus &amp;quot;Music is in here&amp;quot; (Endo), built on underlying core competencies such as in digital signal processing (Core). We will do this through: undertaking adventurous feasibility studies, allowing rapid progress towards our strategic objectives; retaining strategic skills in Key RAs, maintaining important strengths and competencies in the group; strengthening our international links and building new interdisciplinary links through internship and outreach activities; maximizing the impact of our research through a new knowledge exchange strategy, including business partnerships and reproducible software and data; and undertaking public engagement activities to promote our research to a wide audience. We will also continue to help our RAs successfully develop their careers towards academia or industry, through activities such as mentoring, guest lectures, event organization, exchange visits and training courses, and we will also introduce new mentoring schemes for Investigators to maximize their potential.
Over the 5 years of the proposed Platform Grant, this concerted programme of research will achieve a step-change in modelling of human music processing and in its application to challenging industrial-scale digital music opportunities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Potential beneficiaries of the research supported by this Platform Grant outside of the academic research community include anyone who could benefit from latest research in audio and music.

Amongst these was Tape.pm by CDT-funded PhD student Victor Loux, an interactive object which explores novel ways to record and share an improvisation that is created on a musical instrument (at S&amp;oacute;nar this was Collidoscope, another C4DM research project). 

Report from Victor Loux:
&amp;quot;Tape.pm is a project that developed during my Masters' advanced placement at b00t consultants, that links with the Collidoscope (developed by Ben Bangler and Fiore Martin) which was also shown at S&amp;oacute;nar and I helped with setting up. Tape.pm explores novel ways to record and share an improvisation that is created on a musical instrument (at S&amp;oacute;nar this was Collidoscope). Tape.pm was praised by attendants at the conference for its simple and creative approach to recording - and that it encouraged further exploration by the attendants. As such, the design of the object is purposefully ambiguous to encourage this exploration.

The exhibition of Tape.pm at S&amp;oacute;nar+D allowed me to gain first-hand access to public feedback about this piece and to gauge general interest and reactions and to observe how people engaged with it as well as to take notes about how to improve its design. Importantly, doing so at S&amp;oacute;nar+D allowed me to place myself in a professional context at an international event and to engage with a much more focussed audience - people attending were specifically interested in audio and interaction.

Outcomes: this initial testing with an international audience at S&amp;oacute;nar+D, which was largely composed of non-musicians, allowed me to formulate more specific questions and testing goals for a further formal study in a controlled environment that happened a few weeks later. Because Tape.pm gives a take-away &amp;quot;souvenir&amp;quot; code, I was able to use web analytics to analyse the actual usage and timings of people using Tape.pm even after the event finished, and use this data as a basis from which to form more realistic conditions for a controlled &amp;quot;lab&amp;quot; study. The outcomes of the observations S&amp;oacute;nar+D will be used in the APP report for this project.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>FA4E3114-ED71-4768-96E3-B175F52774B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tape.pm was praised by attendants at the conference for its simple and creative approach to recording - and that it encouraged further exploration by the attendants.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>C4DM project Tape.pm at Sonar+D 2016.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://sonar.es/en/2016/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>RTSFX (Real-Time Sound Effects) is an online library of real-time synthesised (rather than sampled) sound effects for a variety of different objects and environmental sounds;</gtr:description><gtr:id>A95EF9E7-3E71-4E76-9720-5C9C8BD1D963</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Report from Will Wiklinson, C4DM PhD student:

For our RTSFX project, the most encouraging thing was the number of people that interacted with our sound effects demo and how easily they grasped the concept, even if they had no experience in the area.

Around the same time / just after Sonar our sound effects website was presented to industry professionals (sound designers working on film/tv), and observing so many non-technical people playing with the site at Sonar helped me understand better the way people will interact with it and lead to some tweaks being made to make the experience more reliable and enjoyable.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>C4DM RTSFX project at SONAR+D 2016 festival</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://sonar.es/en/2016/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>At the Study Day, C4DM researchers Elaine Chew (MuSA_RT visualisations of tonal space), Andrew McPherson (Magnetic Resonator Piano), and Andrew Robertson (B-Keeper and its family of beat trackers) presented their technologies and underlying research and theories.

Open Symphony promotes person-person engagement and allows the social benefits of music-making to foster a meaningful mutual experience. The idea was conceived to acknowledge and capitalise on a listener's ever-growing digital presence within live music settings; designing a system to resolve the disconnect between reality and digital-reality and transform digital technology's possibilities to encourage active creative experiences.

Western performing arts practices have traditionally restricted creative interactions from audiences. Open Symphony was designed to explore audience-performer interaction in live music performance assisted by digital technology. The Open Symphony system transforms the traditional unidirectional musical chain by adding creative communication in the reverse direction, from the audience to performers.

During the project, the system was experienced by about 250 audience and performer participants in controlled (lab) and &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; settings. Feedback on usability and user experience was overall positive and live interactions demonstrated significant levels of audience creative engagement. We identified further design challenges around audience sense of control, learnability and compositional structure. Both audience and performer participants who trialed the system felt challenged by the novelty-audience members took creative decisions and decoded their effects, and performers followed scores generated while they were playing. Such challenges lead to positive affective responses for some audience participants, who felt engaged in the performance and closely connected to performers, and to frustration for others, who misunderstood the system or wished to have more control. Open Symphony showed the potential to create performances that are &amp;quot;open,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;engaging,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;empowering,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unusual&amp;quot;. Our results highlighted the potential of our system for music pedagogy and audience engagement agendas.</gtr:description><gtr:id>35BD4EFE-1A57-4128-B131-B647F0B6C669</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Platform Grant (PG) funding enabled to (i) evaluate and improve our participatory performance digital technology by collaborating with performers and audiences outside academia through focus groups and concerts, and to (ii) disseminate our research as part of public engagement events (about 250 participants) as well as academic publications.

Our audience can be segmented into expert musicians and non experts from a wide range of domains (school, university, creative industry, design, engineering, administration) and age (11-50+). Thanks to the Platform Grant, our work was published and presented in the tier 1 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), 7-12 May 2016, California (USA). We collaborated with musicians from University of California Berkeley and organised a series of interactive performances and an evaluation study at CHI 2016. This helped strengthen an ongoing publication which was accepted in a high impact factor journal in our field after we included the new results we obtained thanks to the grant (IEEE Multimedia Magazine, Impact Factor February 2017: 1.36).

The PG award also allowed two PhD students to attend talks on state-of-the-art in Human Computer Interaction from top universities and companies on a variety of topics, such as ubiquitous computing, visualization, usability and user experience design. This proved a useful source of inspiration for the students' PhD research directions.

We have also raised the awareness of QMUL and our EPSRC FAST-IMPACt Program Grant project at the international ACM CHI conference by showcasing short demo videos from our group at the booth.

The award supported the participation of QMUL PhD students Yongmeng Wu and Leshao Zhang in the tier 1 ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), 7-12 May 2016, California (USA).

We hired professional musicians (eight in total) for our concerts using complementary funding sources (AHRC Audience Labs and QMUL Centre for Public Engagement grants, PI: Barthet).

The internship provided a valuable opportunity for broadening van der Weij's experience and extending his network. Similarly, the visit to Queen Mary provided an opportunity for researchers at the Music Cognition Lab to be introduced to the research done at the Music Cognition Group in Amsterdam.

Thus, the objectives of the research internship were: 
1) Integrating a novel model of rhythm perception into the IDyOM framework, under supervision and guidance of Marcus Pearce, who originally developed this framework;
2) Kicking-off a partnership between Bastiaan van der Weij and Marcus Pearce, who acted as co-supervisor during van der Weij's stay at C4DM.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding from the Platform Grant has allowed C4DM to offer a three month research internship as part of the &amp;quot;Internship scheme to attract excellent PhD students and RAs from other universities (from a few days up to 3 months).&amp;quot; Bastiaan van der Weij's stay at C4DM was partly covered by the University of Amsterdam and partly by C4DM.

For his PhD research, van der Weij is working on a probabilistic model of rhythm perception, using methodologies very similar to those used by Marcus Pearce in his IDyOM framework. Both models are probabilistic and incremental models whose parameters are estimated from a large body of data. Both models aim to model the flux of listener's expectation as a piece of music unfolds, as a function of that listener's earlier musical experience. Both models use predictive distributions and information content to quantify these expectations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Piraeus</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Greece, Hellenic Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>MIREX Music/ Speech Classification and Detection Task</gtr:description><gtr:id>32A91490-9CB4-492D-B227-BCB759938D06</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The following outputs and outcomes were recorded:

This is informing music technology education. The multitracks, mixes of those multitracks and evaluations of those mixes are all used in a large multitrack audio testbed. This testbed is used by music technology researchers, educators and students, in order to improve music and audio mixing.

The C4DM researchers found out how and why reverberation is added to tracks in a mix. We have devised a metric, the equivalent impulse response, which is strongly correlated with how multitrack reverberation is perceived, and is meaningful for analysis and interpretation.

The C4DM researchers are also investigating how mixes are made and evaluated by the students and educators at the Catholic University of Portugal, and comparing the results with similar experiments performed at other institutions across the world. This ongoing work will help us understand how music mixing practices are influenced by culture and region.

A C4DM open source software tool, the Web Audio Evaluation Tool, was improved and updated based on its use in this project.

This research visit was expected to contribute to new data resources collected from NYU and affiliated institutions and is also linked to a grant proposal, written by professor Armand Leroi, Imperial, in collaboration with Queen Mary.

 During Maria's stay at New York University between 22 May and 15 August 2016 she had the opportunity to meet with people from both academia and the industry. In particular she attended a meeting between academics of New York University and NYU Abu Dhabi discussing potential collaborations between their institutions and Queen Mary. Following this meeting she has been invited to attend the 3rd workshop on &amp;quot;Cross-disciplinary and Multicultural Aspects of Musical Rhythms&amp;quot;, Abu Dhabi, 17-20 March 2017, as a way to keep the NYU-QM collaboration going. What is more, she attended local events held at Spotify New York and she presented her work to industry-related audience promoting research of Queen Mary University of London. 

The findings of this work are summarized in a research paper (see next section) that has been submitted to the 42nd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing 2017. The work focuses on the characterisation of singing styles in world music and includes the development of a software package and an interactive visualization.

A pop-up Bela workshop was held at the New Interfaces for Musical Expression conference in Brisbane. While not originally in the schedule, the Centre for Digital Music received a last-minute invitation to host the workshop given the interest of many of the participants of the conference. During the workshop, the 20 participants were introduced the basic usage of the platform and their specific questions about Bela as a teaching tool were answered.

Bela, an embedded platform for audio and sensor processing, was developed at C4DM. During this trip Giulio Moro from the Centre for Digital Music got in touch with manufacturers, to plan for future orders and with the community of users, notably gathering interest for it being used as a teaching tools in universities around the world. Meeting manufacturers SeeedStudio and Elecrow in Shenzhen allowed to plan for 
the future of the hardware manufacturing of Bela. Useful feedback was gathered from the participants of the workshop in order to improve the ongoing hardware and software development of Bela, which is carried on at C4DM. 

The Centre is now close to creating an Augmented Instruments Lab spin-off company with the support of QM Innovation, with the main aim of commercializing Bela and support other projects from the lab. 

The Centre for Digital Music gathered interest from teachers at University of Virginia (Travis Thatcher, Peter Bussigel), Griffith University of Brisbane (John Ferguson, Andrew Brown, Toby Gifford), University of West of England (Chris Nash), Staffordshire University (Si Waite) who are interested in the use of Bela as a teaching tool for their classes in sound design and digital musical instruments.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BeagleRT workshop Imperial</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1278DAFD-76A2-4878-BC97-BF775BFB9B12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organised audio programming workshop at Imperial College Advanced Hackspace, to happen 14 November.

Sonar+D is a high-profile annual exhibition of music technology attended by thousands of industry professionals, musicians and members of the general public. C4DM was chosen by competitive application for a booth on the exhibition floor. We showed 9 recent research projects supported by EPSRC funding (EP/K009559/1, EP/K032046/1, EP/G03723X/1). The booth attracted significant interest from a broad cross-section of the Sonar audience: it was nearly full for most of the three days, and anecdotally appeared to have more traffic than most of the booths at the exhibition. In parallel with this in-person exhibition, Sonar+D featured C4DM in their social media feeds, and we were interviewed for a broadcast on Spanish television. Aside from public engagement, the exhibition led to several new industry contacts, and it provided valuable feedback to the attending PhD students and postdocs on how to showcase their research in public.

The projects shown were:

1) Bela, an open-source platform for ultra-low-latency audio and sensor processing, which launched on Kickstarter in 2016;
2) TouchKeys, a transformation of the piano-style keyboard into an expressive multi-touch control surface, launched on Kickstarter in 2013 and spun out into a company in 2016;
3) Collidoscope, a collaborative audio-visual musical instrument which was a viral hit online with over 10M views;
4) RTSFX (Real-Time Sound Effects), an online library of real-time synthesised (rather than sampled) sound effects for a variety of different objects and environmental sounds;
5) Moodplay, a mobile phone-based system that allows users to collectively control music and lighting effects to express desired emotions;
6) Augmented Violin, a sensor-based extension of the traditional violin to give students constructive feedback on their playing
7) Tape.pm, an interactive object which explores novel ways to record and share an improvisation that is created on a musical instrument;
8) Aural Character of Places, an interactive online demo of soundwalks conducted around London;
9) MixRights, a demo of how content reuse is enabled by emerging MPEG standards, such as IM AF format for interactive music apps and MVCO ontology for IP rights tracking, driving a shift of power in the music value chain.

Several potential collaborations may result from this visit, including commercial opportunities related to the TouchKeys and Bela projects, and possible joint projects with other university labs who attended (e.g. IRCAM and the Music Technology Group at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona). The publicity surrounding this exhibition may also serve as a recruitment tool for future research students in the Music and Acoustic Technology research area.

A particularly valuable outcome, especially for the PhD student attendees, was experience in showcasing their research to the public. Several students commented that they received valuable feedback on their projects and learned general skills in public engagement over the course of the three days. In one case (Tape.pm), interactions with the public helped generate a dataset which will be analysed in future research.

Finally, attendees at Sonar+D also had the opportunity to see other booths and talks at the event, generating new ideas and connections for future projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sonar.es/en/2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Second workshop on Intelligent Music Production (WIMP2)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE2909E9-9924-49CD-B6F7-917E13FB96C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Audio Engineering and Music Production are inherently technical disciplines, often involving extensive training and the investment of time. The processes involved implicitly require knowledge of signal processing and audio analysis, and can present barriers to musicians and non-specialists. The emerging ?eld of Intelligent Music Production addresses these issues via the development of systems that map complex processes to intuitive interfaces and automate elements of the processing chain.The first workshop on Intelligent Music Production was hosted by Birmingham City University last year, with support from QMUL's Centre for Digital Music. There were no plans or strategy for continued activity. With the support of the Platform Grant, the organisers hosted and organized the second workshop, greatly expanded the activities, and laid the groundwork for future events, funding, dissemination and collaborative activities. 

The 2nd Workshop was hosted by the Centre for Digital Musi, Queen Mary University of London. It took place on the 13 September 2016, It had over a hundred participants, including some from Japan, USA, Norway, Germany and France. It included people from academia, industry and some from the wider public. It was promoted widely. It had a twitter feed (still active) and videos from the event have been uploaded to two YouTube channels. The event provided an overview of some of the tools and techniques currently being developed in the ?eld. It also delivered insight for audio engineers, producers and musicians looking to gain access to new technologies. The day consisted of presentations from leading academics, industry keynotes, and additional posters and demonstrations.

Activities in the workshop included further promotion, development and update of our Open Multitrack Testbed. Some talks in the workshoo, both by others and by C4DM people, made use of this testbed.

There were 23 publications, 5 of which were from C4DM;

Three (3) academics and ten (10) students attended the workshop. 

The following posters were presented from C4DM:
* Doing it Wrong: Towards an understanding of the roles of error, risk and fiasco in DMI design for performance by Astrid Bin
* Measuring Affective, Physiological and Behavioural Differences in Solo, Competitive and Collaborative Games by Daniel Gabana Arellano
* Intelligent Machine Music Listening: An Experimental Approach by Francisco Rodr&amp;iacute;guez-Algarra

* Automatic Expressive Feature Analysis by Luwei Yang
* Automatic detection of outliers in world music collections by Maria Panteli
* Physically-Musically Inspired Probabilistic Models for Audio Content Analysis by Pablo A. Alvarado
* Building self-contained digital musical instruments with active tactile feedback using Bela embedded audio platform by Robert Jack
* Robust and Efficient Joint Alignment of Multiple
* Musical Performances by Siying Wang

After the morning poster session, the group got a chance to see the latest research of the Music Technology Group including designs of new musical instruments, analysis techniques for non-Western music, and computer-assisted monitoring of a musician's movements during performance.

A group of three (3) students and two (2) academics also had the chance to visit Hangar (https://hangar.org/en/), an arts centre in Barcelona. Marta Garcia, the Director of the Research Programmes, showed the group around the making facilities, studios, video editing suite, and audio synth studio.

The most significant impact was potential research collaborations formed between UPF and QM students who met each other at the workshop. At least one student from QM is considering taking a research visit to UPF. There were also discussions of ongoing exchanges such as inviting UPF students to take part in future EECS research showcases.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://portal.upf.edu/web/etic_doctoral_workshop/home</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hunan University Summer Camp Public Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20470047-6174-4016-9854-501ADF0B1207</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ben Bengler and Nick Bryan-Kinns from C4DM, Queen Mary, took part in the two week Hunan University Summer interdisciplinary project on Social Innovation in which they led a team of QM and Chinese students to develop interactive audio and visual pieces with local Dong minority musicians for public performance in rural China. It was a highly adventurous piece of research work - creative interactive objects in a remote rural location in China with minority cultural groups. It was quite a significant piece of public engagement and interdisciplinary co-creation with rural Chinese participants. The key findings of the research were the development of methods to engage rural populations in co-creation.

The Platform Grant funded Ben Bengler for 3 months to produce high quality video and website to promote the work of the Summer Camp and to catalogue and collate the video and images collected during the Summer Camp to help with writing of research papers. Ben Bengler also contributed to the writing of a full paper for SIG-CHI 2016 conference (the leading conference in the field), and to our submission to the QM Public Engagement Award 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~nickbk/NewChannel2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interactive Workshop at QMUL's A Mind of Music festival: Open Symphony (M.

Open Symphony was designed to explore audience-performer interaction in live music performance assisted by digital technology. The Open Symphony system transforms the traditional unidirectional musical chain by adding creative communication in the reverse direction, from the audience to performers.

Approximately 80 local East London school students attended this creative workshop at Queen Mary University of London during which they learned about music making and conducted performers using the Open Symphony mobile app. Students actively engaged in the activity and their tutors reported it had fostered a lot of interest and discussions in class after the event.

The most significant outcome from this activity is to have sparked the interest of young people in contemporary music helping them to understand music better and bridge the gap between them and performers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>D-Box presentation FabLab Cardiff</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>38317154-CD79-48CE-909B-4274291BD1D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented the D-Box hackable instrument at FabLab Cardiff (Cardiff School of Art and Design), with an audience including arts students and members of the &amp;quot;maker&amp;quot; community.

The project employed L&amp;eacute;na Delval as a research assistant on a fixed term contract for 4 months. L&amp;eacute;na is now applying for PhD positions. The project consisted of a Live Science Residency in the Science Museum - Pearce and Delval spent 5 weeks in the Museum running experiments on musical preference with visitors to the gallery. The purpose was twofold: first, to facilitate data collection and second to engage the public with our research. Between 11/11/15 and 11/12/15, the Live Science Residency attracted 371 visitors ranging in age from 8 to 78, who often came as families specifically to take part in our research and find out more about musical preferences. 

Pearce and Delval intend to publish their data which includes a large and well-validated public dataset of emotion and preference ratings for music in a range of different genres. This may be used to support future research in music emotion recognition and modelling of musical emotions and preference decisions. They also expect this work to lead to one or more journal articles. Work on these will commence once the analysis of the data has been completed.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Music Cognition Seminar (Aalborg, Denmark)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C06B19E3-8E21-4016-9AA0-25B109B0783D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr K.

This inaugural series was made possible, in part, by generous support from the centre's EPSRC Platform Grant for Digital Music.

The Classical music stream, directed by pianist and operations researcher Professor Elaine Chew, offers boundary-crossing concerts juxtaposing classical music with C4DM technologies and other art forms. The New Interfaces stream, directed by composer-violist and new instruments designer Dr Andrew McPherson showcases augmented instruments and interfaces developed at C4DM in concert. The Fixed Media stream, directed by computer music composer and electrical and computer engineer Dr Bob Sturm highlights electro-acoustic compositions enhanced by digital music technologies.

C4DM already has a world-leading reputation in research. Through the concerts, which are free for the public to attend, C4DM research and researchers have benefited from public exposure and being able to test and validate their technology &amp;quot;in the wild&amp;quot;. The concert series demonstrates the potential for C4DM to be a driver for musical innovation in London and to have a more prominent profile in the larger arts community. Working with external musicians to present these concerts presents scope for future collaborations.

These are the concerts that have taken place so far:

1) Art Inside Music (curated by Paul Edlin, QMUL music director), Thursday 22 October 2015, full performance: 40 mins (part of Some Things Rich and Strange, an Inside Out Festival and Music@QMUL event)
Arno Babajanian's epic Piano Trio in F# minor performed by Elaine Chew (piano), Hilary Sturt (violin), and Ian Pressland (cello), with music-driven spectral art created by Alessia Milo. Babajanian's dark, ethereal, and wild trio is illuminated by specially designed vectorial drawings created in Processing, playing with time, light, darkness, colours, frequencies, and their spectral energy. The spectral art was generated in real-time in response to the music and projected on the musicians.

2) New Interfaces Concert (curated by Andrew McPherson and Astrid Bin), Wednesday 4 November 2015, full performance: 120 mins
Laurel Pardue performed on an augmented violin with live visuals. Dianne Verdonk performs on &amp;quot;La Diantenne&amp;quot;, a new metal-sheet instrument capturing rich gestural interactions. Tim Exile performed on his &amp;quot;Flow Machine&amp;quot;, a hardware/software setup for live sampling and transformation of sound. Bogdan Vera and friends performed on the D-Box. The performance was coupled with a study of audience response conducted by C4DM/MAT PhD student Astrid Bin. The audience was introduced to the instruments before the performance and record their responses during the performance using a web-based system developed by Astrid.

3) Computer Music! by Stephen Travis Pope and other deep neural networks (curated by Bob Sturm), Monday 23 November 2015, full performance: 90 mins
Featuring music by Stephen Travis Pope, Oded Ben-Tal, Dan Stowell, and Bob L. Sturm

4) Musical Banditry (curated by Elaine Chew), Monday 21 December 2015, full performance: 60 mins
As Stravinsky famously said, &amp;quot;Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.&amp;quot; The art of stealing was illustrated by Bob Sturm's Concatenative Variations of a Passage by Mahler and by Paul Lansky's Etudes and Parodies (winner of the 2005 International Horn Society competition) for horn trio as performed by Joel Ashford, Hilary Sturt, and Elaine Chew. Part of Lansky's piece was compared to the Beatles' While My Guitar Gently Weeps, as performed by Florian Guillaume, Giulio Moro, Keunwoo Choi, and Elio Quenton, culminating in a concurrent performance of the two. Musical similarities were made explicit using C4DM research in music informatics.
 
5) Chinese New Year Concert (curated by Luwei Yang), Monday 1 February 2016, full performance: 120 mins
The Chinese New Year Concert was organised jointly by the Chinese Students' Association (CSSA) and Confucius Institute at Queen Mary and not only celebrates Chinese New Year, but celebrated the fusion of arts and science at Queen Mary, combining music and performance with digital instruments. The event featured award-winning Chinese instrumentalists, C4DM members and the Magnetic Resonator Piano and the Mood Rater music technology.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/c4dmconcerts1516/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2006,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8FDC4670-A804-45FC-933D-8C2FC9021951</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The C4DM team (M.

Despite being a world-leading research group, C4DM did not have a media influence at the image of its academic and scientific excellence. The production of an inspiring promotional film was a first contribution towards a better outreach effort from C4DM. More specifically, it is formulated in accessible plain English and is displayed on the home page of C4DM website in order to generate public awareness, communicate research outcomes, disseminate knowledge and encourage public engagement and dialogue. Given its accessible character, it is also a valuable asset to reach potential partners outside of our academic niche as well as prospective students and researchers. 

The production of this films grants C4DM the ability to engage with a non-expert audience in a systematic way. An interesting by-product of this is that it also rose awareness about public engagement paradigms within C4DM researchers.

Collidoscope was shown at Ars Electronica as part of the Ars Electronica u19 Festival 2016. Exhibitions were open from 10am to 7pm on 8 September 2016 to 12 September 2016 (5 full days). Ars Electronica requested &amp;quot;hands-on sessions&amp;quot; and that the participants would &amp;quot;experiment their musical creations&amp;quot;. The target audience was under 19s, so the sessions were highly interactive, and required substantial advanced planning (it was not meant to be a demo or showcases). 

One of the outcomes of this activity is a future ongoing collaboration with Ars Electronica.

During the project an adult focus group of 100 people was recruited. 59 participants completed the study, submitting all three surveys over a 6-week period whilst also playing the game and exploring the app content. In addition, over 3,000 short surveys were collected from players around the world. 35GB of Gameplay data was collected from over 45,000 users of the app. 

An important part of the continuation and development of this project is outreach. The team are still in the early stages of this work but have already contacted a number of schools, with some positive response, to present a workshop on the app that they have developed &amp;quot;Steve Reich's Clapping Music&amp;quot;. The workshop will aim to engage young students (11-16) in a musical genre they may not yet have experienced (Minimalism) which we hope they will continue to explore through the app. They also plan to run sessions on the process of developing the app at events such as 'Get into Tech' which aim to encourage young adults to consider a career in technology. The app was developed through an interdisciplinary project team of researchers, technologists and musicians, to transform a piece of music into a game to encourage learning and skills acquisition. The research team hopes to stimulate thinking on how to transform an idea into a compelling game. 

The team are working with The London Sinfonietta, an orchestra specialising in contemporary music, with a strong relationship with Steve Reich, to develop the workshops that will be offered.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>QMUL Centre for Public Engagement small award (PI: Mathieu Barthet)</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>78EDF9F9-533A-45B3-AA32-F80992BF31CC</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>897000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Early Career Fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/N005112/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A21116A0-A3BE-41B7-80F7-F601BFC3DDAB</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>676850</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>European Union (EU)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>EUR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Austria</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>de_AT</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Horizon 2020 (H2020-ICT-2015)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>European Commission (EC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>Proposal number 688382</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>1AC1A37A-95E2-4ADF-80CA-B09497CE7800</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Soundbite is an iTunes plugin developed under this project.

This is an open source software framework that works with its own plugin architecture called VAMP. Sonic Visualiser is Free Software, distributed under the GNU General Public License (v2 or later) and available for Linux, OS/X, and Windows.

Sonic Visualiser is intended for use by people in various academic disciplines, but also by non-academics, professional audio users, and interested hobbyists. It supports loading additional analysis plugins that other developers or institutions can publish, and at least 10 institutions (besides QM) have chosen to publish plugins in this format. Sonic Visualiser was first published by the Centre for Digital Music in 2007 and has been continuously developed at the Centre and maintained as free, cross-platform open-source software ever since.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4670BC01-3C3A-4F2B-AB60-EFD6E62B610A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>According to our ongoing user survey that has been carried out since the start of 2014 (having 1053 responses to date, all from people who were actually using Sonic Visualiser at the time):

 * 49% of respondents use Sonic Visualiser primarily in a personal capacity, 10% for professional work, 33% in academia at some level (the rest &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;);
 * 46% use it primarily in the field of musicology or music analysis, 19% in music composition or production, 16% in audio engineering or signal processing, 5% in software development, 2% speech processing (the rest &amp;quot;other&amp;quot;);
 * 55% said they found it &amp;quot;very enjoyable&amp;quot; to use and 41% &amp;quot;moderately enjoyable&amp;quot;;
 * 27% said they found it &amp;quot;very easy&amp;quot; to use and 62% &amp;quot;moderately easy&amp;quot;;
 * 59% of respondents had some additional analysis plugins installed on top of the default configuration; among these respondents, the mean number of additional plugin sets installed was 3.4.

Sonic Visualiser's version-update-checker logs keep a count of distinct IP addresses from which SV has been used (for users who have agreed to this). They show over 138,000 distinct addresses during the past year, with around 4,000 distinct addresses per week on average.

An impression of the extent of usage can be gained by viewing illustrative Youtube videos about sound analysis made by third parties:
at a quick scan I count at least 100 that show Sonic Visualiser, of varying quality. Sonic Visualiser has also been used in online course material, such as the popular Coursera &amp;quot;Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications&amp;quot;, as well as in courses for academics in non-technical disciplines, such as the Digital Humanities at Oxford Summer School.

This is a free, open source project; it was used as an Impact Case study for REF 2014.

It is a resource intended for but not limited to users such as researchers in MIR and intelligent music production, as well as sound engineering students and audio software developers. The researchers' aim is to realise the testbed's potential impact by including the most popular multitrack datasets around, complemented with extensive metadata. The idea of publishing a multi-track database has been raised several times and a few prior attempts have been made within the Queen Mary researchers' group. The project is led by Brecht De Man, who collected audio files for a number of multi-track recordings. Gy&amp;ouml;rgy Fazekas (FAST IMPACt) advised on semantic technologies, having developed the Studio Ontology Framework which is being used in the testbed. Mariano Mora-Mcginity (also a FAST IMPACt team member) finished developing the testbed (barring solving any issues that may arise during the annotation) to a state in which it 
1. shows all content for the user to browse through; 
2. has a search interface to search and filter using any of the metadata fields; 
3. allows an authorised user (password protected with customisable permission) to enter new metadata associated with audio on the testbed server (c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/ multitrack) or elsewhere on the web. 

The C4DM team has annotated over 600 multitracks have been annotated, comprising over 3000 individual tracks. Full details have been maintained about the instrumentation, genre, recording process, artifacts, attribution.... This is a sufficient number for this data to now be used in machine learning and data mining applications. It is contributing to research on music mixing practices and multitrack audio processing.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0282803-58D3-4B28-9D3A-29C53893893D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several researchers have referenced the testbed in their papers since its inception, and it was well received during a session on multitrack audio datasets of the Unconference at 15th Conference of the International Society for Music Information Retrieval in Taipei, Taiwan, November 2014. Furthermore, within C4DM the local multitrack repository is extensively used for research, but as the licenses are not open - or unclear - disseminating data and results is less than straightforward. This is especially a problem when funding bodies, journals or conferences require open data for sustainability and reproducibility purposes. The research team is positive that this resource, the first of its kind, has the potential of becoming the main resource for any researcher, student or developer who needs multitrack audio and mixtures thereof, provided it has the critical mass to become appealing as a go-to platform. It is evident that there is already a strong support base for this idea, and already extensive usage of the still limited dataset. 

Multitrack audio is a valuable resource for a wide range of audio professionals, educators, students, developers, and researchers. Many of these communities are not that aware of C4DM and its activities. Notably, this project is expected to have significant impact with music technology students and educators, who will use the content in learning and teaching music production skills. R&amp;amp;D areas in which large and diverse sets of high quality, multi-stream audio are essential in music information retrieval (MIR) research, development of improved music production tools, and tasks like audio source separation, audio segmentation and research in auditory perception.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Multitrack Testbed (Team: QMUL)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multitrack.eecs.qmul.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Media Value Chain Ontology model for time-segments and multi-track audio including reference software and conformance datasets will be published by ISO/IEC MPEG in due time as: &amp;quot;ISO/IEC 21000-19 AMD 1 Extensions on Time-Segments and Multi-Track Audio&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8888737-828A-45CA-AA51-C4D4B95771A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) Research tools (incl. conformance bitstreams aiming for achieving interoperability among emerging music services) for music interaction, learning, creation and sharing using IM AF are made available at: https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/mpegdevelopments;

It can be used to build musical instruments, including the D-Box hackable musical instrument developed for the EPSRC Hackable Instruments project. The software is of particular interest to audio and music researchers, especially those building real-time systems.

With less than 1ms of latency between action and sound, Bela performs faster than any other computer-based environment on the market, including high-spec laptops. It also features audio-rate sampling of every analog and digital input which makes design of sensor systems convenient. In 2015, a built-in browser-based IDE was added along with support for the Pure Data graphical computer music language widely used in the digital music community. Since 2016, we have continued to add support for other programming languages and hardware accessories, as well as extending the documentation and online resources available to the community.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BF20B56-4C06-4502-876E-ACA2193F3330</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bela has gained significant traction amongst researchers, musicians and hobbyists in the 2014-17 period, with the number of users and community members growing every month.

On 29 February 2016, we launched a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for Bela, seeking &amp;pound;5k to build and distribute the hardware. We exceeded our funding goal in less than 4 hours (out of a 32-day campaign), ultimately raising &amp;pound;55k from over 500 backers. Following the campaign, we received invitations to collaborate from major academic institutions (IRCAM in France, STEIM in the Netherlands, University of Virginia, University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow, Goldsmiths University and several others) and industry (Cycling74, makers of the popular Max/MSP software). 

Meanwhile, since 2014 we have held 10+ workshops on Bela and/or the D-Box instrument including 2 workshops at the Sonar music festival, a workshop at the NIME 2015 conference (Baton Rouge, LA, USA), an Audio Music Hackathon sponsored by Harman Audio, and an Accessible Music Hackathon with the charity Drake Music (held at QMUL). Following the successful Kickstarter campaign, we spun out a new company, Augmented Instruments Ltd, to commercialise the platform, and relaunched a public web shop in October 2016. We maintain several community resources, including a blog, wiki, web forum and several social media accounts. Our users actively contribute to these resources and frequently share projects they make using Bela. Community development itself has become an area of research for us (e.g. Morreale et al., &amp;quot;Building a maker community around an open hardware platform&amp;quot;, Proc. CHI 2017), and we have received a grant from Innovate UK (Feb-Oct 2017) to further develop the platform and build our community.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Bela Audio Platform</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://bela.io</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The Collidoscope is a unique hardware device and real-time granular sampler/synthesizer for collaborative performance and exploration that was developed as a side project by C4DM researchers (Ben Bengler and Fiore Martin).

Thresholds for horizontal and vertical lines can also be defined. It is particularly aimed for animation and sound applications, and for use with drawing surfaces (such as Wacom tablets or touchscreen interfaces).

Possible uses:
1 audio effect or EQ envelopes;
2 animation curves;
3 creation/manipulation of audio and/or visual sequences;
4 arpeggiators.
Compatibility: openFrameworks 0.9.0

A sequence of 3 shapes and tones (&amp;quot;ShapeTones&amp;quot;) is played, and the player tries to reproduce it. Tapping different areas of the screen trigger different ShapeTones. The game starts with 3 ShapeTones. As the game evolves, more ShapeTones become available. When a new ShapeTone is added, a trial screen is shown to demonstrate where each ShapeTone is triggered. Some surprises happen along the way. As a one player game, the sequence is created automatically. As a two player game, one player creates the sequence, passes the device to the other player, who tries to repeat it. They then swap the roles.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FA2757F1-2E1E-4277-93EE-BAF4DD1307ED</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not currently known.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>iOS Crossmodal memory game: ShapeTones</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://depic.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/?q=shapetones</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>AccessibleSpectrumAnalyser is a real time spectrum analysis plug-in that allows visual impaired users to inspect spectrograms using the same sonification as the accessible peak meter.

Our AccessiblePeakMeter is the first plug-in which makes these previously inaccessible meters completely accessible. It uses real-time sonification to deliver information to the user about audio levels and peaks in audio signals, and so supports core activities in audio production.

The AccessiblePeakMeter comes as a VST, AU or AAX plug-in, two of the main industry standards for the deployment of digital audio effects into professional DAWs (e.g. Cakewalk Sonar, Cockos Reaper, Ableton Live). The plug-in can be run on both Windows (32/64) and Mac platforms and it is free for download and completely open source.

The winner were announced on Sunday July 26 2015, the day of the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.

AccessiblePeakMeter was also featured in the issue 19 of the Computer Science for Fun magazine, which explains the AccessiblePeakMeter in a bright, simple and effective way.
