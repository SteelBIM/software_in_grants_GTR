Data</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M010236/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Edward Snowden's leaks about the extent of US and UK intelligence services' electronic surveillance dramatically demonstrated how in an increasingly digitised world, technological developments and the collection, storage and use of 'big data' pose unprecedented challenges for the protection of human rights. The aim of this programme of research is to ensure that the use of technological developments and big data are compatible with the ideals of human rights protection and can even have a positive impact. 

Snowden's revelations are part of a much bigger picture in which electronic monitoring and data is collected and shared by companies and states on a routine, daily basis through social media, consumer activity and smartphones. The same technologies that threaten our privacy also provide opportunities for enhanced protection of human rights through better documentation of human rights violations and by demonstrating the effectiveness of rights-shaped policies in order to influence resource allocation and budgets. 

Existing work either fails to consider the rights-implications of the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and big data or focuses on a particular right. What is missing is a wider investigation into the diverse and complex rights-implications (positive and negative) of the use of ICT and big data including, but not limited to, privacy and the many social, ethical and legal issues lurking beneath the surface of human-machine interaction and use of big data. Moreover, regulation of the use of ICT and big data is currently fragmented between states, the United Nations and internet governance sector. This project will provide added value by offering a fuller picture of the totality of human rights issues raised by ICT and big data to advance new thinking and regulatory solutions. 

The research questions focus on issues that cut across the threats and opportunities:1) How is the use of ICT and big data shaping the content and scope of rights? (2) How does the use of ICT and big data shape operational practices across state and non-state activities? What new theoretical questions and implications for human rights are generated? (3) What methodologies are needed to identify and document the misuse of modern technologies and the failure to comply with rights-based obligations? (4) How can the use of ICT and big data best support evidence-based approaches to human rights protection and advocacy? (5) What possibilities and limitations exist for regulating the collection, storage and use of ICT and big data by states and non-state actors? 

The project will be organised into 4 work streams. The first (WS1) will focus on the overarching and synthesising themes. This will be complemented and informed by three in-depth studies: state and non-state surveillance (WS2); health as an example of using new technologies and big data for accountability purposes and evidence-based approaches to rights (WS3); and human rights advocacy and humanitarian work (WS4). The project will use multiple methods (desk research, interviews, econometrics, comparative case studies and computational techniques). 

Communication and impact streams will be developed across the different stakeholder communities to establish agreement and a shared vocabulary by forming an expert working group of practitioners (human rights and technology), international internet governance, UN actors and academics that will meet twice a year to develop international standards on information technology, big data and human rights. 

Dissemination and engagement with academics, practitioners and the public will be achieved via an interactive website; social media channels; conferences; public events; academic publications; shorter practice-orientated articles, policy briefings and blogs; media pieces; and time sensitive interventions targeting key policymakers and influencers and international, regional and national courts.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's research findings will primarily benefit four key communities: 

(1) International human rights and humanitarian institutions (particularly UN agencies - we do not have letters of support as it is not UN practice because of their independence and impartiality): the project will provide them with increased capacity to understand the multifaceted human rights implications of technology and big data; to respond to and effectively regulate the challenges posed by information technology and big data to human rights; and increased capacity to understand and use technology and big data for the mapping, monitoring and documenting of situations of acute crisis. 

(2) States: the project will benefit states by informing their efforts to regulate non-state actors' development. The research will provide state actors with a better understanding of the importance of the human rights' aspects of states' use of technology and how to choose the best way to regulate states' collection, storage and use of technology and big data. 

(3) Technology industry: technological advancement offers new opportunities and the technology industry is a key driver and facilitator. The research findings will improve their understanding of the potentially adverse effect on human rights, through due diligence and self-regulation. This will raise the visibility of such issues in technology design and use. Both national (Institute of Engineering and Technology and British Computer Society) and professional bodies (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Association for Computer Machinery) that provide guidelines for professional system developers and engineers in the area of technology would benefit from the outcomes of this project and would enable them to develop conduct guidelines for professionals compatible and supportive of human rights.

(4) Human rights organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations: organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have long been aware of the downside of technology and how the development of new technologies and availability of big data sets poses serious threats to human rights and the ability of regulation to keep pace. The same organisations are also using information technology and big data to verify/falsify human rights violations allegations and struggling to understand how to effectively deal with the vast amount of data produced through social media. The project will help these groups to understand the threats and opportunities and the limits and challenges that technology and big data can pose for human rights advocates.

These four communities will be involved in the design and implementation of the programme from the outset in order to ensure its relevance to their work. A major benefit will be that the project will provide multiple opportunities and pathways for these actors to come together to share information and best practice and develop innovative and connected solutions, including on regulation, to the issues identified. Until now they have tended to work in unconnected ways at different levels (national, regional, international) thus hindering opportunities for effective regulatory response. 

The project will also benefit the media and general public, including through an interactive website, where there is a high level of interest in the issues raised by this research. Big data has been lauded as a transformative resource that can be used to benefit researchers, organisation, and society in general. However, as the recent Snowden revelations revealed there is another side to the story. Snowden reignited debates about privacy and surveillance, government use and abuse of data, and revealed the threats and opportunities that advanced technologies and big data provide. The project will be able to provide valuable evidence-based input about the human rights dimensions of this ongoing debate.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4743734</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Human Rights in the Digital Age: The Promises of Big Data and Technology (Part I) (Authors: Vivian Ng and Catherine Kent)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00C0A220-BDA0-4776-AD28-8C29AB01A55F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Co-authored introductory blog by Vivian Ng and Cath Kent on the promises of big data and technology for human rights in the digital age</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hrbdt.ac.uk/human-rights-in-the-digital-age-the-promises-of-big-data-and-technology-part-i/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The future of human rights in a multi-polar world: exploring opportunities for further engagement (Wilton Park) (Dr Ahmed Shaheed)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC84B836-0E89-4481-89BF-ED4DEB45B617</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Ahmed Shaheed has participated in a meeting organized by Wilton Park, in association with the Swiss Federal Department for Foreign Affairs, the Finnish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Brookings Institution and Global Affairs Canada, on 'The future of human rights in a multi-polar world: exploring opportunities for further engagement', held on 11-13 January 2017, where he chaired a session on 'Ensuring accountability and transparency: maintaining freedom of information'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.wiltonpark.org.uk/event/wp1515/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Official Launch of the Project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E8DE114-7ABF-4A9C-907D-DFC33AFAD747</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Official launch of the Project in London, including an overview of the Project's research and a keynote lecture delivered by Ambassador Eileen Donahoe, Director of Global Affairs at Human Rights Watch, followed by a Question and Answer session.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.essex.ac.uk/events/event.aspx?e_id=10029</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transatlantic Dialogue on Cyberespionage, Surveillance and the Protection of Privacy in the Digital Age Conference (Professor Lorna McGregor)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A184377B-95DA-45D8-96F3-F0D29950492F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Lorna McGregor participated as a panelist in the &amp;quot;Transatlantic Dialogue on Cyber-espionage, Surveillance and the Protection of Privacy in the Digital Age&amp;quot;, hosted by the Robert S.

The conference analysed relevant practices and policies on both sides of the Atlantic, compared and contrasted constitutional and other pertinent domestic legal frameworks and discussed the public international law implications of these activities with a specific focus on the application of human rights law in cyberspace.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Big Data and the Right to Health: Explaining Ourselves!</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6AC2ACF-9255-4916-971E-0D2ECC2E79B7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This blog was written by Dr Carmel Williams and Professor Paul Hunt to introduce the broad concepts of the right to health, human rights, and their role within the HRBDT</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://hrcessex.wordpress.com/2016/11/22/big-data-and-the-right-to-health-explaining-ourselves/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Human Rights Commission (NZ) workshop on Big Data and Human Rights</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5F60F55F-40D0-40A6-A745-7488DF483037</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Paul Hunt and Dr Carmel Williams were keynote speakers at this workshop which brought together 25 participants predominantly policy makers from various government departments in New Zealand.

The submission summarised the opportunities and risks associated with the police's adoption of 'data driven technologies,' which aid the bulk collection, storage, and analysis of data about persons, places, and practices. Data driven technologies can improve the efficiency of police work by offering law enforcement agencies methods of analysing crime data and generating predictions about crime that is yet to take place. For example, police can use data driven technology to make decisions regarding the most-effective allocation of scarce police resources. However, existing research indicates a series of risks that must be considered when adopting data driven technologies. This submission highlights three risks associated with data driven technologies, focusing on: the quality of the input data, the potential for discriminatory decision-making, and privacy harms. This blog recaps the conclusion of our submission by highlighting the risks associated with data driven technologies used to predict crimes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hrbdt.ac.uk/data-driven-policing-highlighting-some-risks-associated-with-predicting-crime/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at Federal University of Pernambuco, located in Recife</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C210CDC-51A8-4979-9EE3-A4CBF96AA63B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research seminar discussing evaluation of the family health programme</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Using Technology to Facilitate Human Rights Work (Author: Sam Dubberley)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>846A55F1-FE09-4A01-90A3-94B6B79172F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a blog post discussing the possibilities of using digital tools to advance human rights and improve humanitarian work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://hrcessex.wordpress.com/2016/12/07/using-technology-to-facilitate-human-rights-work/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Verification and the Battle for Aleppo (Author; Sam Dubberley)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D012D53F-AF31-4DB0-9683-15EDAB0CF8C0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sam Dubberley talked about the advantages of using reverse image search to detect human rights violations and strengthen human rights fact-finding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://medium.com/lemming-cliff/digital-verification-and-the-battle-for-aleppo-55d004f289d5#.2y0rjhrz1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Computing Multiple Systems Estimation in R (Author: Patrick Ball)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EBC4D573-AABB-4A47-838B-CA81CA27A101</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a semi-technical introduction to estimating undocumented events by using multiple, intersecting datasets.
