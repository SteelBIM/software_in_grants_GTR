It will seek to interrogate the assumption that open and efficient channels of communication are always of greatest benefit to science and to society. It aims to draw the attention of the research community to the creative importance of silence, of interruptions in communication, of isolation and of 'stuckness'.

Discussion of the theory and practice of science communication typically emphasises the removal of barriers (for example, between scientist and citizen) and the reduction of distortion (scientific inaccuracy and misrepresentation in the media). Restricted access to scientific knowledge becomes the object of moral censure, whilst maximised communication is frequently taken as an unquestioned social good. 

However, science - and its communication - depends as much on discontinuities, on barriers and lacunae, as it does on the free flow of information. Contrary to the ideal of science as an open enterprise, scientific innovation and scientific commerce rely on the constant use of moral, legal and technical devices that restrict, rather than encourage, the sharing of ideas. For instance, Information Property Rights procedures close off the flow of information to the scientific community, even as they enable the subsequent commercial development of an idea. Likewise, fear of plagiarism can radically restrict scientists' willingness to discuss their work openly.

Humanities scholars from a range of disciplines have drawn attention to the constructive role of silence - from the meaningfulness of pauses and omissions in literature, to the role of solitude and quietude in the history of religion, or the uses of silence within the legal system. However, to date such interests have been sporadic and largely directed towards disciplinary interests. In particular, there has been no attempt to draw on this work to inform the study of the practice and communication of science.

The Silences of Science research network will bring together a range of scholars - for instance, from literary studies, media studies, legal studies, religious studies, as well as from the history and philosophy of science, policy studies and science communication studies - who are able to draw on insights from their disciplines in order to develop a conceptual framework with which to examine the role of silence within the sciences. The workshop format facilitates interdisciplinary collaboration and is intended to stimulate novel research among the academic participants.

The network will also include practising scientists and those working in science policy, with the aim of informing research communication practice and policy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Policy makers: 

Invited participants to the final workshop of the Silences of Science series will include science policy practitioners such as policy officers in government or at scientific institutions like the Royal Society. This workshop will critically examine issues such as the necessary limits to open access and open data (building on the notion of 'intelligent openness' set out in the recent Royal Society report), the impact of impact assessments on scientific practice, how scientists can manage Freedom of Information requests, and other issues that scientists confront in the communication of their research. 

The ideas of the workshop series will also feed into the current debate among science research funders on the ethical understanding of scientists and of their host institutions and which asks questions about measurements of productivity over the long term.

The findings of the workshop series will also be disseminated to those working in research policy through reports in outlets such as Research Fortnight. 

Public audiences and cultural industries:

The collaboration with Wellcome Collection will inform the possible production of outputs aimed at public audiences. Wellcome Collection has extensive experience of experimenting with culturally contextualised displays of scientific ideas. Science museums are often noisy, busy spaces but Wellcome Collection, in targeting adult audiences, has the capacity to display science within a contemplative space. Through the Collection's input, the theorisation of silence therefore has the potential to inform exhibition practice. Output inspired by the research network may include a 'silent' public event at the Collection.

Public audiences will also be addressed through an experimental audio production composed of silences extracted from scientific discourse. The production, which will be available through the project website, will draw listeners' attention to the silent content of conversation and the different textures and qualities of these silences. By taking the silences of scientists, it will emphasise the hesitations and periods of reflection entailed in scientific practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>23681</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An audio production exploring the nature of silence was commissioned as part of the project.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E9C78CD8-CBBE-4456-9121-EA9B2E39B121</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The audio piece was performed during the workshop series and afterwards attracted the attention of two sound art bloggers.
