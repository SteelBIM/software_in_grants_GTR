&lt;p>Employing quantitative as well as qualitative methods, the project covers both public and private forms of risk protection, and analyses attitudes towards risks and contingency cover as well as actual risk management behaviour. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Comparing England and Scotland, we aim to review Britain's current 'mixed economy of welfare' in key areas: unemployment, sickness, costs of higher education for children, retirement and infirmity in old age.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will map the types of statutory protection against such risks and contingencies and examine changes in the scope of public provision. In parallel, we will examine the scope of non-statutory (occupational and personal) provision, investigating how 'private welfare markets' have developed since the early 1990s. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The second phase is based on quantitative data analysis of household savings and investment behaviour in insurances and private market-based contracts for risk protection. Finally, via qualitative interviews, we explore personal risk management of socially and economically similar families from Scotland and England. This stage will also explore the potential ramifications of the most recent financial uncertainties and economic downturn.&lt;/p>

Stage A of the project demonstrated how low public entitlements are across policy areas (pensions, sickness, unemployment, long-term care and also support for the cost of higher education), and how significant non-state provision is for middle income households. However, neither systematic public information nor academic studies exist that would allow a comprehensive assessment of the quality of non-state benefits by types of employer or sector. The situation is somewhat better with regard to pensions, but here, too, specific information is rare. Welfare markets are opaque and householders make decisions without access to comparative information.



The secondary analysis of large scale survey data showed that private insurance markets play only a small part in the security packages of the English and Scottish population. This has not increased over the past 15 years. In particular, long term care insurance is held by less than one per cent of even our core group of better-off families, who were more likely to hold private insurances than other households. With the exception of the recently discredited MPPI, and life insurances, holding private insurances against income loss due to unemployment or sickness largely remains a niche behaviour, often correlated with high occupational status and high income. Survey data made available by the Association of British Insurers suggest that there is a strong reliance on various other private sources of income protection, such as the ability to curtail expenditure, to draw upon property wealth or turn to family and friends. A search of publicly available survey data also revealed gaps in the information available in terms of how parents might be saving specifically for children's education and in terms of occupational income protection (sickness and redundancy).



Public provision was almost absent in the perception and actual risk management strategies of middle income households. In a range of cases, most notably regarding pensions, householders did not expect any public benefits. Nevertheless, many interviewees felt protected because of their large public or private employers. On the whole, couples relied on occupational benefits more than on any other form of income protection. 

Regarding pensions, unemployment and sickness, 'monos' relied on their employer exclusively; and those with confidence tended to be older and had higher incomes. 'Duos' combined occupational provision with one other source of income protection: insurance, savings, property or work. 'Multis' (generally with heterogeneous employment careers) relied on a patchwork of protection. 

Most couples felt not much affected by the financial crisis. Among those materially affected, most felt capable of adjusting their circumstances. Only very few suffered a loss but did not have the capacity to respond. Out of the five areas the need to pay for children at higher education was singled out as the most relevant area of income management by two thirds of all respondents. Interestingly, there were no systematic differences between Scotland and England in this or other areas.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>For policy debates on the role of private insurance, as well as occupational welfare in the areas of sickness and redundancy pay.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C24E7C8E-347B-4D32-B7EB-6248DF702913</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.socialpolicy.ed.ac.uk/research_projects/welfare_markets_and_personal_risk_management</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F23B5496-E204-4522-86E9-161F1F7507E4"><gtr:id>F23B5496-E204-4522-86E9-161F1F7507E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>DIY&amp;nbsp;social&amp;nbsp;policy&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;case&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;unemployment&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;what&amp;nbsp;do&amp;nbsp;British&amp;nbsp;households&amp;nbsp;do?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e30a0982331510a1672d9d9a70ea77c1"><gtr:id>e30a0982331510a1672d9d9a70ea77c1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jochen Clasen (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9AEC2BC2-44C1-4957-9630-618E6679B98C"><gtr:id>9AEC2BC2-44C1-4957-9630-618E6679B98C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Income Security During Sickness Absence.
