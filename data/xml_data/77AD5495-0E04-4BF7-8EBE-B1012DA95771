Blood pressure is regulated by the diameter of the arteries through which the blood flows around the body. The diameter of these vessels is actively controlled by a surrounding layer of smooth muscle cells. Contraction of vascular smooth muscle narrows the arterial diameter and increases blood pressure. Conversely, its relaxation lowers blood pressure. On the inner wall of the artery is a layer of endothelial cells that regulate the function of smooth muscle. One of the important regulators of the contraction/relaxation process in vascular smooth muscle cells is a class of proteins known as ion channels, tiny gated pores that allow ions (such as potassium) to move into and out of the cell. The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels play a particularly important role in regulating the function of the cardiovascular system. A key feature of these channels is that their opening and closing is regulated by changes in the metabolic state of the cell. This is because they are modulated by the intracellular concentration of ATP, the molecule that serves as the energy currency of the cell. In the heart, KATP channels are especially active in times of cardiac stress, such as when blood flow is compromised (ischemia), and they help to protect against heart attack. In smooth muscle, however, they are important in regulating the resting level of vessel tone, and thus the diameter of the blood vessel. When these pores are open, vascular smooth muscle cells relax, lowering the blood pressure; when they are closed, contraction is favoured and blood pressure increases. Mice that lack KATP channels can die from a type of coronary vasospasm known as Prinzmetal syndrome that is also found in humans. It is therefore very important to understand how the opening and closing of the KATP channel is regulated. The aim of my studies is to determine the molecular mechanisms that underlie the function of vascular KATP channels, to elucidate how these are regulated by the energy metabolism of the cell, and to explore how mutations in KATP channel genes cause vascular disorders. I will use a number of experimental techniques to address these questions: from measurement of the passage of ions through a single ion channel to genetic modification of the KATP channel. I will also explore how drugs regulate vascular KATP channels. Such studies will provide us with a better understanding of how this channel operates under normal conditions and what goes wrong in disease states. They may also facilitate the development of novel drugs for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and angina.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>KATP channels couple the metabolic state of the cell to its electrical activity. In vascular smooth muscle (VSM) they modulate vessel tone, thereby playing an important role in blood pressure regulation. Endothelial KATP channels may also contribute to the regulation of the vessel tone indirectly, for e.g. via modulation of endothelin-1 secretion. Vascular KATP channels play also a role in pathological conditions such as toxic shock (sepsis) and mice lacking of Kir6.1 have increased mortality towards endotoxin. KATP channels are octameric complexes of four Kir6.x and four SUR subunits. In VSM and in the endothelium, the predominant channel is composed of Kir6.1 and SUR2B. There is now substantial data on the relationship between the structure and function of KATP channels containing Kir6.2 subunits (cardiac and pancreatic b-cell channels). However, similar information on Kir6.1 channels is surprisingly sparse. Despite significant sequence homology (~70%), Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 channels have very different biophysical properties, including single-channel conductance, inward rectification and regulation by intracellular Mg-nucleotides. The overall aim of this project is to understand the molecular properties of vascular Kir6.1 channels. This will not only illuminate the relationship between the structure and function of Kir6.1, but should also provide insights into the properties of Kir channels in general and into how SUR interacts with Kir6.x. A secondary aim is to begin to elucidate the role of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle KATP channels in normal and pathological conditions (such as sepsis). The specific goals are: i) identify structural features that account for the functional differences between Kir6.1 and Kir6.2. ii) characterise Kir6.1/SUR2 mutations associated with cardiovascular disorders. iii) address the physiological/pathophysiological roles of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle Kir6.1-containing channels in ex-vivo preparations.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-12-07</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>399358</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Meet the Physiologist&quot;,  Manchester Museum of Science and Industry (MOSI).</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE6BB8F9-830A-40F5-8C6F-467B512CAD8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Organiser (together with six other physiologists from the University of Manchester).

High blood pressure (hypertension) is a health problem that affects about a quarter of the adult population worldwide and is a risk factor for stroke and heart disease. If untreated, hypertension results in premature death due to consequential damage to major organs like the brain, heart and kidneys. Blood pressure is determined by cardiac output and by the resistance to blood flow within peripheral blood vessels. The diameter of these vessels is actively controlled by electrical impulses travelling through the layer of muscle cells that form the wall of the artery. These impulses are caused by specialised proteins in the cell membrane known as ion channels, because as they open and close they allow charged ions to move into and out of the cell. 

A large and important group of ion channels are the potassium channels, which are selectively permeable to potassium ions. The ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels, play an important role in regulating the function of the cardiovascular system. A key feature of these channels is that their opening and closing is regulated by changes in the metabolic state of the cell. This is because they are modulated by the intracellular concentration of ATP, the molecule that serves as the energy currency of the cell. In heart cells, KATP channels are especially active in times of cardiac stress, such as when blood flow is compromised (ischemia), and they help protect against heart attacks. In arterial muscle, however, they are important in regulating the resting level of vessel tone, and thus the diameter of the blood vessel. Too much activity of KATP channels leads to low blood pressure, whereas too little can lead to vessel constriction and increase blood pressure. 

The KATP channels found in arterial muscle differ in their composition from those found in the heart and other tissues. One aim of this study was to determine the molecular characteristics of the arterial KATP channel that make it different from its cardiac counterpart, and what determines its metabolic sensitivity. My team has used a number of experimental techniques to address this question: from measurement of the passage of ions through a single ion channel to genetic modification of the KATP channel. We have also discovered that one of the causes of chest pain syndromes and myocardial infarction in man is due to a genetic mutation in the gene coding for the arterial KATP channel and we have identified a drug agent that may help correcting the molecular defect. These studies have provide us with a better understanding of how the vascular KATP channel operates under normal conditions and what goes wrong in disease state. They will also facilitate the development of novel drugs for the treatment of diseases such as hypertension and angina.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The knowledge of the role of KATP channels in the vasculature that we have obtained during this project indicates that this channel could be exploited as a therapeutic targets for diseases associated with impaired vessel tone such as hypertension, angina and sepsis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>685BDA8E-EC2A-4286-AA8A-9EC0B3B34693</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have generated a homology model of the pore forming subunit of the vascular ATP-sensitive potassium channels (Kir6.x).
