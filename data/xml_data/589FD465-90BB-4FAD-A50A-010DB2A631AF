Although surgery is widely perceived as a scientific field, making sense of this intersection is not the province of science alone. This proposal argues that arts and humanities can provide crucial viewpoints that are usually absent within the discourses of surgery, offering a rich interplay of perspectives to illuminate societal challenges and tensions around the balance between patient-centred caring and the demands of technology and science. \n\nThe proposal brings together experts from arts, humanities and surgery to explore the operating theatre as a complex site for cultural research. By developing the theme of 'surgical humanities', the project will explore the potential of art as a means of capturing multiple dimensions of clinical experience. Because access to actual surgery is severely limited, immersive simulation will provide a safe setting which offers the promise of a new expressive medium for such exploration, building on pioneering work by the PI. Low-cost yet highly realistic surgical environments (for instance using an inflatable operating theatre equipped with authentic instruments and recorded sounds) can recreate many complexities of actual surgery. This work is already giving rise to widespread interest as an educational and public engagement approach.\n\nBy standing as proxy for actual clinical events, simulation can recreate something that closely reflects reality (while providing protection against harm), allowing non-clinicians to 'experience' and start to understand what happens during operations. In a wider sense, however, it may also offer a new expressive medium in its own right, allowing artists to manipulate and experiment in ways which would be unthinkable in the real environment. By interpreting the clinical setting through the eyes and ears of visual artists, musicians and design engineers (working closely with clinicians and patients), we believe that new understandings will be generated.\n\nOur aim is therefore to use expertise in simulation, education, performance art, jazz, multimodal semiotics and engineering design as a framework for illuminating the sociocultural practices of surgery, in the process allowing participants to deepen their understanding of their own domains by reconfiguring their professional practice through new insights. So far as we are aware, the potential of immersive surgical simulation for artistic expression has not been systematically explored.\n\nThis project will allow a group of innovative artists, musicians, social scientists and surgeons to explore the creative potential around surgical simulation as an artistic medium. A multidisciplinary collaborative network will generate innovative and unorthodox approaches which, in addition to their own artistic value and interest, may offer important insights into the complex relationships between surgery and our wider society. \n\n3,070 chars\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit various confirmed and potential user groups. The drawing together of active researchers from different disciplines presents an appropriate context for extending the influence of this period of funded research beyond traditional domain limitations.\n\nMedical Humanities Research Communities\n\nWithin medicine the critical feedback, reflexive debate and introduction of new perceptions and methodologies from the fields of visual art, music, design and semiotics, will mandate a re-evaluation of the ethical and social impact of surgical simulation research. While this will explicitly affect the iterative exploration of the field undertaken by the Principal Investigator, the dissemination of the findings to the medical humanities community is likely to have an influential effect on the understanding of the intellectual challenges and advantages of external scrutiny of medical procedures, training and environments. This project is intended to support a non-hierarchical peer-to-peer dialogue between science-based and arts and humanities based researchers. The project seeks to evaluate the potential for interdisciplinary critique to form an integral part of research into the efficacy of surgical training and procedures. As a pilot case-study for this method of enquiry, medical humanities research and teaching professionals are expected to reference the questions and conclusions raised through this exploratory period of activity. The findings and contentions arising from this initial research will be collated to develop a journal abstract and conference paper. \n\nArts and Humanities Research and Practitioner Communities\n\nThe investigation of the potential for surgical simulation environments to be accessed and critically engaged with by researchers and practitioners from visual art, music, design and other fields offers real benefit to members of research communities who might traditionally have found that their engagement with surgical environments restricted or instrumentalised. The opening of simulated contexts for surgical research to extra-disciplinary manipulation, critique and influence without compromising actual patient or practitioner experience offers an unusual insight into the potential for shared concerns to be articulated within the territories of non-verbal communication, social dynamics and behavioural analysis. The co-investigator, invited consultant participants and other guests will have the opportunity to challenge pre-conceptions of clinical environments and to incorporate reflections on this territory within their home disciplines. The diverse professional experience of the named participants offers real advantages in engaging wider communities with the enquiry and conclusions of this period of research, through their established audiences within visual art galleries, performance venues and museums. \n\nPatients and Practitioners\n\nThis award continues the exploration of the benefits of a multi-disciplinary approach to enhancing the healing environment, actively supported by the Kings Fund and within NHS Trusts since 1993. This proposed period of investigation focusses on the intellectual insights gained in the understanding of external perception of the restricted environment of the operating theatre, the reflections and questions raised during this period of dialogue are intended to encourage an enhanced critical framework to explore empathetical and environmental challenges to an empowered understanding of surgery by those directly involved, whether as practitioners or patients.

This Research Networking Award within the AHRC Science in Culture strand set out to explore how the closed world of the operating theatre - represented through realistic participative simulation - might act as a prompt to artistic response, provoking new conversations and giving rise to insights for all concerned. By allowing a range of experts to engage in prolonged, intense yet unconstrained dialogues and experimentation, the project proved to be highly successful, opening up rich seams of discussion and triggering new lines of enquiry based on unexplored connection. Further work is now required to take advantage of these opportunities.

ACTIVITY
Over the course of the project, our core group (surgeon - Professor Kneebone, artist - David Cotterrell, semiotician - Professor Kress, jazz pianist - Liam Noble, computer scientist - Cian Plumbe and design engineer - Matt Harrison) has come together in different settings and capacities around the theme of surgery. A progressive series of discussions has highlighted the boundary-crossing nature of each of these domains of expertise, and the value of mapping new territories of engagement.

At the outset of the project we set out to gain insights into one another's professional worlds. Key events were followed by a closed session where the themes, ideas and areas of convergence raised by the event were critically evaluated. 

 In addition to discussions within and beyond our core group, we explored the affordances of new visualisation and haptic technologies. For example, 360 degree video capture allowed us to capture multiple perspectives on both open surgery and interventional cardiology.

The project continues to reverberate in the practice of all the participants. For example, we have explored the concept of parallel perspectives by inviting experts from disparate disciplines to form a growing network.

NEXT STEPS 
Because surgery is an alien world to many people, yet at the same time a world that concerns and affects us all, this apparently incongruous conjunction with the worlds of art, music, semiotics and design has proved highly creative and fruitful. 

Direct parallels within other aspects of society relating to power hierarchies and empathetic challenges within formalised relationships have been identified. These conceptual challenges which derive from, but transcend, the specific context of surgery have been identified as key areas of collaborative engagement and potential areas of future collaborative research. 

Building on the success of the Networking Award, our next step is to explore opportunities for further funding to take our findings to the next level. We are exploring opportunities within the AHRC's current and projected funding programme.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Because surgery is an alien world to many people, yet at the same time a world that concerns and affects us all, this apparently incongruous conjunction with the worlds of art, music, semiotics and design has proved highly creative and fruitful.
