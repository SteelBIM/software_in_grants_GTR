Such scandals also raise questions over the extent to which lawyers are or have been involved in corporate wrongdoing and how or if those lawyers can shape and control corporate actors.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This three year project seeks to answer those questions and has two, key overarching objectives:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to generate a body of socio-legal scholarship on the ability of corporate lawyers to influence corporate decision making, and on how the regulator, the Solicitors Regulation Authority (?SRA?), manages risks from large law firms&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to inform policy and practice in the ways lawyers advise their clients and in the way the SRA manages risks.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following reviews of relevant literatures, data for this project will be gathered through three formats:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>semi-structured interviews with corporate lawyers in large firms and with in-house lawyers working for large corporates&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>focus groups with corporate lawyers in large firms&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a period of participant observation and semi-structured interviews with members of the ?Supervision? team at the SRA.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

(a) Group 1 - the regulators of the legal profession in England &amp;amp; Wales (the SRA and the Legal Services Board) and the government (via the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills) need to be able to understand: (a) how lawyers in large law firms and in-house lawyers advise their clients; and (b) what are the risks from that advice. 

(b) Group 2 - legal professionals themselves (lawyers in large law firms and in-house lawyers) need to be reflective and critical of their own work practices and of the potential for harm arising from those practices; 

(c) Group 3 - corporate wrongdoing has the potential to significantly and detrimentally impact on the everyday lives of the general public. The role of lawyers is often forgotten in public debates on corporate wrongdoing. 



HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

(a) Group 1 - the monograph will benefit Group 1 by presenting a study, based in rigorous empirical research, of how lawyers perceive their role and function and what the risks are from that role. This group will also benefit from the 2 day symposium in Year 3 of the project, which will offer them a space in which to interact with other stakeholders (in particular, academics and legal professionals). Promoting a shared and better understanding of the nature of the complex issues linked to legal advice in the corporate sector will enhance the likelihood that the various stakeholders involved will be able to work together to achieve better regulation (soft and hard) in the future.

(b) Group 2 - research generated by this project will lead to practice advice for legal professionals. I will produce a briefing paper on professional obligations - 'Key Conduct Considerations for Corporate Lawyers' - which will advise on good practice. This group will also benefit from my development of a training workshop for lawyers that will introduce them to potential 'pressure points' in advising corporate clients through real world vignettes. This group will also benefit from the reflective space generated by the interviews and focus groups, in which they can take the time to think about exactly what it is that they do, the impacts of what they do and how their conduct and behaviour could and should be modified.

(c) Group 3 - the public lecture in Year 3 of the project and the media articles written during the lifetime of the project will benefit this group by: (a) bringing into the public domain the potential significance of corporate lawyers as vehicles for negatively impacting on everyday lives; and (b) starting a public dialogue on the proper role and function of corporate lawyers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>235157</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Stanford University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Stanford Law School</gtr:department><gtr:description>Fellowship at Stanford University Law School</gtr:description><gtr:id>D4499473-03A9-4830-AEFC-DC9189E69D11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No concrete outputs as yet.

Over two days, we explored various aspects of large law firm practice: the relationships between corporate lawyers and their clients; lawyer independence and the rule of law; legal professional privilege; law firms, businesses and human rights; legal risk; the changing role of General Counsel; bribery and corruption; lawyers' duties etc. Paul Philip (Chief Executive, Solicitors Regulation Authority) opened the conference. Our keynote address was by Richard Moorhead, Professor of Law and Ethics at University College London. The papers, speakers and delegates intentionally reflected a broach church: academics, students, private practice solicitors, in-house lawyers, law firm General Counsel, regulators, consultants and members of the public. The more than 100 delegates and 35 speakers also represented a broad geographic range, drawing on experiences of corporate lawyers and corporate clients in the UK, the wider EU, the US, Australia and Indonesia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://limitsoflawyers.wordpress.com/symposium/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Lawyer Ethics Article</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7020DA44-E929-4058-AC0E-D0C214E34F8E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article for trade publication The Lawyer on the gender differences coming out of my ESRC research into the ethics of corporate lawyers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thelawyer.com/are-female-lawyers-more-ethical-than-the-male/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Leeds Public Lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E74A822-63E2-45D7-A914-9D56C2F112B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In February 2016, I gave a public lecture on the ethics of corporate lawyers at Leeds Law School.

(1) In England and Wales, it has part prompted and contoured the review of the Solicitors Regulation Authority Handbook which regulates the conduct of 130,000 practising solicitors and 10,000 law firms. Here, my research was drawn on by SRA for its Handbook consultation, 'Looking to the Future' (June 2016), and the work led to a 'Lack of Independence' being made a 'Priority Risk' by the Solicitors Regulation Authority (end of 2015);

(2) In Canada, it has shaped the review by the Law Society of Upper Canada on the introduction of 'entity based regulation'. Here, my submissions to LSUC was specifically referenced in its consultation response (May 2016); and

(3) It led to the creation of a free, 3 week Massive Open Online Course on corporate lawyers' ethics (which ran from 7 November 2016 on the FutureLearn Platform and had 4,380 learners from across the globe). 

The results from the project haves been reported in The Times, The Financial Times, City AM, The Lawyer, Legal Futures, the Solicitor's Journal, the Law Society Gazette, Legal Business, Managing Partner magazine, Legal Cheek, Lawyer Watch, Lawyers Weekly, Legal Business, the Global Legal Post, and Attic. Aside from the usual academic conference talks, I have given public lectures on this research (at the University of Leeds, and at UCL in London), the keynote at the Legal Ethics Forum of the Canadian Bar Association, and have been invited to speak at various global law firms on my data and findings. Because of my expertise, I have been appointed to Policy Committee of the Solicitors Regulation Authority (January 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>492E4BEB-8EFA-4895-B02B-CBDE44CDDD1E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project is the largest empirical study of corporate finance lawyers in English law firms to date, and was primarily concerned with the relationships between those lawyers and their elite clients. The project had four key findings:

(1) There has been a significant shift over the last three decades in the balance of power between large law firms and their clients (in favour of clients). This has been for various reasons: (a) the move in-house of a large number of solicitors who are better able to source, price and scope the legal work that clients need; (b) increased competition between law firms due to law firm mergers and globalisation, and the knock on impacts of the financial crisis; and (c) 'new' models of lawyering in which legal work is packaged into discrete parts (or 'unbundled') and allocated to different lawyers/law firms/legal services providers. 

(2) This shift in the balance of power has led a number of a corporate finance lawyers in large law firms to perceive themselves as being 'mere' service providers. The professional identity of these lawyers has consequently been shaped by the shift in the balance of power. Many (junior) corporate finance lawyers see themselves as 'conduits' for what their clients want to effect, rather than as trusted advisors with professional obligations.

(3) There is an ethical apathy held by a large number of corporate finance lawyers. These lawyers did not possess a de minimis form of ethics, nor were they unable to rationalise problems from different ethical viewpoints; rather, that they were largely unenthusiastic, disinterested and unconcerned about the ethics of what they and their clients were doing.

(4) There is an obvious disconnect between how the SRA, as regulator, views the principles on which corporate solicitors act (i.e. the SRA has a flowering in its Handbook of multiple concerns, with the 'public interest' as the top trump) and how corporate solicitors in practice view their roles (i.e. an almost exclusively client-centred, client-first approach). This project shows that we have corporate finance lawyers who are apathetic about the ethical issues posed by their own practices and by their own clients (save for very selective, highly personalised exceptions), and that law firms are not routinely engaging in training and dialogues on the ethics of lawyering in large firms. There is then a risk that those who advise the world's most powerful organisations are blind to the potential for ethical failures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This work can be put to use by academics (interested in legal ethics, lawyers, professionalism, 'client capture', professional service firms, globalisation, and professional services regulation), by policy makers (by identifying areas of mismatch between regulation and practice that require policy responses), and by law firms and lawyers (by providing an evidence base of how their solicitors think about their clients and their work). The work has led to a free Massive Open Online Course, aimed at the public, on corporate lawyers' ethics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>32795AE5-84FA-4A57-883D-BC38CBA3C29D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>LSB RSG Membership</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5739FE05-7BD6-41F4-8C37-758E339B5F39</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://research.legalservicesboard.org.uk/about-lsb-research/research-strategy-group/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of Legal Risk Work in SRA Risk Outlook</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>213C947A-27E7-4A64-8FBC-9B89E0CF8E2F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sra.org.uk/risk/outlook/risk-outlook-2015-2016.page</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SRA Policy Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>613959D1-F918-4F04-B571-3BE02794B204</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sra.org.uk/sra/how-we-work/board/committees.page</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in LSUC May 2016 Regulation Report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6718C972-287A-4D07-8D37-C405D1B1FFDD</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.lsuc.on.ca/uploadedFiles/For_the_Public/About_the_Law_Society/Convocation_Decisions/2016/convocation_may_2016_cber.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation of Independence Work in SRA Risk Outlook</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>87B71455-9AB1-447D-91FE-0B4D073FAD9E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sra.org.uk/risk/outlook/priority-risks/independence.page</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A2FF9394-3FBD-4739-8B14-BC3639F55791"><gtr:id>A2FF9394-3FBD-4739-8B14-BC3639F55791</gtr:id><gtr:title>Corporate lawyers and corporate clients</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Legal Ethics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/986ed0b4f03a4d505348b2b881d0bb81"><gtr:id>986ed0b4f03a4d505348b2b881d0bb81</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vaughan S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4EBE6C0B-7487-46F7-AC48-2BA5672E645C"><gtr:id>4EBE6C0B-7487-46F7-AC48-2BA5672E645C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Futures of Legal Education and the Legal Profession</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/75d4f184ddbf850ecc7761ec30a1dfcd"><gtr:id>75d4f184ddbf850ecc7761ec30a1dfcd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sommerlad S;
