Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L007509/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>There is great potential for understanding more about our society by making better use of data that already exists and by linking different datasets together. This could be undertaken more widely in the UK as in other parts of Europe such as Scandinavia. Using existing data is not only efficient and cheaper than collecting new data, but it can also provide a powerful means of better understanding how society works and what action is needed to tackle a wide range of social issues, thereby guiding the development, implementation and evaluation of policy. This can be achieved in a way that ensures that the public have the maximum confidence that their data are being used appropriately and that the safeguards of these data meet the highest international standards.

To this end, four Administrative Data Research Centres- ARDC for coordinating and undertaking record linkage are being setup in each of the four countries of the UK. In Northern Ireland the two universities and NISRA, the local governmental statistics agency, will come together to promote and facilitate record linkage here. This will have two aspects; an independent body (trusted third party) for linking different datasets and a separate secure environment (the NI-ADRC) for undertaking analyses of the data. The process of record linkage ensures that (i) the trusted third party never see the administrative information about individuals and (ii) that the ADRC never have sight of personal information such as names or addresses. All of these processes will be overseen by a UK Governing Board who report to Parliament, probably via the UK Statistics Authority. The public will be represented at all levels. An Administrative Data Service will coordinate ADRCs activities and provide a single source of information for enquiries and information. 

The NI-ADRC will be led by an academic Director; NISRA will provide the secure environment and oversee its operation with full auditing of all data access and processing. They will also operate the trusted third party linkage. The NI-ADRC will employ two experienced academics to provide assistance and technical support to users of these data who will have undergone accreditation training and access the anonymous data only in a secure environment; all statistical and written outputs will be further scrutinised before release. 

A major task for the NI- ADRCT will be to increase the public awareness of and confidence in the safe linking of administrative records and will therefore appoint a senior Public Engagement and Communications Officer. The NI- ADRC will also raise the potential for and benefits of record linkage amongst the academic fraternity, data custodians and Government Agencies. The formation of NI-ADRC should bring about a closer working relationship between the generators and custodians of administrative data in governmental and other agencies, the potential users of these data, and the policy makers who should benefit from the analyses of these linked data; this interrelationship will be underpinned by a series of seminars and meetings and other opportunities for interaction and exchange.

Early in the first year the ADRC will start to cement relationships with the various data custodians and governmental agencies and (i) catalogue what data is currently available for linkage (ii) negotiate, with the ADS, the production of the metadata and the informal advice and support that will be essential for understanding the processes behind the data and of the database structures, and (iii) over a longer period increase the range and number of datasets available for linkage within NI and the wider UK context, and to encourage the passage of enabling legislation. Building relationships and joint strategies with the other ADRCs and the ADS, and with UK groups with interests in similar datasets and/or methodological approaches will be a major priority from the outset.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Academic and policy researchers throughout the UK will benefit from the greater access to novel high quality data. Given the currently available data, researchers with an interest in social policy, health, education and economics will be amongst the first to benefit with finance, computing and law following as new data and linkage possibilities become available. Those involved with the public sector, especially given the regional structure of government, will find these data linkages invaluable for informing social policy and the ADRC will drive a closer collaboration between world of academia and those involved with policy. One goal of this proposal is to broaden the current base of this activity. A group that could make ready use of the current data to great effect, in terms of driving policy change, is the third sector. Many voluntary organisations, charities, NGOs and community organisations are likely to find much relevant information even in the currently available data. These are groups that will be encouraged, most notably by the appointment of a Public Engagement &amp;amp; Communications Officer, and through a range of public seminars, to think about how the current data could be used to assist them when addressing issues where policy interventions are being sought. Organisations within communities may well find the linkage of data to, for example, the Northern Ireland Neighbourhood Information Service (NINIS) data, a useful source of evidence when addressing issue of social and health inequality.
All of the above mentioned groups are expected to benefit from the ready availability of linked data, and through contact with those who know how the data can be used to address issues that these interest groups see as fundamental to their reason for existence. On a wider front the enactment of legislation benefits from an open and informed debate, and many of these mentioned groups and organisations are well positioned to add to the debate. As more data becomes available, and linked, it is likely that many more individuals and groups will see the advantages to which the data can be put in addressing issues relating to the environment, commerce, health and well-being to name but a few. Information, as the saying goes is power, and the ability for different groups to access evidence, based on data, is likely to, at a minimum, raise the level of debate. In some sense all of the above mentioned groups are likely from time to time to wish to address issues relating to the economic and social impact of particular social policies or interventions. How will welfare reform affect local communities, and what will be the likely impact on social, cultural and business interests? Energy, for example, is a vital commodity, and changes in its pricing structure can have major consequences in terms of social welfare. To address these and other goals, policy briefings, the lobbying of policy makers, and engagement with those interested in driving policy will be undertaken. Many of these potential changes can be modelled, provided the data is available. Information before the enactment of social policy is invaluable to those involved with the policy process and to indeed to those affected by such changes. It is the current groups that are outside these debates that have the most to gain. The data can inform the debate and better choices may be possible as a consequence where Public Policy and Legislation can be informed by 'facts' generated on the basis of data. Of course, ideological choices have still to be made by those in power, but these choices can be made with the best available evidence of their consequences. Further, innovation and technical change essential to maintaining a competitive edge can be better managed, through effective human resource planning and in common with all change it requires that we are in a position to know and analyse what is currently in place and what steps are required to ensure that future needs can be met.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6268151</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ulster</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Seeing the Whole Picture: A Holistic Analysis of the Profile of Pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN) in Northern Ireland.</gtr:description><gtr:id>441C12C1-3DDA-40A8-AD6B-0FFE9B347ABE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project has now been approved by the Administrative Data Research Network and we are currently waiting on Department of Education Solicitors to give the go ahead for release of DE data.

The presentations on the research and its implication for policy, particularly around the use of data for research, sparked questions and discussion from an audience that included third sector organisations, graduate students, and local government (councils) representatives.

There was extensive discussion of the type of data necessary to establish outcomes from the current Children's Strategy and to monitor progress towards newly specified outcomes following commencement of a new strategy.

Focus groups discussed what measures could be sought to monitor the progress of the Children's Strategy. Based on reviews of best evidence across the UK, I suggested that schools might collate indicators of parental engagement in children's education (e.g. via attendance of parents' evenings, Parent-Teacher Meetings, etc.) Children's own attendance of school was also noted as a key early indicator.

I outlined the progress to date of the ADRC-NI in availing of secondary departmental data sources, safe individual-level linkage and the plans to extend this to the study of education and early years. This led to the conclusion that there could be more thorough monitoring of the new Children's Strategy via the new data linkage infrastructure than of the current strategy. In particular the degree to which all social groups benefit equally from education policy interventions (or to which previously marginalised groups benefit) can be better monitored using rich linked data.

Focus group notes were collated and presented to representatives of the Office for First Minister and Deputy First Minister.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ci-ni.org.uk/DatabaseDocs/nav_9124869__co-design_on_the_childrens_strategy.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ADRC-NI engagement activity with senior members of the School of Management and Economics</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C18B6F23-F1BB-44BE-8D07-7E841078032E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an outreach meeting to senior members within the School of Management and Economics at QUB: these were senior researchers who had previously demonstrated interest in using Social Security Benefits data; the aim was to stimulate interest in the widening access to Benefits Data locally.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited presentation in Copenhagen (AK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF7E5C70-2164-4F6D-A650-52B9285253F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Anne Kouvonen: &amp;quot;Physical activity and mental health in older, midlife and younger women&amp;quot;.
