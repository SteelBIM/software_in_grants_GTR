It will develop, test and refine tools for evaluating adaptation measures designed to enhance the resilience of the network including societal and technical adaptation. The work will consist of 5 work packages (WPs).WP1 will produce future climate scenarios for three key weather variables where changes in average characteristics can impact on the operational resilience of the network and changes in extremes can impact the infrastructural resilience of the network: temperature (and solar radiation), rainfall (with associated flooding) and wind. WP2 will develop electricity demand and supply scenarios, consistent both with the climate change impacts scenarios from WP1, and levels of decarbonisation required to meet policy targets. WP3 will couple the hazard model from WP1 with demand and supply scenarios from WP2 with a dynamic, spatially explicit, power systems simulation model. WP4 will use the model to quantify the potential impacts of future climate upon the day to day (operational) resilience and resilience to extreme events (infrastructure network resilience) of the overall GB electricity transmission system (i.e. the National Grid), and case study distribution networks. Against these infrastructure, demand and climate futures we will test the effectiveness of a wide range of adaptation options for improving the overall resilience of the energy system. Adaptation is not seen here as a purely technical activity but should consider societal adaptation where by consumers change their practices to cope with changing levels of network reliability. WP5 will assess the impact of the future vulnerability of the network upon organisations and households, taking into account climate change impacts, and consider how these may adapt.Contemporary UK society has grown accustomed to a reliable supply of electricity with any interruption to supply typically considered, socially, politically and economically undesirable, almost regardless of the technical and economic implications of maintaining such high levels of integrity. This expected level of service places further constraints on an electricity network already facing multiple challenges. Ultimately, if the UK's energy system is to achieve the urgent and rapid mitigation implied by the Government's 2 deg C commitment, the electricity system will have to undergo profound changes over the short, medium and long term. Pivotal to a successful and rapidly decarbonising electricity system is a transmission and distribution network that is resilient to climate change impacts, capable of balancing different types of low carbon supply in the context of a changing demand profile. Early and integrated analysis of these systemic challenges will pay significant dividends in developing an affordable, robust and low carbon electricity system resilient to the direct and indirect impacts of changing environmental and socio-economic drivers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The RESNET project has been designed to explore issues of adaptation to climate change impacts and resilience in Britain's electricity networks under different climate change scenarios. Providing methods that help secure the security and resilience of the electricity network will provide a wide public benefit. Enhancing the future resilience of GB's electricity transmission network is a central part of the country's adaptation response to climate change. A reliable electricity supply underpins GB's economic and social well being, from the provision of basic heating and lighting to powering transport systems, manufacturing capability and the delivery of essential services such as health, safety and security. One of the core objectives of the research programme is to identify adaptation measures to existing infrastructure and to provide advice on enhancing the resilience of future network architecture. This benefits the economy in two ways, firstly through the potential for technology transfer of adaptation technologies to both the domestic and international markets and secondly by supporting the productivity of the GB economy by the provision of a reliable and predictable electricity supply. The project has been designed in collaboration with research beneficiaries including UKCIP, the National Grid, Arup, the Environment Agency and the Committee on Climate Change Secretariat. We will be seeking input from these, and other organisations, to ensure we maximise our impact and have allocated 4k to support this activity. The direct beneficiaries of this part of the research will be the National Grid, supply and generation companies, in terms of the technical knowledge transfer. Policy makers will benefit as the methods developed here will be informative to Defra's national climate change risk assessment. Moreover, through a PhD sponsored by the National Grid we shall have a direct route to impact their capacity to analyse electricity resilience. Co-Is Dawson and Kilsby are members of the British Energy Climate Change Working Group providing an avenue for the direct transfer of knowledge generated in RESNET. Outputs from WP2 include new spatially correlated national scale weather generator and a UKCP09 consistent wind storm model to be returned to the wide range of UKCP09 users. The behavioural responses to future adaptation measures can inform how organisations change their electricity usage practices in response to climate change. Core users such as the NHS, network rail and emergency services will be engaged through WP5, co-producing knowledge to inform recommendations on institutional responses. In addition to involving end-users in the research itself, the project will maintain a website detailing the objectives and outputs of the project; publish a report based on the findings of each work package for wide dissemination and organise public lectures (with podcasts) and conduct dissemination seminars during the research program. We shall maximise impact through mobilising the Tyndall Centre stakeholder network to disseminate outcomes to a wide array of scientists, policy makers and practitioners. We will explore commercial opportunities with our universities and consultancy partners (e.g. Arup). WP4 for example produces a probabilistic power system security assessment tool, this tool will not only provide methods to evaluate the resilience of electricity systems that will be of interest to many countries but will also be able to be used by the insurance industry to gauge the risk to their future portfolios with minimal extension. Given the new understanding and tools that the RESNET project will provide, these organisations will be in an unprecedented position to understand processes of long term change, adaptation and resilience of electricity networks. Many UK utility owners and consultancies have major international businesses, so the work has the potential to contribute to their competitiveness overseas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>977839</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder meeting with National Grid - 15th April 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63D1116C-BD81-43B7-AACE-F629644E022C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Agree on the changes and the time scales of the final report on the impact of climate change on ratings.

Proposals call for investment in transport, science and innovation, plus devolution of civic powers. This event asked the question: what if energy policy was also devolved - how would we develop a strategy that could power the Northern Powerhouse? A range of proposals made by a University think-tank, involving both academics and students, was revealed at The University of Manchester Policy Week event then debated live by our powerhouse panel of experts, drawn from the worlds of politics and economics, policy and strategy, science and energy-related research. From this analysis delegates will vote for their preferred option. Jaise Kuriakose - PhD researcher on the RESNET project presented one of the options and his scenario was chosen as the winning option. The scenario was large scale renewable with smart grids using storage and demand side management.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=24891</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ARCC Stakeholder meeting, Edinburgh, 5th July 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30BDD521-D7B1-4773-B7FF-5FFC87BB30DA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Liaising with other ARCC funded projects to discuss overlaps and gaps in research.

From increased carrying capacity fed by more intermittent and low-carbon supply, through to major shifts in diurnal and seasonal demands. Whatever the short-term vagaries of particular governments, there is a strong current pushing the electricity network to not only become low carbon, but for it to extend to sectors previously supplied by alternative energy carriers. The tentative moves toward electric cars and the electrification of wider public transport, through to a shift from gas to some form of electrical heating, all have serious implications for operating the grid. But just as importantly, the grid faces new demands from air conditioning loads through to the potential cold ironing of ships (i.e. having them connect to the grid whilst in port) and the increasing electrification of industry as it seeks to become low carbon 

Not only is the proportion of final energy demand met by electricity set to increase significantly beyond its current 20% level, but the physical grid infrastructure also faces escalating climate impacts. However, given the geographical position of the UK and the considerable uncertainty in what levels of mitigation the global community will deliver, it is not possible to provide a detailed specification and timeline of national climate change impacts.
In terms of threats to the electricity network due to changes in extreme wind speed, as it stands, there is too much uncertainty in climate models as to making statistically robust assessments of increased frequency or severity of extreme events. 

Electricity demand in a lower-carbon future The low carbon agenda is already having early impacts on the grid and these are clearly set to increase. The UK's current mitigation proposals certainly fall far short of those associated with the country making its fair contribution to keeping temperatures below the international community's 2&amp;deg;C target. Nevertheless, even under the UK's very conservative framing of mitigation, this research demonstrates significant changes to the existing portfolio of loads on the grid and the diurnal variations in demand. Moreover, there is set to be a substantial increase in the total annual demand placed on grid - a challenge both to the network and the generators.
Key outputs:
1) In the absence of a major retrofit of the existing housing stock (in relation climate resilience as well as mitigation), there is a risk that the air conditioning load of the domestic and commercial sectors on the grid may become a major source of summer load. 
2) There is a significant prospect that heating and car transport may become increasingly electrified. These would place addition loads on the grid, with the former potentially compensated, at least in part, by warmer winter temperatures.
3) The scenarios developed here, though not commensurate with the 2&amp;deg;C framing of climate change, nevertheless suggest significant increases in both annual electricity consumption and important changes in demand profiles. Both of these have major implications for the electricity network.
 
Transmission system capacity in a changing climate key outputs
1) Unchanged, overhead lines will be subject to levels of de-rating that could impose important constraints on the carrying capacity of the grid during periods of high demand. However, the switch to conductors more resilient to higher temperatures offers a relatively simple technical solution to the issue.
2) Underground cables and transformers will also require de-rating, with the technical responses both more challenging and potentially more costly than that available to overhead lines.
3) Although it became clear that the components being assessed are resilient to a wide range of impacts, the de-rating accompanying increased climate change is nonetheless far from trivial. Combined with considerable increases in demand, there is significant need for the grid to be reinforced to cope with the future demands very likely to be placed on it.

Power systems resilience to changing weather Key finding:
1) a new approach for providing a comprehensive resilience assessment of the network was developed and is applicable to any power system where appropriate information is available. It provides an operator with an ability to evaluate alternative adaption approaches, and hence deliver power systems with requisite levels of resilience to specified extreme events.

Network evolution in a lower carbon future Key findings:
1) The evolution of most networks is driven principally by a small suite of fundamental parameters - put simply demand, efficiency and cost. Their impact on the network can be understood by applying different probability distributions to each key factor.
2) If the network does develop along the lines outlined in 1), its vulnerability to extreme winds will be greater than it is today, and this will be further exacerbated by the increase in wind conditions with higher levels of climate change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings can be used to help assess how the grid may be reinforced and/or managed to cope with new pressures
