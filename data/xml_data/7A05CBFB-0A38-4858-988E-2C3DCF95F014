This project proposes the novel concept for on-chip architecting of the dynamically reconfigurable systems on Si chip for many advanced optoelectronics device applications. This will be achieved using novel reconfigurable nanocomposites, based on nematic liquid crystals doped with graphene. For the first time, we propose the optofluidic technology for the infiltration of developed in this project nanocomposites into Si photonic platform and for their direct low-power controllable self-assembling into defined micro-structures and micro-devices. The approach to realize this ambitiouse aim in 24 motnhs of this project is (A) to develop novel nanocomosite material platform for integration on Si chip; (B) to demosntrate the first electrically/themrally driven reconfigurable device integrated into micro-photonic circuit on Si chip, i.e. an active metamaterial structure with an ability to filter, split, and switch polarized light in the plane of chip.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed practicable approach for effective on-chip engineering of the integrated hybrid micro-system devices and circuits may revolutionize micro-electronic and micro-photonic industries by providing inexpensive, high-speed, portable and reliable platform for future applications impacting almost every aspect of life, from energy saving systems and high-speed internet to small consumer devices. Therefore, this research project will have significant impact on the economy, as well as on the society, as consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries of such advanced technologies. 
Development of CMOS-compatible graphene photonic devices is of industrial and scientific importance, and has the potential to impact several vast and growing markets, specifically Global Optoelectronics market and Si photonics market. According to the Optoelectronic Industry Development Association, the market for optoelectronic components and the technologies enabled by them will more than double from 2007 reaching a $1.2 trillion market by 2017. Due to rapid development of optoelectronics, it is expected that adoption of this technology in communication, medicine, and material science will rise in the years to come, and due to the increasing demand, the photonics market segment is expected to generate revenue of $410.78 million by year 2020. The trend of miniaturization of optoelectronic devices with increasing requirement for speed and efficiency as well as keeping the cost economical, has resulted in the increase in demand for the global silicon photonics market. The Si photonics market becoming an interesting avenue globally as it has the advantage of requiring low power consumption, having higher density of interconnects, higher integration and reliability. The global Si photonics market is anticipated to grow with two digit compound annual growth rate. According to the recent market research report &amp;quot;Silicon Phonics Market by Product, by Application, and by Geography - Global Trends and Forecasts to 2014 - 2020&amp;quot;, the Si photonics market is expected to grow to $497.53 million by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 27.74% from 2014 to 2020. 
The outputs of the proposed project, the development of the first practicable model and engineering tool for design of dynamically reconfigurable photonic systems on Si chip, will be fundamental to the development of the next generation CMOS-photonics. This short 24 months project presents a vision for the smart model of novel device platform for realization of future custom-designed multi-functional systems and will impact two currently growing EPSRC priority areas: Photonic materials and Metamaterials, and Microsystems, and at least eight areas of strategic importance: Graphene and Carbon Nanotechnology, Biophysics and Soft Matter Physics, Plasmonics, Light Matter Interaction and Optical Phenomena, Optical Devices and Subsystems, Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits, Particle Technology, and Non CMOS Device Technology. The proposed project will secure a leading role of UK in these research areas. 
Thus, the pathways to impact can be summarized as:
- Development of new practicable technology and test prototype devices in collaboration with an UK-based industrial partner Oclaro Ltd., which could lead to commercial exploitation of the technology developed in this project.
-Publications in high quality journals of international readership, and presentation of results in prestigious international conferences;
-Training a Postdoctoral associate and two PhDs in the emerging field of high value - CMOS photonics; 
-Maximize public awareness of the societal benefits of the research via project web-site and social media;
-Promoting and supporting women in STEMM disciplines, through Athena SWAN Charter and public outreach events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101062</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>An innovative, cutting-edge technology, that can be used to produce a 3-D microchip more easily and cheaper than conventional methods for faster, future computing has been developed. The work provides a solid platform for the development of novel next-generation optoelectronic devices. Additionally, the materials and&amp;nbsp;methods&amp;nbsp;developed are extremely promising for a wide&amp;nbsp;range&amp;nbsp;of further potential&amp;nbsp;applications&amp;nbsp;beyond the current electronic devices.

An international team of scientists, lead by Dr Anna Baldycheva from the University of Exeter, have pioneered a new technique for integration of 2D materials (atomically thin materials) on electronic chip using microfluidic technology. An ultra-high signal sensitivity to the xyz alignment of 2D material nano flakes within the microfluidic device circuit was experimentally demonstrated. This in turn enables precise in-situ alignment detection, for the first practicable realisation of 3D photonic microstructure shaping based on 2D material-fluid composites and the integrated electronic-photonic platform.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The discovery could revolutionise the production of optoelectronic materials - i.e. devices that produce, detect and control light - which are vital to the next generation of renewable energy, security and defence technologies.&amp;nbsp;For example, controlled deposition of 2D materials using the developed monitoring technique has applications in producing large area energy-gathering structures (e.g. solar panels). The microfluidic systems presented and the integration of 2D materials has applications in a variety of sensing applications.
