When we lose our memory, we do not just miss appointments. Autobiographical memory (memory for personal events) is vital for supporting a sense of identity. Thus memory impairments can lead to more than mere forgetfulness; they can affect our sense of self and identity.&lt;br />&lt;br />This research project aims to examine the relationship between memory and identity across the lifespan. It will explore what changes take place in ageing and have implications for the understanding of dementia. The central methodological tools used will focus on collecting autobiographical memories that are particularly relevant to the self and exploring the features of these memories. Ethical approval will be obtained prior to commencement of data collection.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will benefit four key stakeholders: (a) older adults with dementia, (b) clinicians/public sector, (c) the general public and (d) academics in the field of autobiographical memory. The ways in which this research will benefit each group are outlined below:

(a) Older adults with dementia
This research will benefit older adults with dementia by increasing the effectiveness of public services and therapeutic interventions for this group. The knowledge transfer necessary for these impacts will stem from strong links with Prof Holmes' large, locally-based NIHR grant on improving cognitive resilience in dementia (see letter of support for details). The proposed projects will uncover the mechanisms through which autobiographical retrieval supports health and well-being, and thus the long-term benefits of this research will be to enhance quality of life for older adults with dementia.

(b) Clinicians/public sector
Dementia is a growing burden on the NHS, and there is a need to develop cost-effective strategies for maintaining well-being in dementia. Reminiscing about the past is already recognised as an important part of Cognitive Stimulation Therapy, a highly cost-effective and NICE-recommended treatment that improves quality of life in dementia (Spector et al., 2003). However, less is understood about the mechanisms through which autobiographical retrieval might be used to support the self and improve well-being in dementia. This programme of research will directly address this issue. There will be long-term benefits for clinicians and the public sector (NHS) as results will inform the design of future psychotherapeutic interventions. Stakeholders will be engaged through established links with Prof Holmes (who, as a clinical psychologist and NIHR grant-holder, is involved with many clinical and NHS networks in the local Oxfordshire area). A planned programme of knowledge exchange activities throughout the grant lifecycle (see Pathways to Impact for details) will ensure that results are communicated to this group. This will enable potential long-term impacts on public policy and services to be achieved.

(c) The general public
The general public are an important beneficiary of this research. In the short-term, this research will engage the general public (through a series of planned events, both local and national) with the latest research on memory changes in ageing and dementia. Media engagement and the project website will also raise public access to research findings and implications. In the longer-term, this research will benefit the general public by improving the health and well-being of the UK's ageing population by showing how autobiographical retrieval can strengthen identity.

(d) Academics in the field of autobiographical memory
The field of autobiographical memory is relatively insular. This research will bridge the gaps between autobiographical memory, cognitive resilience, and well-being, via synergistic links with an NIHR-funded research programme on cognitive resilience in dementia. The proposed research builds on previous work in the field of self and memory, and will provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind the self-memory relationship - a topic that is relevant to autobiographical memory academics from a variety of backgrounds (e.g. ageing, cognition, identity, and dementia studies). Results will be disseminated to this group via a range of international conferences and high impact publications (detailed in the Case for Support and Pathways to Impact attachments).

Finally, this research will be central to the leadership development of the applicant. Through a series of collaborations (with Prof Holmes, Prof Ellis, and Prof Berntsen) and a programme of training and professional development, the applicant will develop her international research profile and forge lasting networks with important and influential contacts in both academia and the public sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>139300</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Damernas Varld magazine, Sweden</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07B2E395-40CE-434A-AB64-6A843374AA8A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Results of my research were disseminated internationally to the public.

The grant objectives were met and the project was fruitful, generating eight peer-reviewed publications (with a further five under review) and a number of new research partnerships.

The most significant achievements were: 

(1) Identity and well-being: Rathbone et al (2015) found that well-being does not depend on what you remember, or even how good your memory is - what is key is how you conceptualise your sense of self in the present moment. This finding is important, as it suggests that the memory problems associated with ageing do not necessarily impact on well-being.

(2) The self and memory: In Alzheimer's disease, I found that - as in healthy older adults - the self in dementia is supported by a scaffold of factual memories (e.g. knowledge of regular outings with friends, or a period working in a particular job). The implications of this work are that, in cases of memory loss, identity can be supported by a small number of factual memories. These self-supporting memories could be a useful target for reminiscence therapy.

(3) Identity in psychopathology: Two studies showing that self-images (e.g. I am statements) are a powerful way of examining identity in psychopathology. For example, Rathbone and Steel (2014) found that negative self-images (e.g. being a failure, being unloved) were supported by salient autobiographical memories, and associated with increased self-reported depression. This finding suggests that negative self-images may be formed through rehearsal of negative life events - a result of particular relevance to clinical depression. This work was a catalyst for an interdisciplinary collaboration with the MRC Cognitive and Brain Sciences Unit (Cambridge). Di Simplicio, Holmes and Rathbone (2015) tested participants with high and low bipolar symptoms, finding that increased anxiety and depression scores were associated with the presence of negative self-images.

(4) Self-image database: collection of over 2,000 self-images (e.g. I am a sister, I am a friend, I am sociable) which have been collated and coded. These self-image norms will provide an important resource for academics from a range of disciplines. For example, they can be used as experimental primes by cognitive psychologists, or form comparison data for researchers working with clinical groups such as people with depression or Alzheimer's disease. These norms will enable researchers to assess whether a particular group of participants have described their identity in a way that is typical or atypical for their age and gender. 

In addition to these achievements, a number of research networks were established and fostered during this project. These include a multidisciplinary ARHC-funded collaboration on the role that memories of poetry play in supporting well-being, work with members of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the John Radcliffe hospital in Oxford exploring the impact of memory disorders on the self, and collaboration on a Danish PhD project on past and future events and identity. All three research networks have led to peer-reviewed papers that are currently either published or under review. 

Finally, as a result of my work on identity and memory in dementia I was nominated a Young Leader in Dementia Research. As such, I am now an active member of a global multidisciplinary network of 200 young research leaders. This has multiple benefits for dissemination and preparation of future collaborative projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this grant show that identity is shaped by the memories and facts we use to tell our life story, and is closely linked to well-being. This topic has a range of important multidisciplinary applications, from developing our understanding of the link between identity and psychopathology to promoting well-being in ageing. Key findings have been presented to academics and clinicians through seven invited seminars, ten conference presentations and (to date) eight peer-reviewed publications and two book chapters. Results have also been shared with the public at five public engagement events. The feedback and interest generated by these events have highlighted several key ways in which this research might be taken forward by others:

1) By academics: New research programmes based on findings from this grant are being developed through international collaborations with a PhD student (Aarhus University, Denmark) exploring future self-images across the lifespan, and early career researcher (University of Liege, Belgium) examining the self in various forms of dementia. A natural progression of this work will be to develop experimental studies to examine the mechanisms through which self-images are related to well-being. This work will elucidate potential interventions for boosting well-being. Furthermore, the self-image database generated as part of this project constitutes a freely-available resource for academics from a range of disciplines.

2) By communities and healthcare professionals: This work has highlighted the range of identities that are salient to healthy older adults and people with dementia. It suggests that, in cases of memory loss, identity can be supported by a small number of factual memories that provide a scaffold for the self. Cueing and discussing these self-supporting memories could be a useful technique for supporting self and well-being. This approach also provides a new framework for understanding identity in dementia.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94FC6E18-8152-43E1-A32D-FA28D0F8B5F4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities
