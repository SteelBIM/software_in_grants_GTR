Major concerns for long term sustainability are climate change and energy production. At present, energy production and climate change are tightly interrelated since the generation of energy from the burning of fossil fuels emits most of the carbon dioxide (CO2) responsible for the alarming warming of the planet. Decoupling energy production from CO2 emission - in other words, producing energy without emitting CO2 - is a necessary step toward a sustainable society.

A never resting depletion of oil and gas resources threatens the long term sustainability of our society. Today's society relies very heavily on oil and gas exploitation and the large majority of present infrastructures are built for the production, storage, transportation, and consumption of oil and gas carbon-based products. A logical approach to the current climate and energy challenge is to leverage on these infrastructures and use them as assets for the sustainable energy system of the future.

Within this effort, converting CO2 to carbon-based fuels to be used directly in the existing energy infrastructure represents an ideal option to tackle the current global climate and energy challenge. Carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) approaches underpin the future success of this effort combining technical, economical, societal, and political aspects of the same issue. The present work addresses one of the technical aspects of CCU. In particular, new CCU technologies have to be deployed in large scale in order to produce a real impact on the society, and for this to happen better catalytic materials are needed to convert CO2 to fuel more efficiently. 

The present research work is focused on preparing new catalytic materials for the conversion of CO2 to methane (CH4). These materials are designed and prepared from the synergistic combination of the catalytic properties of copper (Cu) - known for its unique ability to facilitate the conversion of CO2 to CH4 - and polymers purposely selected to promote the formation of CH4 using less energy and producing less by-products. The aim of the present research is then to provide new Cu-polymer composite catalysts for the improved conversion of CO2 to CH4. Furthermore, when perennial wind, solar, wave, or tidal energy is used to drive the conversion of CO2, carbon-neutral CH4 is produced. Such a carbon-neutral CH4 can be fed immediately in the current natural gas infrastructure offering a realistic option to the creation of a low-carbon sustainable society.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are many potential users of the results obtained from this research project. Apart from the direct benefit to researchers working in the field, combining carbon sequestration with the use of renewable energy to make sustainable carbon-based fuels can also impact significantly the private sector, policy-makers, and wider public.

Industrial partners and SMEs can take advantage of the research outputs of this project both in terms of a new platform for further research and development of CO2-to-fuel technologies, or as know-how and expertise on which to base future bids for collaborative funding. The PI has access to a privileged group of industrial partners through the ESRI membership programme. These partners include BP, eCORP UK and Oman Oil that have direct interest in developing technologies for alternative fuel sources. Furthermore, the PI has access to SMEs working in the energy sector through the LEAD Wales programme that could be interested in materials developed in the project. In the long term, both approaches can have a direct impact on the economic competitiveness of the UK.

Better catalysts for the conversion of CO2 to fuel can enable the creation of new technologies essential for the construction of a sustainable society. In the long term, politicians can leverage on tangible technological progress in CO2-to-fuel conversion to build momentum and consensus over public expenditure on sustainable fuel sources. At the same time, measurable progress in renewable fuel production can shape future policies and affect societal organization.

The present proposal includes a request for funding for the making of a short film to show how the impact of converting CO2 to fuel can positively change people's quality of life especially in terms of wealth and health. This will allow us to reach for a wider public and to built awareness and consent around research in alternative fuel sources. 

The research staff and students involved in this project will strengthen and widen their knowledge and skills in advanced materials preparation, characterization, and application. They will also be involved in collaborative work acquiring team-working and communication skills. Furthermore, they will learn to blend and merge creative and critical thinking in order to propose and develop novel materials and technological solutions. All of this is essential for the creation of a highly skilled work force necessary to build and maintain the future sustainable society.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99422</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Initiative for Managing Policymaker-Academic Cooperation and Knowledge Transfer (IMPACKT)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B81D3F68-71BF-413D-98EA-B460D265AE04</gtr:id><gtr:impact>IMPACKT is an interdisciplinary project based out of Swansea University that aims to create sustained and proactive dialogue between policymakers and academics working in a variety of fields. It looks to establish an iterative dialogue between government, universities, industry and other partners, drawing on expertise from politics, public policy, medicine and engineering. It wants to explore the types and nature of current collaboration across sectors, barriers and opportunities for further collaboration and institutional and network mechanisms that exist to facilitate collaboration.

To achieve this, we first choose a simple and effective method to prepare large surface area copper micro/nanostructures known in the scientific literature as copper nanofoams. We then modified this method and the resulting copper nanofoams using polymers bearing various functionalities such as carboxylic groups (-COOH), amide groups (-CONH2), and amine groups (-NH2). We showed that depending on the polymer the morphology and crystalline structure of the foams can change. We demonstrated that using our new method amide and amine-bearing polymers graft stably on the copper so that the resulting copper-polymer composite surfaces can be used for carbon dioxide electrolysis. We discovered that grafting an amide polymer can double the efficiency of hydrocarbon production compared to plain copper foams, we produced up to 24% ethylene from carbon dioxide. Instead, amine polymers enhanced hydrogen evolution at the expense of carbon dioxide conversion to hydrocarbons. We did not produce significant amounts of methane so far because of the intrinsic structure of these copper foams, but as stated in the objectives of the project &amp;quot;independently of the product, the valorisation of CO2 has its intrinsic value, above all the creation of a decarbonised economy.&amp;quot; We have already planned a series of experiments to understand the role of the polymers in the catalytic process including in-situ grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) at the European Synchrotron Research Facility to probe for the stability of copper oxide phases and gain an insight into the chemical nature of the catalytic structures that interacts with carbon dioxide during reduction. We also have new ideas to test to further enhance hydrocarbon production while quenching competitive hydrogen evolution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings, in agreement with the research hypothesis of this project, demonstrate that polymers can be used to tailor the product distribution obtained from carbon dioxide conversion on copper. Taken forward, this can open up new ways to produce much-needed hydrocarbons from carbon dioxide using renewable energy in the process. Researchers can extend this approach to other polymers, metals, and structures. The method developed in this work is simple and the proposed preparation of catalytic electrode surfaces is potentially scalable to match larger electrolysers for those who have access to higher current sources.
