The present project provides a novel solution by using insights from those with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, who are known to excessively monitor (eg, &amp;quot;Did I turn the oven off?&amp;quot;), and apply this to those who don?t monitor their finances.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will examine which cognitive factors explain why debtors fail to adequately monitor their debt. Then examine debtors? attentional biases with debt-related stimuli and how this relates to how they monitor their finances. This information will be used to modify how debtors interact with debt-related stimuli, and quantify its influence on financial behaviours. Finally, this will be applied to the design of a Manage Your Debt Application System (MYDAS) mobile phone intervention which aims to improve how debtors monitor their debt.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will have the following implications:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>Science:&lt;/strong> By providing an empirical understanding of the thought process of debtors and an intervention to change those thought processes key to debt.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&lt;strong>Society:&lt;/strong> By providing new tools to identify problem debtors and interventions (MYDAS) the research will benefit debtors (reduce debt), creditors (repayment) and debt agencies.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Debt and reducing personal debt are the focus of significant and sustained attention, both in the UK and internationally. For example, in the last year there was a 48% increase in family household debt suggesting that people are falling further into debt as financial constraints tighten. However, despite this the psychological underpinnings of debt have remained elusive with empirically validated interventions non-existent. In filling this gap my research will benefit the following.

DEBTORS. The end point of this research is to produce an empirically validated intervention called 'Manage Your Debt Application System' (MYDAS) which will be made freely downloadable to the mobile phones of debtors and will be accessible on the project website (see: http://mydasresearch.org.uk/). I will also target these key beneficiaries by challenging the 'debt as taboo' through my project website, improving debt seeking advice and/or repayment and improving mental health outcomes. In addition, my research will bring to the fore that debtors and those who ignore their debt specifically need to be considered as a unique group with their own cognitive profile, needs, demands, and problems. 

DEBT HELP AGENCIES. As I will work in close collaboration with a number of debt help agencies: Citizens Advice (Sheffield and UK wide), Consumer Credit Counselling Service, Debt Advice Foundation, National Debtline, and Debt Support Trust, this research will serve these key beneficiaries by providing an empirically grounded understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying debt and debt avoidance. For example, working alongside my project partner Steve Wilcox (Sheffield Citizens Advice Debt Unit: CAD) with the aim of rolling out MYDAS within Sheffield and the UK - 17 interlinked CAD Units Nationwide - this research will influence debt policy by showing that debtors have specific cognitive profiles requiring specifically tailored interventions. 

CREDITORS. Another set of beneficiaries are creditors companies and organizations, such as, Her Majesty's Court Services, Utility (Electric, Water), Local Authorities and Debt Collection Agencies. These downstream beneficiaries will benefit as MYDAS proposes to increase financial monitoring leading to increased likelihood of seeking debt advice and/or debt repayment. 

SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY. Improving monitoring has traditionally focused on using external tools to induce behaviour change. This research provides the new insight that we can borrow from cases of pathologically monitoring in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and then apply these same mechanisms to debtors. This may help change a view that clinical disorders are not always a negative endpoint per se but rather, in specific instances, can inform a means of positive behaviour change. 

COMPUTING SCIENCE. Computing science as an intervention tool is receiving increased attention. Critically, my research will impact this field by targeting the ESRC strategic aim to 'Influence Behaviour and Inform Intervention.' Wherein, I highlight the mechanisms of different behaviours (i.e., debtors vs. non-debtors) and apply interventions specifically designed to these problematic behaviours (i.e., MYDAS). Advancing knowledge of how mobile phones can positively change behaviour is evidence of the broad impact my work will have. 

SCIENCE MUSEUMS/GALLERIES. With science communicator Simon Watt (from Channel 4s: Inside Natures Giants) we will collaborate to produce an exhibit of my work, with an emphasis on MYDAS, to impact a range of non-scientific beneficiaries. As a result, my project will make central contributions to public knowledge of the psychological underpinnings of debt, the health concerns of debt, and interventions to debt, i.e., MYDAS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>230266</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire Credit Union</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Study into improving financial estimates at Chesterfield ad North East Derbyshire Credit Uniion</gtr:description><gtr:id>AB75D887-039B-495F-85CB-706D2A020C28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data collection was completed for this study in December of 2015. Data analyses has been conducted and has shown that the intervention improved financial decision-making. Specifically, it was found that those who completed the intervention made more accurate income and expenditure estimates compared to those in the control condition. In addition, those who completed the intervention made more accurate estimates of their expenditure on entertainment (e.g., holidays, christmas) compared to those in the control condition who greatly underestimated their expenditure in this domain. 

It is important to note that a range of informative demographic and financial data was gathered. The Credit Union has never gathered such information and as such may be able to use it to guide their policies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>At this point I was working on this project alone.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>After lengthy discussion with Chesterfield and North East Derbyshire Credit Union a study design was agreed upon. It was agreed that the best means of delivering the intervention was to embed it within their present loan application form.

(2) Reduced the paperwork that participants had to carry around and complete.

In conjunction with my recently hired research assistant, we are presently testing participants with a classic approach-avoidance task with the aim of testing if this can improve financial decision making (i.e., less avoidance of financial information).

The abstract for two studies associated with this are:

Many people avoid dealing with their debts to the point that they are burdened with
significant financial, legal and health problems. Across two studies, we show experimentally
that debt-related stimuli prime avoidance and identify cognitive bias modification (CBM)
tasks that can be used to reduce this bias. To measure avoidance biases we used a priming
task where debt-related visual stimuli were briefly presented followed by target words related
to approach and avoidance. Across both experiments, debt avoidance biases were found.
Participants initially made faster responses to the avoidance compared to the approach words
when preceded by debt stimuli. In experiment 1, participants then completed an approachavoidance
task (AAT) in which they were required to repeatedly pull a joystick, which
incidentally made debt stimuli become larger on the screen. In experiment 2, participants
completed an attentional bias modification (ABM) task in which they had to respond to a dot
probe repeatedly presented at a location incongruent with a preceding debt stimulus acting as
a spatial cue. We found that only the AAT reduced avoidance priming by debt stimuli,
although both CBM paradigms reduced negative valence and arousal ratings. Our findings
suggest that debt-related stimuli prime avoidance and that an AAT can reduce this
association. Attentional bias modification may have maintained the avoidance bias due to it
being a form of informational avoidance. We suggest that the next step will be for studies to
establish if the AAT can be usefully applied to reduce debt amongst debtors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>59A418F5-F554-42B7-8A8E-EF2D5214E890</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These studies have recently been submitted to the Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology and Economics.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Approach-Avoidance Study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An intervention study comparing the efficacy of a contemplation questionnaire (vs control) on avoidance of potentially threatening debt-related information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0FC5282-5F2E-4C2E-AAAE-31F101F3240E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants who completed the contemplation questionnaire were less likely to avoid potentially threatening debt-related information compared to the control group.
