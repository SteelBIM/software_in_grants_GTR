We will do this by exploiting discrete electronic components as chemical sensors that are compatible with unique microfluidic chips for minimising the overall cost of the device in combination with small size enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) chambers that minimise antibody requirements. We aspire achieving this by adapting well established manufacturing techniques, currently employed in fabricating printed-circuit boards (PCBs), that could effortlessly render bespoke functionalised electrodes coupled with um-scale fluidic channels/chambers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The interdisciplinary work proposed within this program seeks adapting existing manufacturing processes, currently used in mass-producing printed circuit boards, for developing bespoke, disposable diagnostics. As this technology will be clinically applicable in a large variety of diseases, the anticipated impact expands across three main areas: (1) Societal (2) Economic (3)Academic.

Societal: The proposed research will develop a platform technology for low cost diagnostics and will have wide societal benefits in terms of public health. The proposed research will be focus on tuberculosis diagnosis - although only one aspect of tuberculosis control it is perhaps the most important. Currently there are several unmet needs in TB diagnosis, which include rapidity of diagnosis, affordability, simplicity and the ability to generate same-day results preferably at point-of-care. At present a return visit is required to access test results and as a result, time to treatment is prolonged and default rates are significant. A good diagnostic tool that can provide results rapidly will be invaluable in our ability to control this disease, especially in low resource settings. In terms of use, the technology can be utilised to provide reliable proteomic algorithms as well as experimental redundancy for minimising false positive results. In addition, when compared to conventional ELISA, significantly smaller sample volumes are required. These attributes are thus essential for developing a more reliable medical intervention without compromising the overall cost and discomfort of patients in intensive care units.
 
Economic: The main beneficiaries of the research stand to be industrial manufacturers of medical devices, and our industrial partner Newbury Electronics. By utilizing well-established PCB fabrication techniques, the research outputs could represent significant growth opportunities for Newbury Electronics by extending their portfolio into the diagnostics sector (valued at $13.8bn in 2011) and capturing potential high growth in the UK. The proposed research provides an alternative paradigm in manufacturing high-throughput, reliable yet low-cost diagnostic platforms and is thus anticipated that it will attract substantial interest world-wide. Multi-billion global businesses such as Life Sciences and Roche have invested substantially in CMOS technologies, as a means to develop advanced medical devices. Nonetheless, as discussed in this proposal, this approach only offers benefits when an extremely high density of sensing sites is required (as in DNA-sequencing), which is not the case for POC diagnostics. Aside from pharmaceutical and medical device sectors, we see potential impact in bio-defense and environmental monitoring. 
Bringing in new potential collaborations, commercial outcomes and through effective dissemination of this work we will strengthen the UK's academic and commercial position. We have had enquiries from GlaxoSmithKline, who have expresses interest in exploiting this technology, particularly in drug toxicology assays and other clinicians who are interested in pursuing clinical outcomes of this type of technology.
 
Academic: By combining the multi-disciplinary strengths of our collaborators and the host research groups we aim to:
- Innovate using the ingredients from different disciplines for enhancing the knowledge economy.
- Develop end-to-end infrastructure from a range of technologies, design methodologies and clinical applications.
- Cultivate inter-disciplinary IP for accelerating the commercialization of the proposed technology.
- Foster the training of highly skilled researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>869558</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>75000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Cyprus, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD Scholarships</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>AG Leventis Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>3EAE32E3-136D-46B2-A994-B66B44768395</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>75000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Cyprus, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>PhD sholarship in Nano/bio sciences</gtr:description><gtr:end>2021-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>AG Leventis Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E23AE2FE-594B-4288-979E-B9375B012BEC</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CRACK-IT</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-07-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F9B7A7D3-C9BC-4D85-8852-0E26FB85F25D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our platform technology is currently optimised in collaboration with external to this project partners (e.g. Dr Spiros Garbis - University of Southampton) for detecting a panel of prostate cancer markers.

Currently, custom made chip holders are utilized along with/or individual fluidic interconnects; all current solutions require skilled and experienced people to handle them and attach them appropriately to avoid leakages. Most of these rely in attaching interconnects vertically, through vias, and utilizing sealing apparatuses like o-rings or ferrules, while all horizontal geometries rely in mechanical bolting of the interconnects to thick, rigid (eg glass) substrates. With our invention we supply a plug and play, side-interfacing solution embodied in the microfluidic chip substrate itself, eliminating the problem of chip inlet sealing. The interfacing relies on the self-alignment of the microfluidic chip interfacing with the external interconnect, through a comb-like geometry. This geometry is realized directly on the microfluidic chip by micromachining it to the desired shape, thus eliminating the need for additional assembly steps of external connectors that typically compromise the sealing integrity.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F3DDB97D-16B6-4969-AB17-D46036074241</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This technique allows to effortlessly and reliably link a disposable fluidic cartridge with an analyser.

Several reference electrodes have been proposed and utilized like saturated calomel electrodes, Ag/AgCl electrodes etc. Until now several approaches have been followed to integrate microfabricated reference electrodes in microfluidic devices, however all of them are integrated with standard metal deposition techniques on Si or paper substrates, compatible with CMOS fabricated sensors. With our invention we propose a PCB compatible fabrication process for integrating Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, in one of the possible embodiments. These PCB reference electrodes can also be integrated in multilayer PCB structures. The reference electrodes could be of planar or via architecture, with the latter simultaneously serving as an air exhaust/outlet that could minimise inconsistent sample loading in integrated microfluidic networks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1A2CD540-89BB-4F1D-B81B-313AEB31F423</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reference electrodes stability and position with respect to the sensing electrodes could have an enormous impact on the attainable sensitivity of a point-of-care system.

Until now, CMOS technologies have been proposed with increased sensitivity, however too expensive to be disposable, due to the difficulty of interfacing them with microfluidic channels, delivering the biological sample. The low-cost approach of passive electrode sensors traditionally exploits planar geometries. With our invention we propose increasing the effective sensing area of the sensing electrodes, extending them in the z-direction in a cylindrical geometry. This way we have a 2*L/r larger effective sensing area (L:via depth, r:via radius, L&amp;gt;r), thus increasing sensing sensitivity within the same chip footprint. The second innovation of this sensing geometry we propose is that the sample volume to be analysed (directly affecting sensing reliability and repeatability) is easily confined and predefined by the size of the cylinder (Vsample=pr2L). This concept is easily implementable in PCB technologies (conventional via drilling, Cu / Au plating), maintaining the cost of the diagnostic device low, allowing for PCB microfluidics integration. This cylindrical electrode can be functionalized to sense application-driven diseases by printing/immobilizing the antibodies of interest in each well.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B740DACB-F18C-4639-A1D6-02B53BC74E19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our sensing approach is rather versatile as the sensing specificity arises from the type of antibodies that are blinded on the sensors' surface.
