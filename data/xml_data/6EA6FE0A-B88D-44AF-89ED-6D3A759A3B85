This is performed so that subtle trends which arise as pre-cursors to more serious incidents can be detected in advance and used to proactively manage risk. The same technique is also used as a way of meeting environmental and economic goals through improved operational efficiency, fuel consumption and maintenance. 

FDM is relevant to the railway industry because since 2005 all trains now have to carry similar on-board recorders. The primary motivation is to provide accident investigators with an invaluable diagnostic tool, but like the aviation sector, because accidents are comparatively rare a far greater quantity of data is collected on normal, routine, non-accident journeys. As a result, recorder data in the rail industry represents a significantly underused resource. 

The proposed research relates to a class of problem which occurs firmly at the human/system interface and which is shared by both the aviation and rail sectors. Both domains experience problems, for example, Signals Passed At Danger (or SPADs) and Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT), where several safety systems are defeated by human operators and otherwise fully functional trains or aircraft are placed in highly unsafe conditions. Problems such as these fall within the purview of Human Factors. On-board recorder data, be it from the rail or aviation sectors, represents a novel source of input for established human factors methodologies targeted at addressing them. 

The primary goal of the research, therefore, will be to couple recorder data to human factors methods in a way not previously attempted. The outcome will be 'leading indicators' of problems which, so far, have proven resistant to conventional safety interventions. Related to this are leading indicators, or metrics, that could help to inform ongoing research into operational efficiency, 'eco-driving', and potentially cost-saving insights into future maintenance practices. These opportunities can be systematically examined with reference both to human factors methods and to the mature FDM processes that currently exist in the aviation industry. 

The project is set against, and motivated by, a wider backdrop of European rail interoperability, a desire to maximise the environmental benefits of rail travel and the UK's position as a world leader in FDM processes. Whilst the research has at its core an innovative programme of theoretical advance, it is also coupled to several near-term applications. Firstly, the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) seek to inform (and be informed of) best practice in other transport domains and the proposed project aims to provide a conduit for such knowledge. Secondly, both the CAA and the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) are actively seeking leading indicators of safety related problems, particularly those which occur at the human/system interface. The project will map important theoretical developments in human factors methods to these real-world applications. Third, the proposed research is directly relevant to current industry projects managed by the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB), including several relating to safety management systems, eco-driving and route knowledge. 

In summary, the proposed research represents a highly innovative approach to understanding and diagnosing issues which occur at the boundary of humans and transport systems. It is also an example of research with high economic and societal impacts, and an example of research application with great potential to develop further work and collaborations with industry partners.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?

Four direct beneficiaries of the research have been identified and will be providing support to the project:

1. The Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC). 
2. The Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB). 
3. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).
4. Aerobytes Ltd (a UK Flight Data Management Company who provide a range of FDM services to the aviation sector). 

Four further indirect beneficiaries have also been identified:

1. The Human Factors Group at Network Rail Ltd.
2. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB)
3. The UK Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB).
4. The Human Factors Unit at National Air Traffic Services (NATS).

Wider beneficiaries have been identified as:

1. UK rail passengers (in terms of improved comfort and safety)
2. UK train operators (in terms of improved safety performance and favourable actuarial impacts on insurance against operational risks)
3. UK economy and society (by reducing the liklihood and cost of accidents and maintaining a leading position in FDM and transport safety)

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?

Key benefits to flow from the proposed research are both economic (i.e. potential cost saving strategies relating to operational efficiencies and safety) and health related (i.e. improved diagnosis of potential problems at the human/system interface). All participating stakeholders will benefit from cross-industry/disciplinary insights and best-practice resulting from the novel use of human factors techniques and recorder data. Specifically, ATOC's Safety and Operational Standards Forums will directly benefit from research into leading indicators of human performance problems. The CAA's Safety Regulation Group will benefit from state of the art insight into human factors methods and their relation to mature FDM processes, as well as insight into an alternative transport domain. RSSB (and the rail industry at large) will benefit from best practice arising from the aviation industry as well as insights relevant to the following projects: T852 - The application of leading and lagging indicators to the rail industry, T847 - Safety management system guidance and good practice and T839 - Eco-driving. 

WHAT WILL BE DONE TO ENSURE BENEFIT?

One of the goals of the proposed research is for it to serve as a conduit for knowledge to flow between industries and disciplines. A number of explicit activities are planned to service this objective. Firstly, RSSB have agreed to host regular stakeholder forums at their London headquarters at which RSSB, ATOC, Aerobytes Ltd. and the CAA can have the opportunity to guide the research towards industrially relevant goals and facilitate early identification of future exploitation routes. Secondly, an explicit communications plan will be put in place (managed by the PI) to identify further beneficiaries and release project outputs to them as appropriate. In addition, a project website/portal will be hosted by Heriot-Watt University at which project details and outputs can be viewed. Third, resource will be provided to work closely with Aerobytes Ltd. in order to develop a proof of concept demonstrator. This will provide a simple yet powerful illustration of the mappings between theoretical/methodological knowledge flowing from the academic sector, and the practical applications of that knowledge within the rail and aviation sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Project Briefing at the UK Civil Aviation Authority</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D927E2DB-F68B-49B0-B49B-909A85382C0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes of the research project were presented to key stakeholders within the Civil Aviation Authority.

A peculiar side effect of improving safety trends in both transport sectors is that the ability to collect data is now out of proportion to the number of accidents where it would ever be used. Fortunately, the UK aviation industry leads the world in using black box data before accidents or serious safety concerns even occur. The prediction of emergent safety issues from data on normal operations is called Flight Data Monitoring. This project is about transferring this knowledge into the rail sector. It is also about making data monitoring approaches better at detecting a particularly troublesome class of accident that features in both industries' strategic safety plans. There are five key findings:

The project highlights that the data collected from black box recorders in the rail industry is a significantly underused resource. 

The project demonstrates that the Flight Data Monitoring approach is compatible with data collected from train operations. It shows significant potential to improve and assure safety in the face of increasing operational intensity and risk exposure. 

The project shows that the class of accident, or near accident, which is prominent within rail and aviation strategic safety plans is comprised of distinct yet shared psychological features. 

The project has innovated six Human Factors Leading Indicators. These provide highly novel predictive insights into driver/pilot behaviour based on transport data recordings. In doing so they respond to industry strategic safety concerns and have been made compatible with existing Flight Data Monitoring approaches. 

The project opens up a highly impactful future research agenda.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The work leads directly to the continued development of a Rail Data Monitoring programme. Such a programme could be used across the industry and/or by individual train operating companies. The benefits of 'Flight' Data Monitoring are well established and the same benefits can be accrued in the rail sector. 

The Human Factors Leading Indicators are designed to be easily incorporated into existing Flight Data Monitoring software tools, facilitating their testing, validation and subsequent use on large scale transport datasets. 

Black box data recorders are becoming widespread in other transport domains and the same benefits/Human Factors insights apply. The work is being expanded into the Logistics/Road Freight sector under an EPSRC Grant entitled 'The Centre for Sustainable Road Freight'. The research has been presented to the Rail Safety and Standards Board (RSSB) in the context of scoping a future research project. 

The research will be presented to the Association of Train Operating Companies' (ATOC) Operations Standards Forum in order to identify specific exploitation routes within the rail sector. 

The research has been presented to Flight Data Monitoring stakeholders at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to identify specific exploitation routes within the aviation sector. 

The results have been shared with Greater Anglia Trains who provided the current dataset and are seeking ways to make better use of it. 

The underpinning science has been exploited through academic channels such as international conferences and articles in the peer reviewed press.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AE0C206F-B39E-41C1-AE34-8F39A2A3A43F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Healthcare,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B9CC4017-4D95-4A13-B655-8DBC4B945E1F"><gtr:id>B9CC4017-4D95-4A13-B655-8DBC4B945E1F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Broken components versus broken systems: why it is systems not people that lose situation awareness</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognition, Technology &amp;
