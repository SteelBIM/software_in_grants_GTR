While 'conventional' fluorescence intensity imaging is widely used for molecular biology to visualise distributions of proteins that have been 'labelled' by attaching them to convenient fluorophores, it is relatively difficult to obtain quantitative data concerning factors that affect the efficiency of the fluorescence process. This is important because, in principle, the fluorescence efficiency is a function of the local fluorophore environment and can give information concerning what is happening to the fluorophore, whereas conventional fluorescence intensity imaging merely reports where it is located. Intensity-based measurements of fluorescence efficiency can be unreliable because of variations in factors such as attenuation, fluorophore concentration or optical pathlength, which can be very difficult to quantify. Fluorescence lifetime measurements are insensitive to these factors. This makes FLIM useful for the new technique of Forster Resonant Energy transfer (FRET) where fluorescence is quenched (diminished) by adjacent fluorophores. This quenching of fluorescence by energy transfer between molecules requires them to be within ~ 10 nm and so this provides a means for biologists to image when pairs of proteins are interacting. FLIM is useful because the quenched fluorophores exhibit a shorter fluorescence lifetime. At Imperial we have a range of interdisciplinary research programmes exploiting FLIM including FLIM-FRET imaging of inter-cell signalling and signal pathways within cells, which are important to understand the mechanism underlying diseases such as cancer. Successful FRET experiments require careful optimisation of fluorophore labelling that must be tested by control experiments. Other FLIM experiments require characterisation of the radiation emitted by fluorescence probes. Our current tool of choice for FLIM &amp;amp; FRET is a confocal microscope but, with many biologists and other collaborators competing for time on this expensive instrument, we have a major bottleneck that is limiting research progress. The proposed new tool would permit FRET and control experiments on protein or fluorophores to be done 'off-line'. It would also be useful to characterise fluorophores for many other FLIM experiments. Furthermore it would be user-friendly and relatively easy to replicate so we could envisage spreading this technique to our collaborators within Imperial's life science departments and at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR). This would have a very positive impact on progress towards establishing new FLIM and FRET experiments and would also greatly relieve the congestion on our confocal microscope system. We measure fluorescence lifetime by exciting molecules with a short pulse of light and observing how they lose this energy by emitting photons. The wavelength of the photons emitted and the timescale over the fluorescence signal decays are characteristic of the different fluorophore molecules. For this project we aim to develop an automatic hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime measurement system that would simultaneously record the fluorescence emission in terms of the wavelength and temporal decay (lifetime) profiles to provide a full spectro-temporal characterisation of the fluorophore emission. This new tool will be applicable to cuvette measurements and homogenous assays in multiwell plate arrays, which in high-throughput screening are used for drug discovery. It will also be configurable with fibre-optic probes for in situ point measurements.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We aim to develop a single-channel hyperspectral fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) system combined with an electronically tunable excitation source to permit full excitation-emission-lifetime matrices to be routinely recorded. This new tool will be applicable to cuvette measurements and homogenous assays in well plate arrays. It will also be configurable with fibre-optic probes for in situ point measurements in diverse samples including bioreactors and tissue. Our particular applications relate to FLIM microscopy including FLIM-FRET imaging of phosphorylation at the immune synapse of NK cells and GTP-ras binding. Successful FRET experiments require careful optimisation of probe expression and control experiments. Currently we use a confocal microscope with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) for FRET but with up to 10 users competing for time on this instrument, we have a major bottleneck that is limiting research progress. The proposed instrument would facilitate non-imaging FRET and control experiments on homogenous protein or other solutions and spatially integrated measurements of cells. Other FLIM projects also require temporal and spectral characterisation of fluorescence probes for which this would provide a valuable resource - particularly to validate our novel wide-field hyperspectral FLIM microscopes. Because this new instrument would be user-friendly and relatively easy to replicate, we could envisage spreading this technique to our life science collaborators within Imperial and at the ICR. This would positive impact progress towards establishing new FLIM and FRET experiments and would also greatly relieve the congestion on our confocal microscope system. We have already demonstrated the efficacy of an electronically tunable source for FLIM and here propose to use a new commercially available all-fibre integrated system that we will adapt for electronic tunability.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2008-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98275</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kentech Instruments Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Kentech Instruments Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:id>E2493B19-5F1B-40A3-9296-E3C6BB5F2685</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications

The main output of this grant was the development and evaluation of a novel multidimensional fluorimeter exploiting a tunable supercontinuum-based laser source and resolving excitation and emission spectra, as well as lifetime and polarisation in a single instrument - and in a single measurement if required. This instrument is enclosed on a breadboard of 90x60 cm and so is portable as well as convenient. It is designed to be used with cuvettes as with conventional fluorimeters but also incorporates a fibre-optic probe to permit studies of remote samples in situ, such as biological tissue and in culture media, or in vivo, and which can be readily applied to multiwell plate readers. It is fully computer controlled and so permits rapid analysis of multiple samples. The internal supercontinuum source provides excitation from ~ 400 to &amp;gt;800 nm and the instrument has been designed to permit rapid coupling of external excitation sources as required, e.g. u.v. lasers for exciting endogenous fluorescence. 
This combination of all these measurement modalities in a compact &amp;quot;hands-off&amp;quot; instrument exploiting recently available fibre laser-based supercontinuum technology to provide tunable excitation is unique and highly enabling. Within the project it has been validated with fluorescence standards and has been applied to FRET measurements in solution, to characterise a new fluorescence-based membrane probe, to study staurosporine and to provide a label-free readout of cartilage degeneration in fresh tissue.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This new instrument has a vast range of applications, many of which we have subsequently demonstrated including in vivo label-free needle biopsy of patients or ex vivo tissue, solution-based FRET studies of molecular interactions, readouts of metabolic changes in humans, animals and plants, and characterisation of fluorescence probes. It is a convenient way to access a wide range of data from fluorescent samples.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D1433849-21B3-481F-B829-AF00B1DCA2F0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We developed a compact single-point autofluorescence endoscopic (SAFE) probe to measure the spectral and lifetime properties of tissue autofluorescence in vivo. This instrument can enable spectrally resolved lifetime measurements via a specially designed fibre-optic probe that is 2.4 mm diameter such that it can pass through the (2.8 mm) biopsy channel of a standard clinical endoscope. It has been engineered to be self-contained on a trolley and is implemented with gain-switched picosecond diode lasers for excitation in the u.v. and blue. FLIM is implemented with time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) and spectral discrimination is provided by either a spectrometer or dichroic beam splitters and filters. We have also incorporated a spectrometer to record the diffuse reflectivity spectrum for white light illumination.

This multimodal single-point fibre-optic probe thus provides real-time measurements of tissue properties and, because it bins all the photons detected from a ~mm area of tissue into only a few detection channels, provides high signal to noise ratio with sufficient numbers of detected photons to permit (spectrally-resovled) analysis of complex fluorescence decay profiles, such as are typically encountered with tissue autofluorescence. This instrument has been successfully applied in clinical trials of skin cancer (at Lund University Hospital) and of GI cancer (at Charing Cross Hospital). It is straightforward to use during clinical procedures and will continue to be used in clinical investigations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A219D17B-D860-4532-B8BC-A7842E1220E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The successful trial with this instrument led to further trials with similar instruments being undertaken funded by a new EPSRC project.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Single-point autofluorescence endoscopic (SAFE) probe</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved Technique/Technology</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>The main output of this project was a novel instrument to analyse fluorescence emission with respect to excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, fluorescence decay time and polarisation. This it can be used to obtain multidimensional fluorescence datasets that provide exquisite contrast between different fluorophores or states of fluorophores. Unlike a microscope, all the emitted photons are collected as a single point measurement (i.e. a homogeneous assay) and the resulting large number of photons is sufficient to enable the analysis of complex decay profiles with spectral and polarisation resolution. This can be applied to acquire excitation-emission-lifetime matrices (or subsets thereof), which can be used to study changes in fluorescence to report on the local molecular environment or it can be used to distinguish different fluorophores - for example using the time resolution to discriminate between fluorophores with similar spectral properties. It can also be used for FRET studies. The capability for time-resolved and polarisation-resolved fluorescence measurements enable time-resolved anisotropy studies, e.g. of molecular rotational dynamics. The instrument is designed for solution-based studies in cuvettes and also can make measurements of remote samples via a fibre-optic probe. After this project finished, it was also modified to enable automated homogenous measurements of samples arrayed in multiwell plates.
