systems</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N034368/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Most of the world's population is now living in cities and travelling more. As a result we are more likely to come into contact with infections that we would not have been exposed to just a few decades ago due to interactions with more people. The environment plays an important role in the transmission of some infections and it is possible to reduce the transmission of such disease by better filtration of water and air. Some filtration systems are currently used which physically stop pathogens such as bacteria. However these systems cannot stop virus particles, are expensive, require frequent maintenance and careful disposal. 

The aim of this project is to design one air and one water filter which will actively kill bacteria and viruses, thereby reducing their numbers in the environment. These filters will require less maintenance and be inexpensive to produce. During the project, we will first test the antimicrobial effect of a variety of nanoparticles. These will then be modified chemically so that they can be incorporated into materials that are suitable for water and air filtration. The filters containing the antimicrobial nanoparticles will be produced using a new EPSRC funded spinning technology developed at UCL. Once we have produced the antimicrobial filtration materials, we will test their ability to kill viruses in air and bacteria in water. We will test filters with different concentrations of antimicrobial nanoparticles and with different depths. We will also make sure that the filters are effective at flow rates that are used in the real world. 

The antimicrobial filters will be of most interest to the healthcare industry in the first instance, but they will also be relevant to busy public buildings (such as schools and care homes) and transport vehicles (such as airplanes). Furthermore, the filters will be capable of oxidising non-biological materials, like tar and pollution particulates and will improve air quality in a range of indoor environments. During the project we will be collaborating with industrial partners (including Pall Corporation, the world's biggest filtration company) and clinicians to ensure that we produce a viable product. At the end of the project, the technology will be validated and ready for scale-up production and we plan to apply for further funding for a collaborative project with industry in order to do this.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>218931</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Face-masks could be as an artistic &amp;amp; creative facial product.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEDCBD2D-B526-4A67-921A-F9966F6E5626</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Antimicrobial face-mask will be useful in hospitals, public places and public transportation systems.

These synthetic composites consisted of multi-elemental components (i.e. carbon, tungsten, copper and silver) in particle sizes ranging from 10 - 50 nm. Within these formulations, especially in the case of dispersing Silver particles in aqueous suspension, surface treatments were performed using diluted ammonium hydroxide. This treatment method was found highly efficient, additional 50 uL of diluted ammonium hydroxide solution (0.3%) totally dispersed 1% wt/v aqueous Silver after ultra power sonication.</gtr:description><gtr:id>479C755D-BFAD-4835-A785-EFF7FAFA32FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far, these newly synthesized nanoparticle composites (AMNP 1-7) have proven to exhibit excellent antimicrobial effect in P. aeruginosa (Gram-ve bacteria). In particular AMNP4 and AMNP6 showed to reach 99.99% (log ratio) of killing rate at concentration 0.1 %. Preliminary data suggested that antimicrobial effect was enhanced by the presence of multi-elemental composites contained in these samples, the data also suggested high dosage of Silver particles is not necessary. An overview of the investigation implied optimal antimicrobial affects on particular microbes can be manipulated by applying the correct ratio of metals components in a formulation. The differentiation in metal ratio present in these formulations also implied a reduction of toxicity levels can be achieved, which has always been a major concern of using Silver nanoparticles in healthcare applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Antimicrobial formulation creations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9F902A38-6DEF-465E-9C44-FC43C5422CC7"><gtr:id>9F902A38-6DEF-465E-9C44-FC43C5422CC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gyrospun antimicrobial nanoparticle loaded fibrous polymeric filters.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Materials science &amp; engineering.
