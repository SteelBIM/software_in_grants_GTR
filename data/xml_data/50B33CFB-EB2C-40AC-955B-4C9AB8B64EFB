Energy demand is reduced due to its potential for seamless integration of novel pervasive sensors with legacy technologies for indoor and outdoor monitoring using existing power line infrastructures. The project builds upon our expertise in communication and information technology at King's College London and the pioneering mote technology developed at the Newcastle University in the EU ASTRA, and the EPSRC MESSAGE, projects. The impact of these results will be significant at a time when UK Government acknowledges the crucial role of Intelligent Vehicle and Transport Systems, IVTS, technology to make more efficient use of existing infrastructure in the delivery of a low carbon transport systems for the future. The development of dense, pervasive, multitask sensor networks, that provide real-time traffic flow information and monitor several environmental factors (such as pollutants from vehicles) has been demonstrated in MESSAGE to facilitate the development of more efficient traffic control schemes, thus leading to a significant reduction in the energy consumption and environmental pollution. We aim to disseminate the results not only through outstanding publications but importantly through existing links in the regional transport boards, Foresight Intelligent Infrastructure Forum in UK and Europe, and ITS World Congress generating knowledge dialogue at all stages of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>241942</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Svitzer</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sensor trial in Port ship</gtr:description><gtr:id>D60DF863-6C09-4304-B5E2-DF10B9E21D8D</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Established preliminary agreement with Svitzer to deploy a mote sensor array on board of a ship in Tees port.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department For Environment, Food And Rural Affairs (DEFRA)</gtr:department><gtr:description>DEFRA</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B229DA4-83AD-4684-8D73-D6646A789EC9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SERCO</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>SERCO</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D45DBFA-8E13-4CC6-919E-D40E665377ED</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Transport</gtr:department><gtr:description>Department for Transport</gtr:description><gtr:id>3FFD9178-D77A-4F04-A27C-A1163C7373AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016 invited to review a paper on emissions following the Volkswagen scandal

The algorithms used to calibrate for both humidity and temperature were further refined. The development of the system to accommodate the ozone sensor helped measure the cross sensitivity of the nitrogen dioxide sensor to ozone. New sensor technology was released by the manufacturer and they were found to fail at high levels of humidity experienced in Manchester. Knowledge acquired during the LAMPPOST helped to prove the need to address the dilution of the electrolyte due t0o high humidity. In more recent years we have supported the calibration the series of new generation sensors in collaboration with the spin out company of the MESSAGE project Envirowatch. As a result Alphasense have responded with a fit-for-purpose sensor with a guarantee limit of 80% maximum humidity and Envirowatch have modified their funding model to replace the sensors regularly each 6months (as opposed to 18m-24m previously) 

Engagement with Envirowatch continues with regular updates on progress. The Alphasense company who make the sensors and in particular the nitrogen dioxide sensor have responded the problems identified by our deployment of the sensors in the field by upgrading the sensor technology. The first deployment in Manchester failed due to prolonged humidity which diluted the electrolyte. Different electrolytes have been used; then the orifice of the sensor was made smaller; cross sensitivity to ozone was drawn to their attention and a filter was fitted; more recently a fourth electrode was added to correct for temperature ad humidity but at the expense to sensitivity. TORG have worked alongside the company to develop a solution. The most recent sensor is now 'fit for purpose' and we are currently engaged in a full scale evaluation of sensors in collaboration with colleagues in the Urban Observatory facilities.

The research led to further developments in the sensors and the emote system to be driven with and without paper. More specifically (a) identified the need for improvements in the design of the sensor to be fit for purpose for use on the roadside. improvements have been made by the manufacturers in response to our findings so that with work continuing after the Lamppost project a robust sensor has been recently marketed and (b) an emote design has been to include the gateway functionality in the emote technology so that they can be deployed independently of an array of emotes with a gateway. These systems are now useful for indoor measurement as well as for isolated locations, on motorways, in rural areas and residential streets or wherever there is power available.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are many other pervasive sensor manufacturers internationally now benefiting from our work supporting Envirowatch on the evaluation of sensors as they are now manufactured with substantial improvement which will benefit all who purchase them.
