However, the vulnerability of young people, and concerns about their plight, is not a new phenomenon. In 1984 unemployment among 16-24 year olds reached 19.6 per cent and in the 1980s, as with other recessions, youth unemployment (which is always two to three times higher than all-age unemployment) was a major cause of concern, leading to talk about a ?lost generation?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using a secondary analysis of data from a contemporary UK dataset, Understanding Society, combined with secondary analysis of two ?historical? datasets from the UK in the 1980s (Young Adults and the Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets) this research aims to answer the question - In what ways have the experiences of unemployed, insecure and vulnerable 18-25 year-olds changed between two key periods of economic instability in the UK?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this paper we will reflect upon our initial attempts at comparing the experiences of 18?25 year-olds in the 1980s and c2010 (two periods characterised by high youth unemployment) and consider how we intend to capture changes in the landscape of precarity over the last thirty years.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1.Who will benefit from this research? The are numerous beneficiaries from this research including academics, policy makers, practitioners, politicians, postgraduate students, early career researchers, academic and professional networks.
2.How will they benefit from this research? They will benefit from the research in line with the ESRC guidance on 'What is Impact' - Instrumentally, Conceptually and in respect of Capacity Building. The instrumental benefits of the research centre on the connections of the team to the policy environment and their commitment to ensuring that this work makes a difference to the lives of young people. Throughout the life of the project and beyond, we will develop and maintain a dialogue with key stakeholders in government, the third sector and among the wide range of private organisations that provide support and training for young people who are unemployed or vulnerable to unemployment. During the the project we will engage directly with stakeholders with whom we are in contact, including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the International Trade Union Confederation, the UK Trade Union Confederation and the UK Government Departments for Business Innovation and Skills, Education, Work and Pensions and the UK Commission for Employment and Skills. These stakeholders will benefit from early release data on how to combat the adverse effects of economic transformation on young adults. The conceptual benefits emerge from the importance of our research questions for academics and policy makers working in the area of youth transitions and youth employment/unemployment. Addressing the questions through the secondary analysis of existing data will challenge academics and policy makers to reconsider some of the ways in issues of youth employment have been/are conceptualized and, therefore, the research will make a significant contribution to academic and policy knowledge in this area. The research will reveal new insights into the situation of young people in the 1980s whilst also revealing the distinctive characteristics of the contemporary youth labour market particularly for those at the margins. Overall, the research will make a clear contribution to the academic, political and practitioner debates on how to combat the adverse effects of the current harsh economic conditions on young adults. In terms of capacity building this project will extend expertise in secondary analysis to develop further the skills of the team members in using large and complex datasets, such as Understanding Society as a source of secondary data to complement existing skills. This will serve to augment individual career development and offers potential for academic output championing the secondary analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data and maximising the use of existing datasets. Academic users will benefit from the significantly enhanced impact potential of combining three previously unconnected studies. In addition, combining data from the three studies is likely to increase, and reassert, the impact and significance of the historical data by highlighting the contemporary relevance of archived data for academic users.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>142428</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Making of the Precariat.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CFC5857E-11DD-4A59-9041-B887B02CA8A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture to National Institute for Careers Education and Counselling

Given Professor O'Connor expertise in precarious work and the labour market she was a invited panel member. Henrietta O'Connor - one of the panellists and a Professor of Sociology at the University of Leicester - said the report by Alan Milburn made for 'depressing reading', but was encouraged by the outcome of the debate. She said:

&amp;quot;This was a timely debate given the publication of the report on social mobility earlier this week. It was fascinating to hear the types of strategies being used by graduate employers to actively seek to employ graduates from a wide range of social backgrounds.

&amp;quot;It is clear that forward thinking employers are as engaged as universities in recognising that future leaders come from a wide and diverse range of backgrounds and are increasingly embedding recruitment strategies designed to appeal to all graduates and not just an elite few.&amp;quot;

Combining historical and contemporary data presented a number of challenges. For example, repurposing historic interview schedules from past 'legacy projects' is a complex, often problematic, approach to research. Complexities include: i) coding errors, inconsistencies in the use of terms, definitions, abbreviations; ii) usability and clarity of handwriting; iii) the absence of contextual information inhibiting data interpretation. These complexities took considerable time to resolve. This needs to be considered by future secondary analysts given the potential lead time between preparation, analysis and impact. As such this remains an on-going project and we are just beginning to engage directly with policy makers and stakeholders. We have presented papers and organized activities for policy makers, practitioners (e.g. government officials, mental health practitioners etc.) and academics.

Publications and Other Outputs

We have also produced a number of outputs from the research which will generate more impact once published and disseminated widely via planned public launch events and engagement with policy makers:

Two fully digitized datasets of previously unavailable data on youth employment. These will be made available via the UK data archive:

? Young Adults in the Labour Market (Full digital dataset). 
? The Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets (Full digital dataset).

Data from Understanding Society wave 1 was used to assess the numbers of young people aged 18-25 in precarious labour market positions. Making a distinction between 'deep precarity' (the formally unemployed, other workless groups - such as those in caring roles and the long-term sick and disabled - and part-time workers working so few hours that they lacked legal protections (&amp;lt;16 hours per week)) and 'shallow precarity' (part-time workers (16-34 hours) plus those working full-time on temporary contracts we found that 36% of young people were in the deep precariat and a further 21% in the shallow precariat: showing that 57% occupied marginal positions in which they either lacked work or lacked legislative security. Among the deep precariat, 19% had never been in paid employment. Females were more likely than males to occupy precarious positions, as were those who lived in areas of high unemployment. There were clear associations between labour market precarity and negative well-being.

2. Using data from Young Adults in the Labour Market (1983) and The Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets (1986), we devised a framework for classifying young people's position in the labour market retrospectively. This was operationalized via the characteristics of each local labour market and on the respondent's then current and/or first labour market position. The labour markets were defined as 'prosperous', 'declining' and 'depressed'. The young people were categorized by 'types of precarity'. We found that at the point of their first/current labour market position, young people were more likely to be traditional employees in prosperous labour markets but that this type of employment declined as the labour market conditions deteriorated. Those in the depressed labour markets were less likely to be in traditional employment and most likely to belong to the deep precariat group. However, considering precarity alone young people were more likely to be in the deep precariat group than the shallow across all the labour market types.

3. Much of the literature on precarity carries an assumption that the phenomenon is relatively new; predating the recent recession by around a decade but severely accelerated by recession. Using the same definitions of precarity to compare the legacy data with USoc, we found that levels of precarity among young people in the 1980s were very similar (55% in either deep or shallow precarity in the 1980s compared to 57% today). The key difference being that more young people in the 1980s were workless rather than in insecure forms of employment.

4. Repurposing original interview schedules from past 'legacy project' offers much analytical potential but is also a complex and often problematic approach to research. Complexities include: i) coding errors, inconsistencies in the use of terms, definitions and abbreviations; ii) usability mediated by the clarity of handwriting; iii) the absence of contextual information makes data interpretation more challenging. While none of these complexities in and of themselves limit the overall value of the legacy data, each took considerable time to resolve. This needs to be considered fully by future secondary analysts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We envisage that the findings and data may be taken forward by ourselves and others in numerous ways. First, we have created, for the first time since their original collection, two complete datasets from the 'legacy' projects &amp;shy;- Young Adults in the Labour Market (1983) and The Changing Structure of Youth Labour Markets (1986). These datasets will be deposited in the UK Data archive for wider research use thus enabling further engagement with 'original data'. Second, our findings have fed into various dissemination and engagement events with academics, practitioners, employers and policymakers. The dissemination activities will continue via normal academic channels (publications, book launch, conferences) and continued attendance at public engagement events. Third, the findings have relevance for the academic and policy communities given that our results question existing assumptions relating to the longevity of the 'precarity phenomenon'. This has implications for policy formation especially relating to youth employment in times of economic hardship. Finally, the experiences of combining legacy and contemporary data have significant implications for research practice and secondary analysis.
