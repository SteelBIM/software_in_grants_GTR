The actions of the speech organs must be precisely timed with one another if speech is to sound natural and be easy to understand. Across different accents of English, speech timing and rhythm seem to differ, and unfamiliarity with an accent's timing intuitively seems to lead to trouble understanding it. Yet there is little research into this area. This project addresses three questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>How do accents differ in the timing patterns associated with particular word shapes?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Is comprehension disrupted if the &amp;quot;wrong&amp;quot; timing pattern is heard for a given accent?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do speakers of different accents adjust to one another's timing patterns in conversation?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The project looks at the accents of Glasgow, Buckie, Leeds, Cambridge, and at Bradford British Asian English. It investigates the fine details of timing in specific types of word, such as feeler, filler and feel a [bit ill]. Methodologies include phonetic analysis of both conversational and read speech, and perceptual experimentation. Results will be used to design further research on speech timing patterns, and ultimately to build collaboration with psychologists and neuroscientists in order to understand the kinds of mental 'clocks' people use to perceive speech.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136666</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>English as a Foreign Language (EFL) seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD5E43BF-D0F6-44F7-9110-4A011E77AD2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Non-native learners frequently struggle with the prosodic aspects of English, and the rhythms of Scottish accents differ dramatically from those of the widely-taught varieties Southern British or Mainstream American. It is interesting to explore how training in production and perception of the rhythms of an accent might help learners understand and be understood. In February 2012, we organised a half-day tutorial on rhythmic aspects of English as foreign language at the University of Glasgow. Around 20 international students at the University of Glasgow participated and feedback suggested they found the workshop very useful. This sparked an ongoing collaboration between the University of Glasgow and Micro-Phonics Ltd through an AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award explores these issues further.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/research/fundedresearchprojects/rhythmsinscotland/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch of Communicative Rhythms in Brain and Behaviour</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B332836-2CA0-4B9F-8C0C-BB5C4645595B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We held a launch event for a special issue of Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, entitled &amp;quot;Communicative rhythms in brain and behaviour&amp;quot; at the University of Glasgow on 25 November 2014.

We invited researchers who were based in Scotland and working on rhythm or closely related topics. Attendees included community musicians, speech therapists, and researchers in psychology, neuroscience, linguistics and music. In the morning session, the participants briefly presented their lab facilities, research programmes and complementary data, and outlined open questions they were interested in pursuing. The afternoon session consisted of several focus groups, each guided by a designated discussion leader, on themes according to participants' interests. We also heard a talk about collaborative funding opportunities, kindly offered by Edinburgh Research and Innovation group.

The poster sparked a number of interesting discussions.

(2) considerable networking activity, including the establishment of a network (Rhythms in Scotland), a Twitter feed and JISCmail list for the rhythm research community, an international interdisciplinary conference involving academics and speech and music therapists (Perspectives on Rhythm and Timing, 2012), and and resulting journal special issue (2014, see Publications) which has attracted media attention;

Motivated by an alternative, structural approach, we investigated linguistic factors affecting timing variation in four dialects (Cambridge, Glasgow, Leeds, and Bradford). We identified acoustic differences in timing across the dialects relating to the realisation of many levels of linguistic structure (prosodic boundaries and prominence, stress, word boundaries, syllable structure, and segmental inventory). We began to bridge the gap between these approaches, and proposed a new linguistically-informed perspective on rhythm measurement, the Multi-dimensional Dispersion Coefficient (MDC).



We then tested whether the observed dialectal differences affect perception. We created artificial meaningless sentences with real words embedded in them, and modified the word rhythm to be right or wrong for either Leeds or Glasgow accent. The wrong rhythm for their accent made listeners less accurate and slower at identifying words. 



Finally, we began to explore how people adjust temporal properties of their speech towards another speaker. We asked non-native speakers to imitate a difficult temporal pattern of English, and observed that convergence towards the model speaker was easy in a highly rhythmical task, but more difficult in other tasks.



This research has provoked many events and initiatives, from workshops on pronunciation learning through to an international conference. We are exploring potential applications in speech therapy, while a new collaboration with neuroscientists investigates the cerebral correlates of convergence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has applications in English pronunciation learning and teaching. In February 2012, we ran a Knowledge Exchange workshop on rhythm and stress in English pronunciation, which was offered to international students at Glasgow's universities. 20 learners listened to a mini-lecture and took part in pronunciation exercises where they listened, chanted, and sang. Participants enjoyed the workshop and awarded it very high ratings in a post-course questionnaire.

Working with a start-up, Micro-phonics Ltd, who produce software for English pronunciation teaching and learning, we have explored possibilities to incorporate material on rhythm into Micro-phonics lesson plans, and in 2014 obtained AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Award funding for a studentship to investigate this. 

Our production results and the corpus on which they are based have already aroused interest within the academic community. Our MDC metric is a new exploratory tool for rhythmic analysis that has potentially broad application across languages and regional and social dialects. It could also be applied to help understand data from disordered speech. We collaborated with Anja Lowit (Strathclyde) on a seminar for trainee speech therapists (March 2013).



Our perception study is one of very few on processing of unfamiliar accents that unpicks the specific consequences of fine phonetic differences for the dynamics of word recognition. It has the potential to change awareness within the field.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FBB4DAFF-E146-4926-8F49-B806B8FD8B5B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/critical/research/fundedresearchprojects/timinginaccentsofenglish/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4E881CAE-4BE6-40AF-BCB8-CE4F567200FE"><gtr:id>4E881CAE-4BE6-40AF-BCB8-CE4F567200FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Communicative rhythms in brain and behaviour.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
