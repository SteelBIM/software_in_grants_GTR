The Network will work in partnership with arts organisations to observe the development of works for public performance: 10 experimental works as part of the TaipeIDEA Festival, new physical theatre works by the Beijing Dance Academy (BDA) Company, a new work by spell#7 theatre company for the Singapore Arts Festival, an English National Opera production directed and choreographed by Carolyn Choa (from Hong Kong, currently resident in London) with designer Tim Yip, (from Hong Kong, currently resident in Beijing); and a series of experimental works as part of a new Summerhouse programme at The Place, London. The network will also work with Step Out Arts, a new arts agency designed to promote the work of British artists of East Asian descent.\n\nThe premise is that an increasingly cosmopolitan perspective is necessary, in order to destabilise past perceptions of an irretrievable difference epitomised by the term 'east-west divide'. In the performing arts this is often seen as tradition (East), versus modernity (West). In contrast, AIN wishes to explore the emergence of multiple modernities as evidenced in arts practices and performances, which the Network proposes represents events in a larger sphere. The skylines of Shanghai and Beijing are testament to the new realities.\n\nAIN will develop a forum for exchange and dissemination, including seminars and conferences, discussions for arts audiences in performance venues and interested members of the general public, as well as demonstrations of practical performance work accompanied by academic discussion and artist/academic exchange. In addition, public web forums will be a window into AIN's work. This range is designed to reach as wide an audience as possible and to promote 'real world' applications for research. By working with arts partners the network will draw on expertise in engaging the public, utilising venues which are accessible and familiar as well as helping arts organisations to extend their audiences. Furthermore the project will develop relationships with cross-cultural practitioners in which they are actively involved rather than simply the subjects of research. This will also shift the position of the academic observer in the rehearsal room or auditorium from one of disinterest to that of reflexive participation. The use of the internet will also be key to the network, both as an effective means of communication, documentation and dissemination; and in order to minimise the ecological impact of travel. \n \nThe dedicated website will allow access to the research to members of the public, as well as providing secure areas for academic exchange prior to publication. In addition it will be designed to be a resource and means of contact for individual researchers and for enquiries about the network. The case studies are designed to create a 'real-world' context for the network and to demonstrate the synergies between academia and other sectors. Whilst each case project contributes to a structure for the development of this AHRC-funded network, each is autonomous, in that each is externally funded and occurs within a public rather than an academic, critical economy.\n\nThe public seminars and conferences accompanying each case study will include educators and cultural policy makers who will debate the ramifications of the project and the requirements an increasingly globalised, intercultural and cosmopolitan world place on education and cultural policy. The findings of the research will be presented in academic and non-academic journals, seminars, conferences and an edited book will be produced after the two year period of the case studies: performance programmes will also give details of the research network and website access.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact beyond the academic sector is embedded in this proposal and is achieved through: working with artists, arts partners and audiences; involving education and cultural policy makers; brokering the partnership between China, Taiwan and the UK (cultural diplomacy, UK policy goals); using open web forums to engage the wider public, providing resources to support UK UG courses enhancing the internationalisation of UK education.\n\nAIN is designed to facilitate international exchange between academics, artists, arts organisations and their publics; as well as stimulating international policy debates in education and culture. Given the current relatively low profile of such relations within theatre, dance and performance studies in the UK, despite changing geopolitical conditions, there is a real imperative to develop dialogue and achieve outcomes in UG teaching, research, performance and cultural policy terms as well as raising public awareness.\n\nAIN achieves synergy through significant new partnerships with national and international arts organisations and artists, and policy-makers. The network brings together, for the first time, two leading arts institutions in China and Taiwan, enabling new dialogues to develop through both informal exchange and the intensive workshops accompanying the case studies. That these channels are opened in the pragmatic arenas of the rehearsal room and the stage means that new languages, which negotiate and respect cultural difference are intrinsic to the project as a result. The brokering of a 'licensed space' for artist, academic and institutional exchange is deemed significant as evidenced by discussion meetings with e.g. China's Ministry of Culture (Deputy Minister and Director of Western Europe Office); China Performing Arts Agency; Taiwan's UK Cultural Division and the Bureau for International Cultural and Education Relations (Director). In the UK, AIN assists the further development of the relatively new organisation, Step Out Arts, whose mission is to promote the visibility and development of British artists of East Asian descent. AIN participates therefore in enhancing the profile of arts and artists of an ethnic minority, traditionally considered to be under-represented, or even invisible, in British culture. AIN also facilitates a wider demographic engagement for organisations such as English National Opera and The Place. \nA close working relationship has been fostered with the British Council whose commitment to intercultural dialogue (ref: letter of support) indicates that AIN's proposed activities address broader UK policy initiatives. Impact will be spread widely through the national/international partner organisations as they are located across a range of scales of funding and production. This not only reaches a range of audiences, but also enhances policy debates concerning the imperatives and perceived benefits of differing structures and national/international funding strategies for the performing arts. \n Dissemination to a wider public via performance, and live and web-hosted discussion forums allows the research to achieve wide awareness. Recent changes in the political and economic climate in which the arts in Britain find themselves make this project timely and poised to contribute to a discussion of how aesthetic practice not only reflects such shifts, but also participates within them. Communications between artists, and between artists and their audience are a necessary factor in this. The role of the arts as a public undertaking means that the audience must be included and engaged in any discussion of the nature of this participation. As a result, AIN will utilise public performances, post-performance feedback/discussion, and web-based discussion fora as means of ensuring the research enters the 'real world' beyond its immediate confines. \n\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This performance curated by Profs Bannerman and Xu, represented key artistic works from the research project and presented them in China's most prestigious venue performed by the dancers of the Beijing Dance Academy Company.

ArtsCross International Network: the cosmopolitan presence 
in transcultural performance practices

AHRC International Research Network Award

Project Description
The ArtsCross International Network (AIN) developed from an innovative and successful collaboration in 2009 between ResCen and the Beijing Dance Academy (BDA), China entitled Danscross: dancing in a shaking world. The project brought together artists who created short works to a specific brief and academics who observed the process and performances. In 2011 the ArtsCross partnership was extended to include Taipei National University of the Arts (TNUA), Queen Mary, University of London and University of Exeter, as well as UK arts partners Step Out Arts and in 2013, The Place and the Confucius Institute, Goldsmiths College. 
Although the primary focus was on dance, the initiative also considered wider forms and ecologies of performance, and drew on interdisciplinary perspectives to consider creative and performance practices. The UK academics were also familiar with, and sympathetic to, the emergence of new relationships between artistic practice and research, and artists themselves were considered as potential contributors to the body of knowledge that makes up the field.
The ArtsCross International Network was designed to:

? enhance the prospects of stronger, more productive debate between East and West at a strategically critical moment
? harness the transformative power of the arts and art-making to assist productive exchange
? further intercultural dialogue and understanding beyond the performing arts
? develop professional, personal and institutional exchange.

The AHRC International Network award enabled the leveraging of significant additional support from the TAL Foundation allowing the ArtsCross International Network (AIN) to bring together artists, arts professionals and academics as part of the investigation into developments in performance practices. Our discussions focused on the ways in which performance practices reflect changing geo-political and cultural realities, specifically the growing importance of 'East Asia' in the global arena. AIN proposed that an increasingly cosmopolitan perspective was necessary in order to destabilise past perceptions of an irretrievable difference epitomised by the concept of an 'east-west divide' often seen as tradition (East), versus modernity (West), in the performing arts. 

The Network, in contrast to this view of a fundamental divide, explored the emergence of multiple, parallel, modernities as evidenced in and through arts practices and performances, which were posited as representing events in a larger sphere. A forum for exchange and dissemination was developed including weblogs, academic seminars and conferences, discussions in performance venues for arts audiences and interested members of the general public, and demonstrations of practical performance work accompanied by academic discussion and artist/academic exchange. This range and the associated use of websites and social media were designed to reach as wide an audience as possible. See www.rescen.net for further information.


Description

The project was centred around three creative periods (Taipei 2011, Beijing 2012, London 2013) involving artists creating short works to a specific brief designed to enhance the research context for the practice, with academics and arts professionals (critics, venue managers, producers) who observed, discussed and blogged in response to the issues that arose. The inclusive nature of the project allowed the discussion of a range of topics including: 

? the politics and practice of curation and observation
? training techniques and rehearsal strategies
? the creative potential of inter/transcultural practices and performances
? performance analysis and the contingent interpretations and translations, in practical and philosophical terms
? creative and aesthetic perspectives and their foundational contexts
? contemporary histories and cultural policies

Dialogue continued between creative periods and academics gathered for conference presentations and seminars and produced journal articles. A dedicated edition of the Routledge journal Choreographic Practices is due for publication in 2015.


Challenges

The scope and ambition of the project was made clear when academics from Taipei and Beijing requested a session specifically allocated to 'catching-up' on fifty years of separation. That session was itself illuminating, but the process of 'catching-up' continued throughout the workshops, a process that included acknowledging and rectifying a deficit in Western understanding of the East Asian history and context.

Faced with the reality of culturally contingent practices, vocabularies and understandings, the anchor of the exchanges between artists in the studio became invaluable. These reference points allowed the beginning of a 'glossary' of performance and cultural terminologies, which included Chinese contemporary dance, body centring/centres of gravity, concepts of 'classical' and the mutability of tradition, as well as often frank exchanges about the politics of performance. The grounded nature of the studio practice also allowed, and sometimes insisted, that discussions and judgements were 'held', not in a frozen sense, but to allow a slower dynamic of consideration and reconsideration to take place before a new exchange began.

These discussions, and the associated performance observations, required patience, stamina and an open, intellectual curiosity that is not easy to maintain in such an intense working environment. The challenge of this context was part of the project design, intending to move the exchange beyond the short-term engagement of a conference or arts festival, so that working together became a daily occurrence, a routine and a practice. However, it was at times more intense than had been imagined and fatigue, both a barrier and facilitator of understanding, was a feature of the workshops.

The Core Events

ArtsCross Taipei 2011: Uncertainwaiting 
The ArtsCross Taipei blog is at: http://rescen.net/blog2/
The first of the three editions was supported only by the TAL Foundation and from TNUA funding as the AHRC funding came on stream later, in March 2012, and in any case could not stretch across the three years required for each city to host a performance and workshop event. The symmetry of each city acting as host met the Confucian sensibilities of equitability and reciprocity in the fulfilment of 'host' and 'guest' roles, but it also allowed a deeper understanding of each perspective as it could be seen in its home context. 
It provided a stimulating and inspiring start with the staff, facilities and students of TNUA allowing the project to gel and lively discussions to take place. The reality of performance was brought home by the presence of the audience and the engagement with significant arts figures such as Lin Hwai Min, Artistic Director of Cloud Gate Dance Theatre and Alistair Spalding CEO and Artistic Director of Sadler's Wells Theatre, London. 
The academic research team was constrained by the short time available for preparation, but we were able to achieve a team of twenty academics with participation from each partner and to begin to explore the themes that would become the focus of the Network. 
We began with questions such as: 
? Are the arts of East and West as separate as they might sometimes seem?
? In a shifting world, what can different practices of artmaking and criticism say to one another across the linguistic, cultural, geopolitical, and geographical distances which might lie between them?
? Performance is always a collaborative process - between artists for example, or between artists and their audiences.
? How might this collaboration be extended across cultures, and across the differing sorts of participants involved?

ArtsCross Beijing 2012: Light and Water

The ArtsCross Beijing blog is at: http://rescen.net/blog4/

With the benefit of the Taipei experiences and the subsequent online discussions and exchanges we focused more narrowly in Beijing on questions arising from the process of understanding each other and the practices and products of the artists. The role of language, always an issue in the particular context of a non-verbal art form with its own specialist vocabularies of practice, was foregrounded and the key role for translation and interpretation in our work. 

We were able to involve a team of postgraduate student from the BDA and 5 postgraduate students from Beijing's Foreign Language and Culture University (FLCU) whose studies were focused on Interpretation and/or translation and on theories of translation. 

Before arriving in Beijing we discussed the theme set for the artists and the focus for our workshop dialogues, eventually articulating the theme as:
On Exchange: translation and interpretation in practice, process and performance
As markers for our discussions we noted that:
? ArtsCross begins with words, which become movement, and with our discussions returns to words

? we interpret and translate between the cultures we represent and observe mediated by location, discipline, scale, language etc....

? we interpret and translate the studio and its practices and processes into the theatre and performance

? we are involved in a process in which artists and scholars interpret and translate each other and their work

This proved to be more than enough to spark lively debates made all the more relevant by the studio practice, and the context of the BDA where students were going about their daily training rituals and the fact that we were in Beijing, for some TNUA colleagues, for the first time.

There were ten choreographers, twenty-seven performers, twenty-four academics, dance writer Donald Hutera, ResCen artist Richard Layzell, UK arts partners Eddie Nixon, Director, Theatre and Artist Development, The Place (UK) and Jih-Wen Yeh, Artistic Director/Producer Step Out Arts (UK) and UK documentors Andrew Lang and Nigel Boardman.


ArtsCross London 2013: Leaving home: being elsewhere

The ArtsCross London blog is at: http://rescen.net/blog5/
This edition of ArtsCross involved strengthening existing partnerships with Beijing Dance Academy, Taipei National University of the Arts, Queen Mary, University of London, University of Exeter, Step Out Arts and The Place, and saw the addition of a new partner, the Confucius Institute, Goldsmiths College, London.
In London, the choreographers faced similar demands as those in other editions: to create work that is contained within a ten-minute performance allocation, to address the theme, to use up to six performers from the three geographical locations. The last stipulation involved working with interpreters and with performers whose training in and understanding of performance varied widely - and this was more acute in London than previously as we were able to include more performers from the West.
The academics similarly were offered themes so that their endeavours and their 'process thoughts' were discussed and revealed through the online blog. The over-arching themes were crossing art forms, crossing disciplines and crossing languages and we also shared our thoughts on appropriate and sometimes innovative methods/methodologies that are effective and productive. We did so within the frame of the question: what research methods/methodologies are available to us, as academics, to investigate and understand the immediate activities we are observing and our field in general?
The fact that every academic involved had personal experience of performance practice emerged as a significant aspect of our discussions and the ways we regarded, utilised our corporeal, experiential understandings in our observations. The project as a whole combined the investigations of creative artists who are active in the arts marketplace with the debates of academic observers for whom performance is a practical as well as an intellectual endeavour. For this final edition of this series we also raised our field of vision to consider some meta-questions such as: 
? what are the political, cultural and aesthetic implications of these cross-border movements? 
? what sort of challenges do they present to artists and audiences, and to policy makers? 
? do they invite us to do things differently at home, as well as elsewhere? 
What research methods/methodologies are available to us, as academics, to investigate and understand the immediate activities we are observing and our field in general?
The performances were followed by a conference at Queen Mary, University of London with Co-Investigator Martin Welton playing a key role in the organisation of the event.

Conclusion
The text prepared for the conference also served as a useful summary of some of what was involved in the ArtsCross International Network, although one of the major benefits of this AHRC award was the licence to allow vibrant discussions to flow, eddy and coalesce around questions and concerns as they arose from the groundedness of the project. 
One of the most significant aspects of the ArtsCross project to date has been the extent to which it has given grounds for reflection on presumptions and dispositions in the language, culture and practice of 'home', as much as it has drawn attention to similarities or differences in experiences of elsewhere. 
The project has reached a wide and diverse audience through the modes of performance, weblogs, social media, conferences and publications, It has also also invited scholarly reflection on processes of making and producing transnational performance, rather than privileging what is expressed in its public presentation. The various styles and approaches to performance which fall under the umbrella of 'modern' or 'contemporary' dance have been a particularly important focus for this enquiry, raising questions about alternate and more cosmopolitan modernities elsewhere, and the efficacy, or otherwise, of our home languages in speaking for our experiences and enabling understanding of the experiences of others.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Developing further intercultural projects noting and building on the range of cultural activities developed in ArtsCross so that the processes and products of cultural exchange produce maximum social and cultural benefit.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3BCE266-E157-42A1-8D1A-B3F1CE692969</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.rescen.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CD7F8767-F666-4F39-A4D9-E14D724F1E0A"><gtr:id>CD7F8767-F666-4F39-A4D9-E14D724F1E0A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-defining the 'contact zone': Translation, transformation and the space in-between</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Choreographic Practices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9d30989cd54d4a0ed48c1817de69b0b0"><gtr:id>9d30989cd54d4a0ed48c1817de69b0b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loukes R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5CC450C-939F-45EB-ABBA-20B6E6486EF0"><gtr:id>D5CC450C-939F-45EB-ABBA-20B6E6486EF0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mask - ArtsCross/Danscross London</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Choreographic Practices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/491ea915043e1da25225dfb970bef79a"><gtr:id>491ea915043e1da25225dfb970bef79a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lei G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/68B04C0D-2484-4F82-B863-3F576A12B64C"><gtr:id>68B04C0D-2484-4F82-B863-3F576A12B64C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Collaboration in Performance Practice - Premises, Workings and Failures [working title]</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Productive misapprehensions- Artscross as a cross-cultural collaborative zone of contestation of dance practice [working title]</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a449fbce840a448cc509966f850c1b07"><gtr:id>a449fbce840a448cc509966f850c1b07</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sachsenmaier, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/564AF8CE-F626-4B87-B948-610D7275082C"><gtr:id>564AF8CE-F626-4B87-B948-610D7275082C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Journal of Beijing Dance Academy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>View of Postmodern Cultural Differences of Ages and Cultural Reality in Chinese Dance Creation from Artscross/Dancecross</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b5f25c2418844fc51838b05cd5672981"><gtr:id>b5f25c2418844fc51838b05cd5672981</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xu, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/22D50877-F03E-478E-91B7-195DB6389177"><gtr:id>22D50877-F03E-478E-91B7-195DB6389177</gtr:id><gtr:title>Depart: A journey of Light and Water</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Choreographic Practices</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1b389d87fc545b3a5e0ff3650a4760fa"><gtr:id>1b389d87fc545b3a5e0ff3650a4760fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Yi-San W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B932CA4C-DB71-472D-983E-F2326CB2E9A4"><gtr:id>B932CA4C-DB71-472D-983E-F2326CB2E9A4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Journal of Beijing Dance Academy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Some Thoughts on What Danscross &quot;Light &amp;
