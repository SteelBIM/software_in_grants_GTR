The platform provides a model in which different mechanisms of knowledge, people and data exchange are piloted in four thematic areas of policing: partnerships; acquisitive crimes of burglary and shoplifting; community engagement and public order. The approach is driven by a combination of interdisciplinary research excellence, innovations in knowledge exchange and lasting impact on both policing and academic partners. It will seek to change the ways in which the police use evidence and insights from research as well as the ways in which researchers frame research questions and engage with policing professionals across the life-course of research. The platform will provide a two-way exchange, learning opportunities and data exploitation that embed the PCC's strategic priorities of 'innovation, income and investment'. It will seek to foster a greater appreciation among police officers for the relevance, role and value of research evidence in informing police practice, as well as a greater awareness of research methodologies and skills within the police organisation. At the same time, it will seek to foster greater understanding of the operational police challenges and encourage responsibility amongst researchers for helping shape evidence-based responses to these. In so doing, it will build an academic culture of engagement and a commitment to co-production.
The four hubs will focus on: (i) the role of partnerships in promoting organisational change and the manner in which this can be analysed through co-produced research; (ii) the exploitation of large police datasets to explain and better understand the spatial and social distribution of the acquisitive crimes of burglaries and shoplifting; (iii) the evaluation of an innovative community engagement project; and (iv) public order training and the evaluation of the impact of training on police practice. Each hub will benefit from one academic research lead and one nominated police lead seconded from WYP. WYP will contribute staff time, venues and resources associated with the preparation of significant datasets (including 10 years of burglary and shoplifting data across West Yorkshire).
This new collaboration will develop innovative ways to address the challenges faced by the police and will provide for: collaborative framing of the research questions from the outset; the two-way flow of knowledge and data; mutual engagement with research programmes from their inception to dissemination; joint ownership of research and its outcomes or products; enhanced research impact on policy and practice through collaboration on projects that are directly relevant to police managers; the production of an evidence-base for policy and practice, and to enable innovation; the exploitation of knowledge exchange including training opportunities; opportunities for the development of research expertise and capacity among police officers and staff; and the development of skills within policing to get research evidence used over the longer-term.
The work of the project will be overseen by a Steering Group including members of the WYP senior command team and chaired by the PCC, which will meet bi-monthly. Each of the thematic hubs will produce accessible policy briefings outlining the findings as will the programme as a whole. Whilst the initial activity is focused on West Yorkshire, it is intended that benefits will attend to the region (via the N8 Policing Research Partnership) as well as national and international debate and practice. This wider dissemination will be overseen and promoted by an Advisory Board with members drawn from the College of Policing, ACPO, What Works Centre for Crime Reduction and N8.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit: The non-academic beneficiaries of the programme of activities designed under this Knowledge Exchange platform include, first and foremost, West Yorkshire Police, the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner PCC for West Yorkshire and their partner organisations. This proposal arises out of a series of discussions that have been held with Chief Constable Mark Gilmore, Deputy Chief Constable Dee Collins, Assistant Chief Constable Geoff Dodd, the Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson and his Chief Executive, Fraser Sampson about the ways in which the University of Leeds can work collaboratively in strategic and structured ways with West Yorkshire Police (WYP) to explore innovative forms of knowledge exchange and research co-production to mutual benefit and to ensure that policing is increasingly evidence-lead. Along with others senior and operational police colleagues the above will oversee the programme of activities (via the proposed Steering Group) and ensure that full benefits to WYP and partners are derived from it. It is intended that the citizens of West Yorkshire will benefit from improvements to policing and police-public encounters in the targeted areas of public order policing, burglary and shoplifting, partnership working and community engagement. Secondly, wider police beneficiaries will include the forces in the north of England that are engage in the work of the N8 Policing Research Partnership. This proposal also benefits from and will feed into the wider work of the N8PRP. It is anticipated that lessons learnt, research findings and the value of models of knowledge exchange piloted will be rolled out and replicated across the wider N8 region. Thirdly, it is anticipated that the work will impact on the national debate about appropriate models of collaborations between police, PCCs and universities and this will be channelled via the College of Policing and the What Works Centre for Crime Prevention. Fourthly, the outcomes of the activities associated with the proposal will be disseminated beyond England and Wales via international networks (such as the Centre for Excellence in Policing and Security in Australia). 
How will they benefit: This project has involved non-academic beneficiaries and users from the outset in the development stages of the proposal design. The focus of the thematic hubs and the ambitions of the platform as a whole were agreed and designed in collaboration with senior staff within WYP. Subsequently, WYP will benefit from direct involvement in shaping and contributing to the programme of activities and the outcomes in a way that will engender their ownership of the findings. The proposal gives WYP an opportunity to explore different models of knowledge exchange and pilot research co-production in ways that will bring value to the organisation by equipping police staff with greater understanding of insights from research and the ways in which policing practices might become more informed by research evidence. The potential for impact is considerable within WYP given the large number of police staff who will be directly involved in the activities and the manner in which senior police commanders and managers will oversee the programme. The potential for impact beyond West Yorkshire, given the close synergies with the N8PRP and the College of Policing, is also significant and will be exploited to the full (overseen by a national Advisory Board). The project will culminate in a final conference to which key national figures will be invited and at which the policy briefings will be published. These key findings documents will be written in an accessible format for wide dissemination among non-academic beneficiaries and made publicly available online. To engage the wider policing community and disseminate the lessons learnt and research findings, at least two articles will be published in professional police journals.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire (WYPCC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Professor Crawford invited to join West Yorkshire Police's Independent Advisory Board in support of its Innovation Strategy and Joint Innovation Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>9EE518D8-F007-4A63-9D95-05BA89F48493</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not to date</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Information and advice</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Professor Crawford sits on the Independent Advisory Board in support of the Joint Innovation Group</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire (WYPCC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>N8 Policing Research Partnership - West Yorkshire</gtr:description><gtr:id>32B16EA6-D01F-4C30-963B-875A6E8FF6C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too many to mention - all are outlined in the linked URL</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Contribution to the Steering Group of the N8 PRP and to activities within the programme.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration in a programme of activities supported by a Catalyst Grant (HEFCE) form 2015-2020 (one of 11 police forces and PCC Offices to do so).

It directly led to and prompted a subsequent meeting with senior West Yorkshire Police colleagues to discuss the implementation of the key findings and follow on strategy in police-university relations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>keynote/invited speaker</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/events/2015/research-collaborations-evidenced-based-policing</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>3000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Catalyst Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>14DD454A-FBFF-4ED7-8C36-FE7CFCBBB18D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>336829</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Police Knowledge Fund</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>College of Policing</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>2E331851-EDCE-431F-8A57-85316FB32477</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>1.

2. They have informed the appreciation and recognition of the value of research and knowledge for policing among senior officers within West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the PCC.
3. They have led to structural change in the organisation of relations between the OPCC and West Yorkshire Police force, which established a Joint Innovation Forum to ensure research and innovation is coordinated and evidence-based practices are fostered across both organisations.
4. They have informed a large scale HEFCE funded research co-production and knowledge exchange platform funded via Catalyst Fund for five years 2015-2020 in a collaboration between the N8 universities and 11 police forces together with other partners in the north of England -see: http://www.hefce.ac.uk/funding/catalyst/projects/leeds/
This N8 Policing Research Partnership was build on the lessons from the ESRC KEOS pilot.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>58677D7A-6B19-401D-82CF-C2A0C2E4812E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The pilot project provided important lessons about the process of research collaboration - its organisation, dynamics and delivery - between university researchers and policing partners, as well as generating new co-produced research evidence. The challenges of and possibilities for models of research co-production between university researchers and policing partners have been tested and explored and as a consequence are now better understood.
1. The project demonstrated both the feasibility and value of transforming the nature of police-university relations and 'doing things differently' through structured collaboration. This provided policing partners with a sense of ownership over the co-produced research, including the development of the research ideas and how the research findings might be implemented. The engagement of police partners from the outset influenced the selection of policing issues to be researched, and had a bearing on the conduct of the research for example choice of case studies. Collaboration also gave policing partners a stake in the implementation and delivery of the lessons learnt and project outcomes. Collaboration also challenged researchers to work in different ways that accommodate the needs, priorities and working constraints of policing partners.
2. The project enabled the findings of existing (ESRC funded) research - notably in relation to public order policing - to achieve greater impact and prominence within local policing policies and professional practices. The project also demonstrated the additional value that can be derived from the greater use and analysis of existing data within organisations like the police.
3. The challenges and importance of community engagement by the police and involving non-police partners was illustrated by the research. Done well, 'community engagement' can foster constructive dialogue, mutually beneficial and collaborative relations between police and citizens and communities to identify and tackle local issues of crime, disorder and neighbourhood safety.
4. The research on policing partnerships highlighted the vital importance of inter-organisational relations in delivering public safety outcomes. The research highlighted a number of factors that are significant in enabling successful partnership relations, including: the existence of trust relations between partners; ensuring partnership relations are embedded in frontline practice; that co-located and multi-agency teams can be an effective mechanism for productive, transformative working; and the important role of training in multi-agency relations and working dynamics, including for frontline staff. The conclusions from the research into policing partnerships were that:
?Contemporary policing by necessity is embedded in and dependent on a complex constellation of inter-agency partnerships.
?As well as enabling the coordination and pooling of expertise, information and resources, partnerships can provide valuable opportunities for innovation and learning whilst simultaneously challenging introspective organisational cultures. 
?Effective partnerships allow for problem-oriented approaches to flourish and for the development of problem-solving capacity and skills to come to the fore and to be appreciated. 
? For the police, partnerships offer prospects to deliver the necessary organisational change to underpin any sustained shift in resources, priorities and commitment to a greater emphasis on prevention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The opportunities for closer police-university collaboration and the potential benefits in terms of evidence-based practice and knowledge informed policing have been realised and demonstrated by this knowledge exchange project. The programme of work was designed with the aim of achieving far reaching impact on policy and professional practice realised through the exploitation of knowledge exchange and training opportunities. The research outcomes will be taken forward in a number of ways:
?An end of project conference (29th September 2015) enabled the research findings to be communicated to a diverse audience of academics, police partners and other interested parties including the College of Policing, HMIC and Home Office. As a consequence, the outcomes may inform developments nationally over the forthcoming years.
?West Yorkshire Police and Office of the PCC will use the findings to inform future policing strategy, policy and practice. Senior officers from police partners attended an end of project meeting to discuss both the research findings and their implications for the police, and how the university might continue to support the force in the future.
?This pilot collaboration between one police force and PCC (West Yorkshire) directly informed a HEFCE Catalyst Fund bid submitted by the N8 Policing Research Partnership and lead by the University of Leeds team involved in the KEOS project. A grant of &amp;pound;3 million was awarded by HEFCE in 2015 with a further &amp;pound;4.2 million matched funding from N8 universities and policing partners. led on the development of a successful bid to HEFCE for a new five year programme of research co-production and knowledge exchange (2015-2020) 'Innovation and the Application of Knowledge for More Effective Policing'. The models of engagement and knowledge exchange between the University of Leeds and WYP/OPCCWY will inform the wider workings and activities of the N8 partnership. Consequently, the project finding are being taken forward and developed by the N8 Policing Research Partnership - www.n8prp.org.uk - a partnership of 8 universities, 11 police forces and Offices of Police and Crime Commissioners and other policing partners. The project is supported by an International Advisory Board which draws upon key stakeholders that had been engaged initially through the ESRC KEOS project. This wide-ranging programme of research coproduction and knowledge exchange is exerting growing impact on the policing sector in diverse ways including data exploitation, new collaborative research projects, training and learning, policing innovation, knowledge exchange fellowships and collaborative PhD studentships.
?The College of Policing through the Police Knowledge Fund (2015-17: http://whatworks.college.police.uk/Involve/Pages/Knowledge-Fund.aspx) is supporting a number new police-university collaborations that will benefit considerably from the project findings. These include the Better Policing Collaborative (lead by the University of Nottingham), East Midlands Policing Academic Collaboration (EMPAC - for which Professor Crawford has been invited to be an advisor - lead by the University of Northampton), and a project on 'Developing Restorative Policing that Professor Crawford is a co-Investigator on with Professor Shapland from Sheffield University.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D6C67A60-8AA6-469D-A6BA-01A10085A5E2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.law.leeds.ac.uk/research/projects/an-exploratory-knowledge-platform-for-policing</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Reorganisation of West Yorkshire Police's Strategic Management of Research Evidence - What Works - and Innovation Strategy via the establishment of a Joint Innovation Group and Independent Advisory Board</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8349FFAF-844C-47FA-8712-35A17F78CD24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Better coordination of strategies within and between West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire as well as the better use of research evidence on the basis of the reorganisation of West Yorkshire Police's Strategic Management of Research Evidence - What Works - and Innovation Strategy. The joint Innovation Strategy for West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire aims to transform policing and community safety in West Yorkshire by encouraging, developing and delivering innovations, contributing to the delivery of the priorities and outcomes of the Police and Crime Plan 2013-2018. The strategy serves to build an evidence-based and 'what works' approach to policing and community safety in West Yorkshire, ensuring research is brought to operational reality, being implemented to realise the full potential of innovations. The strategy will also seek to identify, action and invest in short, medium and longer-term strategic research requirements of West Yorkshire Police and the Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire, creating a Programme of Innovation, serving to bridge identified gaps in capability, knowledge, understanding and expertise.
This reorganisation is directly linked to the experiences, findings and outcomes of the Knowledge Exchange Opportunities Scheme pilot and the discussions that ensued.
To deliver the strategy, a Joint Innovation Group (JIG) was established in early 2016 which shall meet every 6 weeks. The JIG will be co- chaired by ACC Andy Battle and Fraser Sampson, the PCC Chief Executive (both of whom sat on the Steering Group of the ESRC KEOS project) and has the following members, all of whom are Chief Superintendent and above:
? Head of West Yorkshire for Innovation
? Head of Force Performance Improvement Unit
? Head of Programme of Change
? Head of Organisational Learning
? Head of Information Technology
? Head of Strategy &amp;amp; Policy Unit
? Head of Performance Review
? Head of Risk &amp;amp; Insurance
? Treasurer
To support, guide and advise the JIG, an Independent Advisory Board (IAB) has been created. Professor Crawford has been invited to sit on the Board.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory
