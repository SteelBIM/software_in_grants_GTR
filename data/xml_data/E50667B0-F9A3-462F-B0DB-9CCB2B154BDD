Southampton to demonstrate a new rechargeable battery technology capable of achieving high cycle life at competitive
costs to target the microgrid energy storage market. The project will exploit OXIS Energy's core Lithium Sulfur technology
using a new electrolyte classification to extend cycle life. The University of Southampton will exploit their extensive
knowledge of novel electrochemical test techniques to assess candidate electrolyte formulations and then test their
performance credentials in the laboratory. These new electrolytes will be then scaled up by OXIS and their full performance
characterised in a prototype Li-S battery cells. The project will demonstrate the commercial feasibility of this new
rechargeable battery technology for stationary energy storage. If successful developed this technology will reduce
consumer costs and carbon emissions whilst improving the Uk's energy security by being less reliant on foreign imports of
fossil fuels.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims to develop a new lithium-sulphur battery rechargeable battery technology that will be specially well suited
for microgrid energy storage. This will allow a more efficient use of energy: the excess of energy produced by micro-scale
renewables will be stored and used when required. This approach has many advantages for the society. The cost of
electricity will decrease, the energy security will increase due to a lower dependency on fossil fuels and CO2 emissions will
decrease due to an increased use of renewable sources of energy.
The approach taken in this project is to apply the concept of solvent in salt electrolytes in lithium-sulphur batteries. Lithiumsulphur
batteries have many unique advantages. Especially relevant for microgrid energy storage is the fact that lithiumsulphur
batteries are cheap and exhibit a long cycle life. Major improvements in battery performance will be sought in this
project by developing new electrolytes based on the solvent in salt concept, where the amount of solvent that is used in the
battery can be minimized. This produces an obvious decrease in the cost of the batteries. Safety standards are also
significantly improved with this approach due to the higher cycling stability of the lithium negative electrode.
This novel approach could also be highly beneficial in other energy storage systems, such as lithium-metal, lithium-ion and
lithium-air batteries. It is also likely that these new electrolytes could lead to improved electrocatalysis (e.g. improved
synthetic reactions) in the more general context of electrochemistry in organic electrolytes.
In addition to the general benefits to the society, this project will underpin the research development of Oxis and
Southampton. Oxis will strengthen its position in the rechargeable battery market and will attack further interest and
investment in this novel energy technology. Southampton will gain scientific reputation and expand the research output via
high impact publications, patents, participation in conferences, etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>97590</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed new methods to characterize the basic components of lithium-sulfur batteries.
