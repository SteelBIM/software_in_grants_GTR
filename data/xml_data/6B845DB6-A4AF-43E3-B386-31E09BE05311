Without major advances in production, food shortages will become more frequent across the globe, including developed parts of the world. It is therefore essential that we ensure sufficient food is available, in other words to establish &amp;quot;global food security&amp;quot;. The world population currently stands at 7 billion but is predicted to increase to 9 billion by 2050. This is a major threat to food security, but there are also other exacerbating pressures. There is a need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming and climate change, while land and crops are being increasingly used to produce alternative energy sources to fossil fuels (coal, gas and oil). This leads to competition for land, water, energy and the sources of food themselves. To produce more food requires either more land (which isn't available) or an improvement in the efficiency of production. Increases in personal wealth in developing countries is predicted to increase the demand for meat and animal products, which consumers associate with a higher quality diet and social status. However, meat requires significantly more resource to produce than other foods. Meat producing animals, such as pigs and poultry, commonly require grain-based feeds which will become an increasingly limited resource, due to competition from human diets and the biofuels industry. These pressures make it important to reduce the quantity of feed required per unit meat produced, thereby improving &amp;quot;feed efficiency&amp;quot;. To do this, use of technologies will be required including those not currently deemed acceptable to the consumer (in the EU at least), although threats to food security may change consumers values and ethical stances.

For efficient production of meat, the goal is to maximize the deposition of nutrients (particularly protein) into skeletal muscle and repartition nutrients (particularly those for energy) away from fat. The liver is critical as it processes nutrients and plays a major role in coordinating whole body protein and energy metabolism. Animal growth promoters are used legally in some countries (Australia, Brazil and USA), but not the EU, and have the effect of increasing lean while decreasing body fat. The objective of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which these agents affect these tissues. Pigs will be given either a beta agonist (BA) or growth hormone (GH), and compared to a control group over a time course (28 days) during which these agents are known to increase feed efficiency. Skeletal muscle, liver and fat tissues will be collected at 5 fixed time points (1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days). Three of these time points will be subsequently selected for more &amp;quot;in-depth&amp;quot; measurements, based on the growth data and expression of some key genes. Using a technique called &amp;quot;deep sequencing&amp;quot; all the genes expressed in these 3 tissues at these 3 timepoints will be identified along with other genetic material called microRNA, which is involved in determining which proteins are produced. Deep sequencing produces a large quantity of information, which will identify the genes and microRNAs produced by these pig tissues; information which by itself will enhance our understanding. Secondly, by comparison between the treatment groups, those genes and microRNAs influenced by the growth promoters will be identified. Finally, the relationships and interactions (so called networks) between the expressed genes and tissues will be identified, to determine common processes influenced by these growth promoters. The expectation is that specific &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; genes and processes (i.e. networks) will be identified in these tissues, which could be manipulated in the future to enhance the efficiency of animal growth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Global Food Security is becoming an increasingly important issue. The increasing competition for land and crops for human consumption with their use for animal feed and biofuels industries, mean strategies to improve animal feed efficiency are urgently needed. This will require use of new or existing technologies, including those currently deemed unacceptable by consumers (in the EU at least). Animal growth promoters (beta-agonists (BA) and growth hormone (GH)), currently used commercially in some countries (Australia, Brazil and USA), improve feed efficiency, increase lean and decrease fat deposition. This project will determine the time course (1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 days) for the effects of Ractopamine (BA) and Reporcin (GH) on finisher pigs, including their effects on muscle, fat and liver transcriptomes using deep sequencing (HiSeq Illumina sequencing platform) and subsequent pathway and network analysis (e.g. IPA, SolCyc, ANN). This will generate a large quantity of sequence information, which will be used to identify the genes and microRNAs expressed in these pig tissues. Then, by comparison between the treatment groups, those genes and microRNAs involved in the growth response, together with the key pathways, gene networks and interactions between genes and tissues will be identified. Verification of key mRNA and microRNAs will be carried out by qRT-PCR (Roche Lightcycler 480), using SYBR green and Taqman small RNA detection probes (Applied Biosystems). The expectation is that specific &amp;quot;key&amp;quot; nodes within the networks will be identified, which could be manipulated in the future to enhance the efficiency of animal growth.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed pig time course trial will be the most comprehensive study ever performed to investigate the mechanisms for how these growth promoters work. It is extremely costly and therefore very unlikely to be repeated anywhere else in the world. The fact Pfizer have chosen to fund this work at Nottingham is testimony to the calibre of the staff and facilities available. The results and subsequent publications are therefore likely to have a high impact and to be highly cited in years to come, thereby benefiting both academic and industry scientists. Ultimately, the main benefit will be an academic one with the studies leading to a comprehensive understanding of how tissues interact to regulate growth and metabolism, information which may then be developed into a better understanding of other species, including man.

In addition, the deep sequencing data will be made freely available via online databases, which will be accessible by other researchers and therefore provide a complementary resource to the pig genome project which is still on-going. Hence a wide variety of pig researchers will benefit in terms of both published information and tissue transcriptome sequence data, but the information may also be translated for the benefit of human medicine (e.g. use of pigs as models for human health).

The overall aim is that this comprehensive in-depth study into the changes in tissue transcriptome at different times following administration of these potent growth promoters, will identify key networks and nodes that can then be targeted for drug development to enhance pig growth and feed efficiency. Our industrial partners, Pfizer, will benefit from this important step in the drug discovery process, but will then need to invest further in terms of patents and further studies before any resulting product would reach the market and be commercially available for use. However, were this to eventually reach fruition, we would all benefit via a small but significant improvement in food security.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>294492</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Zoetis Animal Health</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Zoetis collaborative partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>20E62E81-D7E1-4287-B01E-89DA24C3BE51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our work has identified specific genes and associated signalling pathways which appear to be an integral part of the growth response to the anabolic agents.

The initial approach is a proof-of-principle analysis of gene products which will then enable more specific gene products to be identified which could be developed as so-called drugable targets. Our work is still ongoing and it is hoped that other gene targets will be identified which are direct involved in enhanced muscle growth and improved feed utilisation efficiency.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Costs for pig trial

However Zoetis did still support a BBSRC LINK proposal which was successfully funded in June 2014, BB/M001385/1: Novel targets for increased muscle growth or feed efficiency.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>98000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC FLexible Interchange Programme (FLIP)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M017524/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>037B8D12-87C0-42A5-AB2B-9741B9503E96</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>803630</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>BBSRC-LINK project</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/M001385/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>550ACC4B-57AF-44A1-AF38-0BA8A5A7F56C</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The overall objective of this proposal was to determine the mechanisms by which anabolic agents enhance feed efficiency and lean tissue deposition in pigs, through an examination of their effects on coordinated changes in gene expression across skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. 
Our work has identified specific genes some of which are associated signaling pathways that appear to be an integral part of the growth response to the anabolic agents, whilst others are novel genes which have not been previous reported as being associated with muscle growth. This latter category includes gene products that are involved in intermediate energy metabolism. From this research we have identified a number of gene products are which are associated in enhanced muscle growth in pigs. Our pharmaceutical industry collaborators (Zoetis) are currently investigating these gene products as potential targets that could be manipulated to enhance efficient pig growth. Our industry partners have further extending their research funding which has enabled us to successfully gain a BBSRC-Zoetis LINK grant (BB/M001385/1) which is currently carrying out &amp;quot;proof-of-principle&amp;quot; analysis of gene products. This will then enable those specific gene products that directly affect muscle growth to be identified, which then could subsequently be developed as so-called &amp;quot;drugable&amp;quot; targets. 
In addition our research work has discovering some of the fundamental molecular mechanisms that appear to be responsible for muscle hypertrophy. Through presentation and publication of our findings we are currently disseminating our research to the general scientific community, especially those involved the health implications of the loss of muscle mass.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>01B32FBA-2786-4230-9752-EAB9CAC3DA19</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The overall objective of this proposal was to determine the mechanisms by which anabolic agents enhance feed efficiency and lean tissue deposition in pigs, through an examination of their effects on coordinated changes in gene expression across skeletal muscle, adipose tissue and liver. This information was to be utilized to identify the potential novel mechanisms by which the efficiency of lean tissue growth can be enhanced.
A pig trial examined the effects of anabolic agents (the growth promoters beta=adrenergic agonists or growth hormone) over a 27 day time course. An examination of gene expression involved a variety of gene expression assessment methodologies. In addition we have applied a variety of data analysis techniques which has included the use of novel mathematics to make an adaptation of computer programs which examine time course data . This approach is distinctly different to the commonly used data analysis procedures, as it is a data-centered time series analysis which identifies and clusters them in groups which have statistically the same profiles. The gene expression data has also informed the design of a mathematical model for the changes in energy related metabolites during stimulated muscle growth thereby allowing the potential prediction effects of manipulating individual metabolites on muscle growth. These approaches have allowed us to identify that induction of muscle hypertrophy by these anabolic agents is associated in some very early co-ordinated changes in gene expression of specific metabolic pathways in muscle but not liver or fat. We have clearly identified that the more effective anabolic agents at causing changes in muscle growth, such as beta-adrenergic agonists, mediate there effects directly at the level of the muscle rather than large systemic or preipheral tissue changes. Less effective anabolic agents such as growth hormone have a more systemic effect causing greater effects on liver gene expression than beta-adrenergic agonists. We have identified that these anabolic agents give clear and co-ordinated changes in mRNA transcriptome but have no consistent effect on microRNAs. A novel aspect of our findings is that the anabolic agents cause an induced capacity for muscle to synthesize specific amino acids, the predominant amino acid being the serine, which is normal considered to not be limiting in normal growth. This activated amino acid synthesis appears to be related to changes in metabolic pathways which are involved in metabolism required for energy production, which is normally associated with muscle contraction. Uniquely we have identified significant increased expression of an isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase which is normally involved in the regeneration of glucose in the liver (gluconeogenesis), which is not expected to occur in muscle. In addition we have identified that anabolic agents which mediate the greatest muscle growth (beta-adrenergic agonists) cause gene expression changes which are associated with activation of processes response to abormal protein synthesis, so called &amp;quot;unfolded protein&amp;quot; stress response. This is a novel finding and suggests that muscle growth utilises un-expected process to allow excentuated growth. The products of these identified genes are currently being investigated in a BBSRC LINK project (BB/MM001385/1) to determine the whether these gene products directly influence muscle growth, as well as our pharmaceutical industry collaborators utilizing this information to identify potential targets for manipulation to increase the efficiency of pig growth.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although this project is identifying the mechanisms by which muscle growth can be increased in production animals, the findings can be translated to inform healthcare research. The reduction of muscle mass, particulalry in aging (sarcopenia), has significant health implications. It is very likley that the genes we identify that are involved in muscle growth are important in processes which could maintain muscle mass in humans, and thereby maintain health.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB6C86D7-CA4C-4F99-9D7E-B1BD58C1FAD5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A web-app has been created allowing users to access RNA-seq data sets by species, tissue and experiment and then interrogate expression levels for groups of genes, by name/ID or gene ontology term.

Although in some respect crude this simple comparison is potentially a way to quickly build and refute hypotheses concerning fundamental patterns in gene expression within and between species. The construction of &amp;quot;RNA-Seeker&amp;quot; web-app has, in part, been facilitated by utilizing the RNA-seq data sets from pig skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue generated from the research carried out in the project BB/J005320/1. This facility allows the exploration of orthologous genes in pigs across these three metabolically important tissues a resource which will be of value to the pig research community.
