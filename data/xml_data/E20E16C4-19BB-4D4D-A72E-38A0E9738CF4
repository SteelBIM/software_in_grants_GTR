Up to now, the fuel cell has been too expensive to apply in such applications. Even after long development, a small fuel cell system for power/heat costs almost &amp;pound;13,000. These high costs are coming down as production increases (about 50,000 units were installed in Japan in 2014) but in the UK less than 100 systems are installed now. By utilizing a new design, Adelan plans to jump onto a lower learning curve to accelerate the penetration of this technology. Adelan published the first description of a UK microtubular SOFC in 1994 and has been making steady progress in cost reduction and in commercialisation strategy. The project partner Conrad Anderson has manufacturing skills which will show how the product can be made economically. The third partner University of Birmingham is an expert organisation in fuel cells, in this case developing sealant and metal interconnect materials. The commercial objective is to manufacture the new design in large numbers by 2020.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main impact will be to get this innovative product to market. The Management Committee aided by CAN will provide RV club feedback to identify different possibilities for using the fuel cell, especially the heat output. The wide reach of the major RV OEM clubs facilitates validation of the Fuel Cell device specifications, and provides an effective approach to making improved fuel cell APUs in the near term, as evidenced, for example, by the rapid proliferation of solar panels on RVs during the last 5 years.

In order to address a comprehensive approach to innovation, and to tailor it to the specific technical, market and organisational issues, the management structure of this project will continuously monitor output and impacts of the project, supported by the project manager and led by the Management Committee. In addition to that internal governance, advisory bodies will be consulted to provide information on usage of the device as it becomes available. This information will be used to adapt the work overview to maximise impact. This builds on previous experience of dissemination in SAPIENS, SAFARI and other projects Adelan has been engaged in.

There is an urgent need at this stage of product development to gain some traction in market terms to ensure technical developments over the last decade retain the momentum to get to market. SMEs do not have the same financial resources as large companies and the long development trajectory of fuel cells means that without a cost sharing, the innovative work would not sustain over a timescale of many years. Innovate UK support will facilitate this work and the results will be tangible to stakeholders, including politicians and policy formers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>20182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P016375/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F95121C7-7C31-40CE-BDBC-1E2BF025AEA6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Energy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC4522D3-ABD6-432A-9268-0F772EA73CB9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fuel Cell Technologies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
