We will do this by combining theoretical work, much of it using high-performance computers, with multi-wavelength observational surveys. We will apply advanced techniques for making numerical predictions, data analysis and modelling, and deploy our skills through a series of international projects.

The research consists of fifteen varied but interconnected projects, each involving one or more faculty members and researchers, that can be collected into three broad themes: Early and late universe cosmology; Galaxy simulation and modelling; Galaxy and cluster observations and analysis. 

In summary:

Early and late universe cosmology: a series of projects will address theoretical predictions and observational constraints on inflation, dark energy and large scale structure. Our work encompasses both the development of theoretical frameworks and the analysis of cutting edge observational datasets (including the Planck satellite, the Dark Energy Survey, the XMM-Newton Cluster Survey (XCS), and the POLARBEAR-2 experiment). 

Galaxy simulation and modelling: we will use Peta-scale computing facilities to carry out detailed studies of the formation and evolution of the first structures, and make statistical predictions that can be used in the exploitation of new and upcoming observational facilities such as JWST, Euclid, LOFAR, ALMA, and SKA.

Galaxy and cluster observations: we will make use of multi-wavelength observations to answer a variety of questions concerning the formation and evolution of galaxies. We will continue to exploit our involvement in HerMES, the Dark Energy Survey, the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey, and XCS. In particular we will develop a new set of advanced tools with which to analyse observations from these projects as well as upcoming facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project brings together scientists studying the early universe and galaxy evolution with the goal of (a) understanding the physics of the first seconds and minutes after the Big Bang when the seeds of today's galaxies formed and (b) following how these seeds grew over 13 billion years and, on even larger scales, assembled into galaxy clusters.
The impact of our research is mainly academic, but we also have a proven track record of sharing the methods/technical expertise developed for it with industry and scientists from other disciplines, and of reaching out to the public to raise interest for our activities and inspire young people for STEM careers.
Based on experience from our current engagement with the non-academic sector, we have identified several opportunities/synergies, which will enable us to both enhance our impact and target new beneficiaries:

Over the next 3 years, the general public will be able to participate in our approx. 50 public engagement events: (1) a series of shows themed 'Sussex Astronomy Centre Presents: The Life of the Cosmos' at the yearly Brighton Science Festival, BSF (audience: ~1000/year); (2) quarterly appearances in pubs/bars/theatres (audience: 50/night) for, e.g. Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique, PubhD, Nerd Nite &amp;amp; Skeptics in the Pub; (3) on-campus events, e.g. public lectures or Star Gazing Live (audience: 100-200/event). From answering basic questions on our place in the Universe to visualizing how galaxies evolve with data/simulations from this project, these activities foster citizen understanding and awareness of scientific advances. For an even wider audience, we will disseminate our research through the blog platform theconversation.com, where Astronomy Centre members have already reached 150,000+ readers just in 2015.
The BSF, where we will participate from 2018-2020, attracts a large number of visitors to the city and is an important factor for the local economy. The modular content of our BSF shows allows us to easily adapt thee to similar events in the region (e.g. Kent Science Festival, Herstmonceux Science Centre Astronomy Festival &amp;amp; SAGAS Summer Convention). We also foresee regular appearances in meetings of local astronomy societies.
The dynamic landscape of startups and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) in the Brighton area will be the focus of our industry engagement. SMEs will be able to tap into a portfolio of Image Processing/Visualization and Data Analysis techniques (branded as 'Out of this World Solutions') we have perfected for our research. SMEs will liaise with 'Out of this World Solutions' at local trade fairs (e.g. Tech66) and through SEPnet. These links will be deepened further through a new PDRA placement scheme, where SMEs will receive first-hand, in-house exposure to our skill set. PDRAs will share insights from their placements with our graduates and contribute another key component to our already diverse capacity-building activities (e.g., training in communication and project management, development of technical skills for high-tech industries).
In the education sector, East/West Sussex school teachers will have access to a range of outreach activities enriching the science education of GCSE or A1-/A2-level students. We provide learning resources (e.g. guided reanalysis of genuine data) for the classroom and host school visits in our department, e.g., the yearly Astronomy Master Class (200+ participants) and the bi-weekly Schools Labs (20-30 pupils/session) with hands-on demonstrations and introductory level research talks on our STFC-funded projects. For these activities we will be able to offer a new/improved series of experiments developed for our BSF shows. These will be an important component in continuing to inspire students for careers in science and maintaining the current physics student recruitment levels at universities nationwide. We also target under-represented groups through the University's established Widening Participation program.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>834303</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P000525/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>615BB43C-305A-47B9-B728-7A9BB0BBE1A4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>45</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - observation</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B43E1E82-2962-4C36-87AD-95AC01BE0A9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>55</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Astronomy - theory</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6EE6184F-4A3C-4A99-A3AC-55FC62120A44</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Computational Methods &amp; Tools</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4EE2392F-9964-4A0B-8C0A-1672FD744F8B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Extra-Galactic Astron.&amp;Cosmol.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
