Information is stored in our brains by alterations in the efficiency of communication at synapses and the MRC Centre is interested in understanding the molecular processes involved in this plasticity. Thus synaptic plasticity is critical for the correct wiring of the brain during development and enables learning and memory to occur throughout life. Pathological alterations in these mechanisms are likely to contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease. We work to understand the processes that underlie these plasticity mechanisms and how they relate to learning and memory.

The MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity is strongly committed to the public understanding of science. Indeed, its Director is a founder member of the European DANA Alliance for the Brain. MRC Centre scientists present public lectures, such as at the British Association, give talks in local schools and at open days, and communicate with the press on topical issues. The MRC Centre will continue to strongly support such activities. Members of the Centre also collaborate closely with Bristol Neuroscience (BN) in their public engagement activities, including providing and manning displays at events such as the biennial ?Science Alive? event (Bristol), Bioscience Kids (Glasgow) and Science in the Gardens (Sheffield). One researcher within the MRC Centre has been made a Fellow of the Researchers in Residence Scheme and is currently doing a placement with a local secondary school.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The purpose of this grant is to enable the renewal of the MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity. The grant provides infrastructural support to facilitate the activities of the membership of the MRC Centre, which currently comprises a total of approximately 100 research scientists led by 21 independent principal investigators. The mission of the MRC Centre is to ?to advance our understanding of synaptic plasticity in a multidisciplinary and collaborative manner. Specifically, studies will be directed at a greater understanding of how, where and why the brain modifies synaptic strength during normal function (in particular, during learning and memory) and in certain pathological states.? The research is highly collaborative and multidisciplinary, and includes molecular biology, chemistry, synaptic physiology, pharmacology, systems level physiology and behaviour.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1637687</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Social Science and Community Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Internal collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>CAF6B25A-9594-4158-AB6B-20A75547CA83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>many publications, thoser from 2008 are: 18428512, 18606173, 18789344, 18423442, 18439404, 18793656, 18650332, 18356198, 18311157, 18619627, 18923032</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>collaborations that enhance the scope of research that it is posible to carry outcollaborations that enhance the scope of research that it is posible to carry out</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The MRC Centre provides the environment that fosters collborations, both old and new, through organising meetings, seminars and symposia.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Biochemistry Bristol</gtr:department><gtr:description>Internal collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>40FDA7B7-B425-4E8C-8C45-768EB9C8A58C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>many publications, thoser from 2008 are: 18428512, 18606173, 18789344, 18423442, 18439404, 18793656, 18650332, 18356198, 18311157, 18619627, 18923032</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>collaborations that enhance the scope of research that it is posible to carry outcollaborations that enhance the scope of research that it is posible to carry out</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The MRC Centre provides the environment that fosters collborations, both old and new, through organising meetings, seminars and symposia.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2008-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Eli Lilly &amp; Company Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Industrial Collaborations</gtr:description><gtr:id>0B7DCF95-C52B-4459-80B5-E43F4D437410</gtr:id><gtr:impact>multiple publications</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>provision of antagonists/agonists, research support, loan of equipment</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>all research has been carried out by researchers employed by members of the Centre</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Web Site</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B2916AC2-A837-43B4-BF8E-3ECB2967FE38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The MRC centre has an extensive web site, detailing the research interests of members, as well as lots of background information on different aspects of neuroscience.

Feedback received via a fedback form is very positive.
