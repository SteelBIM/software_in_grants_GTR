This will include investigating the formal/paid services provided by hairdressers, and the styling and management of hair undertaken by care workers. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>There are four main aims to this research: &lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to describe the experience of hairdressing and explore the significance it holds for older service users&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to describe the workplace experience of care-based hairdressers and care workers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to scrutinise and document the constituent elements of hairdressing encounters&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consider patterns of provision, access and affordability of hairdressing services to older service users. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>This ethnographic study will be conducted over three types of setting: care received at home, long-stay hospital care settings and care homes. It will include observations and filming in care-based salons as well as interviews with care workers, hairdressers and older service users. The findings will inform policy and practices in care and raise the profile of body-work that is fundamental to well-being and the avoidance of decline, depression and neglect. The study addresses an aspect of care settings that is little understood and for which no evidence-base currently exists. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198743</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a training video for practitioners in Australia which details the use of multi-sensory biography method developed for the Hair and Care project.

A particular focus was upon the care-based hair salon and the relationships that unfold between hairdressers' and their clients. Findings for the study are clustered according to three main themes: i) the management and meaning of appearance for people with dementia; ii) care-based hairdressing as a distinctive field of labour and; iii) the role of the hair salon in dementia care.

i) Managing appearance is a way of telling an on-going story of who we are. We found appearances held significance to people with dementia as a source of biographical continuity; as a marker of personal and cultural histories; and as a way of showing a connection to others, particularly a spouse, partner or other family members. Aspects of appearance were used to hold onto the memory of people who had died, and were a way of communicating aspects of a person's character and marking milestones in their life. Following the onset of dementia, we found couples often managed appearance jointly as a way of sustaining couplehood. The research findings pose a challenge to current care practice where maintaining the appearance of people with dementia is often reduced to a set of task-based activities.

ii) Care-based hairdressing (CBH) is a distinctive field of labour; a hybrid of care and hairdressing. We found that hairdressers operate on the margins of the care system; receive little if any training; have minimal involvement in the wider care settings where they work; and tend to operate independently with few opportunities for contact with fellow care-based hairdressers. As a workforce they are largely invisible within policy and research. And, while CBH is valued and beneficial to clients its full potential to support person-centred care is currently unrecognised by care providers. Our research has helped to identify aspects of good practice and reveal diverse outcomes for people with dementia that offer useful insights for social care. 

iii) The care-based salon is a unique space in dementia care valued by the people who use it. It opens up new contexts for communication, often being a place where people share insights into their own lives, support one another, and show interest in each other's lives. The salon space can feel familiar and reassuring to people who have used salons throughout their lives but was also found to serve different purposes according to context. In some cases it can be a place of sanctuary from a busy hospital ward, in others it provides opportunities for socializing and peer support. In other care settings the salon offered a safe space for people to voice their concerns and views of the care they receive. Often salons have to be staged when the hairdresser arrives in spaces as diverse as bathrooms, corridors or communal day rooms. Hence, we were given insights into how people with dementia and hairdressers work together to redefine spaces in care and create the salon as a distinct social and material place for coming together.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>With regard to potential impact on the 'user community' our intention is to use the findings of the study to promote change within health and social care in terms of how care-based hairdressing is understood, and the potential integration of hairdressers into the wider therapeutic objectives of different care settings. There are a number of levels at which we intend to work for change. First, there is a compelling case for raising the profile and awareness of care-based hairdressing with care providers who currently have limited understanding of the nature of this work and its outcomes for clients. We intend to work with organisations such as the National Association for Providers of Activities for Older People (NAPA), the My Home Life network and Alzheimer Scotland to communicate with providers. Second, our findings offer insights into potential developments in social care practice with people with dementia. This applies particularly to recognising the significance of sensory and embodied experience as a domain for meaningful communication and the maintenance of relationships and we intend to pilot a tool to promote this in dementia care. Third, we plan to address the current situation and status of care-based hairdressers themselves, who currently receive no training, minimal workplace support and have no opportunities for peer support. We will be providing guidance on good practice based on the project findings, and working with HABIA to create a networking resource for care-based hairdressers to share insights, experience and good practice with fellow workers. To ensure maximum impact for our findings, a planned series of academic outputs in the form of journal papers is currently being produced, alongside on-going presentations at high profile national and international conferences. During the life of the research we developed a network of individuals with shared research interests and through this will be collaborating on paper-writing and a book proposal. An end of project academic conference was also held to disseminate our findings and locate our work in the context of related research.

In terms of non-academic outputs, we have successfully bid for funding to develop and pilot the 'appearance biography' interview method, developed for the project, as a tool for dementia care practice. We plan to produce a series of briefings for care providers to raise the profile of care-based hairdressing and its benefits to person-centred care and will be publishing a number of articles in practitioner journals including the Journal of Dementia Care. We have successfully advocated for the introduction of an award for care-based hairdressing as part of the Annual Care Awards in the UK to raise the profile of CBH. We will also be working in collaboration with the Hair and Beauty Industry Authority (HABIA) to develop good practice guidance for care-based hairdressing and will contribute to training materials for hairdressers in raising awareness of dementia.
