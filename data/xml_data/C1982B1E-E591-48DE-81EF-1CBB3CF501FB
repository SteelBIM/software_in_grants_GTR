There will also be development in drug research through the creation of complex tissue models in vitro that mimic certain body systems. With these models we will be able to reduce the need for animal testing and provide a deeper understanding of the impact of drugs on cell function. To undertake these changes, one requires a fabrication technique that can accommodate a wider choice of biomaterials, combined with delivery of complexity in terms of feature size, structure and functionalities. This project aims to develop a new biomaterial fabrication technique which can process different material elements into a sizable scaffold in a controllable, scalable manner. The configuration will be tailored to fit the ultimate reaction kinetics of the biomaterial. This technique will exhibit (a) a sub-micron printing resolution of fibrous structures (vs. tens of micron of the existing 3-D printing), (b) ability to co-print both fibrous components and interstitial gel components, (c) suitability for scaled-up fabrication of a vast biomaterial library without needing to modify the native material chemistry. Ultimately, this new biomaterial fabrication technique will enable the reproducible, automated creation of multi-functional biomaterial scaffolds to support soft tissue regeneration. It is believed that the proposed technique will facilitate the fabrication of personalised scaffold parts, thus enabling more effective treatment available to the general public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Biomaterial-based tissue engineering has made significant impact on people's lives. Examples are as demonstrated with skin grafts for burn victims reducing scarring and improving healing, orthopaedic implants dramatically improving the mobility of patients, and tissue grafts for regenerating bladder functions. The global tissue engineering market is projected to be approximately &amp;pound;18 billion by 2020, which doubles the current (2014) market value of &amp;pound;9 billion. To improve the treatment outcome, and also to tackle difficult applications such as growing tissue organ transplants, innovation in tissue engineering has to be made. As stated in the EPSRC Healthcare grant challenges, enabling technologies for regenerative medicine, and patient specific treatment are two of the key areas where research inputs will generate significant impact. In this project, the technology developed will enable the deposition of a versatile range of biomaterials of mixed properties for personalised treatments. This capability is currently not adequately supported by existing fabrication technologies. The development of the proposed new biomaterial fabrication method will potentially open new avenues to tailored implants and the creation of more informative drug testing technologies. This will provide the next step change in current healthcare technologies. 

For the ultimate implementation of the proposed instrumentation, its design concept will facilitate its use in a hospital setting. This attribute can greatly reduce the problems associated with preservation of the tissue scaffold from the manufacturing site to the point of use. The potential reduction in lead time will also add significant benefit to the treatment outcome. 

In addition to its relevance to Healthcare, the proposed work will provide a new technology added to the existing repertoire of additive manufacturing methods. Currently, the global additive manufacturing market is valued at &amp;pound;1 billion per year. Among this, automoes accounts for the largest share of the market since end-products can be more conveniently produced. With new technologies developed, such as the one presented in this project, additive manufacturing will generate wider impacts in other industries such as electronics, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food. This sees the potential to have improved manufacturing processes which is low-waste, energy efficient and stream-lined. This will in turn lead to improved productivity, and more environmentally friendly productions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99393</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Pittsburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pittsburgh decellularised matrix</gtr:description><gtr:id>3479DCA6-28E4-4548-B290-B7C4F99F9FAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work has started since Sep 2015, when the materials transfer agreements were completed and the materials were delivered.

(1) An ultra-low voltage electrospinning mechanism. Traditionally, electrospinning is a versatile technique for the construction of microfibrous and nanofibrous structures with considerable potential in applications ranging from textile manufacturing to tissue engineering scaffolds. In the simplest form, electrospinning uses a high voltage of tens of thousands volts to draw out fine polymer fibres. However, the high voltage limits flexibility in the material selections as well as deposition targets. Prior studies show that by performing electrospinning with a well-defined 'near-field' condition, the operation voltage can be decreased to the kilovolt range, and further enable more precise patterning of fibril structures on a planar surface. In this work, by using solution dependent 'initiators', we demonstrate a further lowering of voltage with an ultra-low voltage continuous electrospinning patterning (LEP) technique, which reduces the applied voltage threshold to as low as 50 V, simultaneously permitting direct fibre patterning. The versatility of LEP is shown using a wide range of combination of polymer and solvent systems. Novel functionalities are also incorporated when a low voltage mode is used in place of a high voltage mode, such as: direct printing of living bacteria; the construction of free-standing two dimensional (2D) and three dimensional (3D) networks; and the incorporation of a fibrous matrix within microfluidics. The LEP technique reported here should open up new avenues in the direct writing of geometrically defined bio-elements and free-form nanofibrous structures.

(2) A two-axis bioprinter which incorporates the LEP mechanism is due to be completed. This printer is based on an open source platform. 

(3) A microfluidics system which enables the printing of hydrogel materials has been designed and produced which allows small volumes of materials to be printed.

(4) Scaffold constructs based on gelatin nanofibres on PLA grids are successfully fabricated.

(5) Collaborative work on mesenchymal stem cell's differentiation potential on the scaffolds resulted from (4) is now under way. 

(6) Collaboration established with Aether 1 to incoporate LEP into their 8-axis printer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From a technology development aspect, the instrumentation technique can be potentially incorporated into 3D printing mechanism to improve the resolution and versatility of biomaterials printing. 
The scaffolds fabricated provides a tool for studying topography dependent stem cell differentiation. 

Although the proposed technique is set out to address the technology requirement in bioprinting/ biofabrication, the LEP technique and also the multi-material printing technique can have impacts across a number of fields which require controlled deposition of nano- micro fibres.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>80D0D602-5B19-43A8-9389-50C73FA868D6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Electronics,Energy,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/91A65C6F-B705-4F0B-9941-D865C786E54E"><gtr:id>91A65C6F-B705-4F0B-9941-D865C786E54E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Microfluidic on-chip biomimicry for 3D cell culture: a fit-for-purpose investigation from the end user standpoint</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Future Science OA</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d7c92a675b6502a97a707b04cca69bc1"><gtr:id>d7c92a675b6502a97a707b04cca69bc1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Liu Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A543D902-2689-44E2-99F0-650B93EC596E"><gtr:id>A543D902-2689-44E2-99F0-650B93EC596E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Low-Voltage Continuous Electrospinning Patterning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb"><gtr:id>93f8556619f3487d06c35513ec7d86fb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Li X</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1944-8244</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M018989/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
