Recognising the reciprocal relationship between disability and poverty, leading to increased vulnerability and social exclusion, disability has been flagged as a key development issue in meeting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and in eradicating world poverty. As a consequence, PWDs are increasingly being mainstreamed into government social protection programmes in low- and middle-income countries. However, there has been little evaluation of the effectiveness of these programmes with respect to PWDs. This research evaluates the efficacy of two government social protection programmes for PWDs in Vietnam, including a cash transfer programme and a free health insurance programme.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To understand the multi-dimensional aspects of the efficacy of social protection programmes, the research adopts a mixed methods approach that includes quantitative and qualitative methods of analysis. Rigorous quantitative analysis of national household survey data will be combined with qualitative interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders from Government, Disabled People's Organisations, and PWDs and their families, to evaluate the effectiveness of programmes in targeting PWDs and in providing financial protection against poverty.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One primary beneficiary of this proposed research will be policy makers involved with the design of social protection programmes for persons with disabilities (PWDs) in developing countries. By using a case study of Vietnam, the proposed research will provide useful policy lessons and recommendations for the targeting of disability in social protection programmes in developing countries. The various outputs of the research will be disseminated through the participating organisations's global network of partners, including partners DFID and AusAID that are well positioned to promote the work to policy makers in partner country governments.
 
Most importantly, PWDs and their families will benefit from the intended outcomes of this research: accurate targeting and design of social protection programmes that are sensitive to their specific needs. Aside from being the direct beneficiaries of the work, PWDs and their representative organizations, Disabled Peoples Organizations (DPOs), will benefit from the disability-inclusive approach adopted in this research. By actively engaging the voice of PWDs and DPOs in Vietnam, the research will build capacity within the disability community for the creation and consumption of research. The research approach will build a model of best practice that can be used to the benefit of PWDs and DPOs in other countries. 

Another important beneficiary of this research is bi-lateral donor organizations, such as DFID, AusAID, and GIZ, that are committed to disability-inclusive development and to meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Through its various research outputs, this research will provide guidance to donors on how to advise partner governments in adopting a disability-inclusive approach to the development of social protection policy and programmes for PWDs. This will be an important addition to their existing efforts in disability-inclusive development. 

Many of the lessons from this research on how to accurately target PWDs and design programmes sensitive to the needs of PWDs will be transferrable to non-government programmes on poverty alleviation, such as cash transfer and micro-finance programmes. The work will therefore be of great interest to the large civil society sector working in the field of disability-inclusive development. Two significant non-government organizations (NGOs) working in the field of poverty alleviation for PWDs, Leonard Cheshire Disability (UK) and Christian Blind Mission (Australia), are closely tied to the partner organizations of this research in the University College London and Nossal Institute for Global Health, respectively. These organizations, in turn, have close relations with, and will help disseminate the findings of this research to, other significant NGOs working in the sector, such as Handicap International and Disabled People's International. 

As a subpopulation that is prone to chronic poverty and social exclusion, the successful inclusion of PWDs in social protection programmes is perceived as of paramount importance in achieving the MDGs targets. This work will therefore also be of great interest to international policy makers and organizations in the field of social protection. Most notably, these include the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) who has recently launched a major report on social protection in Asia and the Pacific, and the International Labour Organisation which is a long term advocate of social protection. 

Bringing together three of the leading researchers on social protection and disability in developing countries, this project will provide an important reference for future researchers.

This extensive series of meetings lead to many requests for additional input, information and consultation.

The assembled group then discussed implications of the findings for current and future policy and programs relating to persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups in country as these related to Social Protection issue

Several groups have approached us to continue work with them in various domains related to social protection and people with disabilities - including the Vietnamese Government Office of Statistics, in-country academic colleagues and NGOs like the Vietnam Veterans of America.

We have already been asked by our colleagues in the Government of Vietnam to provide advice and consultation regarding improment in elibility criteria for vulernable individuals in their Social Proteciton Scheme. Our initial set of publications, such as the recent paper on Child Health Insurance in Vietnam published in Social Science in Medicine made the Social Science Research Network's Top Ten list the week it was published (Nov 13th) - and apparently is being widely downloaded, our initial set of publications and presentations are already being cited in the literature in public health, health economics, development and disability. Finally, I amd my colleagues (Mont, Mitra, Palmer) routinely advise for UNICEF, UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs, the WHO and UN Statistics - we have been discussing and prsenting our series of papers and forthcoming papers within these networks, as well as at academic conferences and seminars over the past year and had a sigificant outpouring of interest. A series of papers developed from this study - which we anticipate will be about 6 papers in the peer reviewed literature in total - has already begun to find their way into the academic literature (Social Science and Medicine; Health Economics) - and we anticipate that once publication is completed, this body of work will also be used by scholars and policy makers in both developed and developoing countries.

YEAR -1-2 Following End of Award Period

Based on the findings from this study, we continue to work with our colleagues in the Government of Vietnam Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) to provide advice and consultation regarding improvement in eligibility criteria for vulnerable individuals in their Social Protection Scheme. Our initial set of publications, such as the paper on Child Health Insurance in Vietnam published in Social Science in Medicine made the Social Science Research Network's Top Ten list the week it was published (Nov 13, 2014) - and is regularly being downloaded and cited. We continue to finalise and submit papers related to this field study, the most recent one - Extra Costs of Living with Disability: A systematized review and agenda for research - having been accepted in February 2017 by The Economic Record - will published shortly. Publications and presentations related to this project have been regularly presented at academic conferences and are being cited in the international literature in public health, health economics, development and disability. We are particularly pleased that much of this work is being cited and used within Vietnam itself. Finally, I and my colleagues (Mont, Mitra, Palmer) routinely advise for UN agencies (UNICEF, UN Department of Social and Economic Affairs, the World Health Organisation and UN Statistics) - and we regularly cite and include this work from Vietnam within these networks to influence and advise top officials and their staffs regarding policy and programming to improve the lives of persons with disabilities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9FF683E7-18B0-4430-88D6-D876577F95EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study found that the Social Protection scheme for children and adults with disabilities in Vietnam is linked with an increase in the amount of health care received by participants. However the issue of available Social Protection schemes are more complicated than simply presence/absense of such schemes. The qualitative component of our study shows that the amount of assistance available to families with disabled members did not adqueately meet the economic stresses of living with a disability. Thus a key take away message is that we need to ask not just about the availabilty of social protection schemes in low and middle-income countries, but the nature of such schemes. Furthermore, we found that where families did not have enough money to meet health and other related expenses, the coping mechanisms identified - drawing upon savings, borrowing money, foregoing expenditures and substituting labour - while helping to maintain living standards in the short-run, threaten long-term economic welfare of both the individual and their household, with implications for intergenerational poverty (selling assets, taking children out of school). In summary, our informants reported that current social protection programs are not accessible to all and address some immediate economic costs of disability but do not successfully meet current needs nor take into consideration long-term economic challenges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I am pleased to report that in the time since the end of the award, the Government of Vietnam has used our data to help them shape plans and training for staff on individuals with disabilities. The research team assembled through this award - both scholars from the UK, US and Australia and our colleagues at the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs, Government of Vietnam, have been awarded a follow up grant from DFAT to pursue research on the new Vietnamese Disability Determination system - based at the Commune level.

A key point, identified in the narrative section - is that the publications in academic press, presentations at forums that range from UN agencies to research conferences - have helped contribute to the discussion about social protection now underway in many emerging economies, particularly in the transition from low to middle-income country status, Social Protection schemes are now considered an important mechanism to ensure that those at the very bottom of the economic ladder - (people with disabilities, women, the elderly) - are protected against extreme poverty. However, as we have noted in the publications and presentations that have come out of this research findings for this project, it is vital - - to go beyond the question of the presence/absence of such Social Protection schemes to ask critical questions regarding the nature, extent and accessibility of such schemes if vulnerable individuals and groups are going to be truely protected against extreme poverty. We are pleased that the results of this project seem to be contributing to this global discussion.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC463B77-A4B9-4A5E-AAC8-BE71C1B36B22</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.leonardcheshire.org.idc</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on Government practice, NGO and Disabled Peoples' Organisations Expectations for Future Services</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58E971D6-E1F7-4BF4-A854-C6678B05B115</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bringing together Government, NGOs, academia and civil society with disability advocates has provided a previously non-existent forum for discussion and debate.
