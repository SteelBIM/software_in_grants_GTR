The study has received provisional ethical approval from the Open University Human Research Ethics Committee.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will have a significant impact in four key areas: academic research and teaching, policy development, improving services, and the lives of young men.

In academic terms, the research will be of benefit to researchers and educators in a range of disciplines, including sociology, psychology and gender studies, but also in vocational disciplines such as social work and education. The study will contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of how young masculinities develop, of relationships between young men and professionals, and of the part played by gender identities and practices in care and welfare relationships.

In policy terms, the research will inform the efforts of policy-makers, campaigners, commentators and others, contributing to the development of a more effective, nuanced and evidence-based policy response to the needs of young men, for example in relation to youth offending, antisocial behaviour, educational underachievement and mental health problems. By raising questions about the 'male role model' discourse, the research will also be of interest to a wider general audience that we will seek to engage through specific media interventions.

In relation to service delivery, the main beneficiaries of the research will be managers and frontline staff working in services with vulnerable or 'at risk' young men, for example in youth offending teams, youth work, social work, counselling projects, and schools and colleges. The research will foster more critical and informed understandings of how gender 'works' in professional relationships with young men, and will provide guidance to staff on improving those relationships. The partnership with Action for Children will provide the opportunity for the research to engage directly with the culture and practices of a major agency in contact with vulnerable young people, as well as acting as a springboard for a wider impact on the recruitment, training and supervision of both male and female professionals.

Finally, the research will benefit young men themselves, particularly those in vulnerable and 'at risk' groups, by helping to ensure that policy and services targeted at them are more critically and sensitively attuned to their needs. The young people who participate in the research, as well as other young service users in contact with Action for Children, will benefit in terms of confidence and skills through direct involvement in the study and in the planned impact activities.

Making an impact on policy and practice was built into the research project from the outset in a number of important ways. The project was a partnership with Action for Children and we also worked closely with Working With Men. Both organisations were closely involved in the project steering committee. Senior staff from both agencies attended our launch conference and policy seminar and declared that the study had already begun to influence the way their services worked with boys and young men. Our steering committee also included representatives from government and third sector organisations who helped to ensure that our findings were disseminated to a broad policy and practice audience. 

During the funding period, and in the subsequent year, project team members have been involved in a wide range of activities which we believe have begun to have a significant influence on policy and practice in relation to work with boys and young men, as set out below. 

Policy impact

In June 2014 Martin Robb (Principal Investigator) and Sandy Ruxton (consultant) gave a presentation about the research study to a roundtable meeting on engaging men for gender equality, organised by the UK Government Equalities Office. One outcome was that Martin Robb was asked to represent the UK at a European Commission exchange of good practice seminar in Helsinki, Finland, in October 2014. Subsequent to this the GEO invited Martin to participate in a panel, alongside a government minister and third sector representatives, at the National Consultation with Women NGO Event, and in another panel discussion on men and gender equality, alongside a government minister and business representatives, organised by the Women's Business Council and Barclays in the City of London. Martin Robb was also invited to join a panel with a Member of Parliament and business representative organised in 2015 by Ernst and Young and the City Women's Network. This series of activities culminated in Martin receiving an invitation from Nicky Morgan, the Minister for Women and Equalities, to join business leaders and representatives from education in the new 'Men as Change Agents' working group, sponsored by the Government Equalities Office and the Women's Business Council. The group has been appointed for three years, after which it will report to government. All of these invitations have come about as a direct result of the research study and have presented opportunities for Martin to disseminate the findings of the study to politicians, civil servants, business leaders and leading representatives from the voluntary sector.

For the study's launch seminar in October 2013, Sandy Ruxton prepared a paper outlining the policy context and the relevance of the research to policies in relation to fatherhood, education, and childcare. The seminar was attended by representatives from policy 'think tanks', voluntary organisations and academia, and provided an opportunity to raise awareness policy issues arising from the study among key stakeholder groups. A recording of the event was made and shared online. There are plans to update the policy paper in late 2016 so as to further stimulate public debate. 

In November 2014 Sandy Ruxton gave a presentation to the MenEngage 2nd Global Symposium in Delhi, India. Sandy subsequently also presented the research at a meeting of about 30 NGO members of the MenEngage Europe network in Zagreb, Croatia. The Symposium was attended by 1200 participants from 95 countries, including global leaders from international organisations, government representatives, and activists from a wide range of NGOs. Considerable interest was expressed in the research, and a chapter on the study has been accepted for a forthcoming international collection that will be relevant not just to academics but also to wider audiences. Sandy gave a presentation on the research to the 'Feminism in London' conference in October 2015, attended by over 1000 women from across the country and beyond. This provided an opportunity to discuss the research with a key constituency of activists, and prompted an invitation to write an opinion piece in Huffington Post in November 2015. To date, this article has been 'liked' 407 times, and 'shared' 85 times, on Facebook. 

In November 2015, Sandy also chaired a session on boys' education at the two-day 'Being a Man' festival at the Southbank Centre in London. The panel for the session was composed of people working directly with young men in schools. The session was attended by about 200 people (mainly men), and was open to a general audience. The discussion explored, among other things, issues relating to 'male role models', and whether boys and young men were influenced primarily by male teachers, or both male and female teachers. The video of this session has been viewed 290 times on Youtube. 

In March 2016 Martin Robb and Brigid Featherstone (Co-Investigator) gave a presentation on the findings of the research study to the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fatherhood, chaired by David Lammy MP. Although it is too early to assess the impact on policy of this event, it was encouraging that a number of those attending, including Mr Lammy, requested further information, and reference was made to our study's relevance to his current review, at the request of the Prime Minister, of outcomes for black young men. 

A new book by well-known author Rebecca Asher ('Man Up: Boys, Men and Breaking the Male Rules', to be published in May 2016 by Random House) refers explicitly to the research study in a specific section on role models, and rehearses some of the policy and practice arguments outlined in our work. It can be expected that the launch of this book, appealing to a popular, non-academic audience, will stimulate significant public discussion about the issues involved.


Practice impact

In early 2015 Martin Robb gave a presentation about the findings of the research study to practitioners at Southwark Youth Offending Service in London. As a result, the Service used the findings as the basis for its summer programme with young offenders. An exhibition was held in August 2015, displaying art work and audio and video projects by participants in the programme. The research study can be said to have resulted in improving the awareness and skills of practitioners, and also changing the attitudes and behaviour of service users.

Brigid Featherstone's presentation to the Joint Social Work Education Conference aimed to encourage social work educators from across the UK and internationally to reflect on how issues relating to boys and young men are dealt with in social work training. The result has been interest in revitalising a network of practitioners, educators and policy makers around gender and child welfare in order to develop accessible briefings for practitioners working with boys and young men. Brigid gave a presentation on the research to senior managers at Leeds City Council in March 2016. The study's findings are being used to inform the development of restorative and relationship-based approaches to work with families. 

Brigid's presentations on the research to the Directors of Children's and Adult Services, to Calderdale Safeguarding Children Board, and a Making Research Count event on mental health issues for boys and men, have further disseminated our findings to a wide range of practitioners. Both of these events were received positively by practitioners who reflected on the importance of ensuring their services incorporate a gender dimension. Brigid Featherstone has offered consultancy to workers who seek to strengthen their practice. 

In January 2016 Martin Robb, Brigid Featherstone and Sandy Ruxton presented a paper on the research study, and showed the project video, to a 200-strong audience of social work practitioners at a Making Research Count conference at King's College, London, leading for many requests for further information and resources (including the video) to be used in local staff training and development events.

Summary

As a result of these activities, which are ongoing, the research study has gained a high profile among policy-makers and practitioners concerned with the welfare of boys and young men. There are already signs that the findings of the study have begun to influence policy discussions and to have an impact on direct work with vulnerable boys and young men. At this early stage, it is difficult to point to specific changes in policy and practice, but we are confident that these will become apparent in the coming months.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>06562D5E-67E5-4795-A52D-0BB276BBAD48</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Young men 'at risk' have often experienced difficult family relationships, including negative relationships with their fathers, but some also have positive relationships with their mothers and strong female influences in their lives. The experience of becoming a father can provide a catalyst for making the transition to a more responsible masculine identity.
Young men's masculine identities are strongly defined by locality. Young men 'at risk' tend to be embedded in local cultures of hypermasculinity, often with problematic consequences. Many aspire to a 'safer' and more responsible masculinity, with their aspirations again being largely shaped by local expectations.
Support services provide a vital 'third space' in which young men can make the transition to safer and less risky adult masculine identities, with activities providing the gateway to practical advice, emotional support and the building of relationships.
Young men using support services value the personal qualities and commitment of staff above their gender or other social identities.
Young men value respect, trust, consistency, and a sense of care and commitment, in workers, and these qualities are key to developing effective helping relationships.
A sense of shared experience and social background between young men and staff can be valuable in developing effective relationships, and in 'modelling' transitions to a more positive masculine identity.
 Although the term 'male role model' was used by some young men and staff, there was a lack of clarity about what was meant by it.
Workers in support services act less as role models for young men to imitate, and more as mentors or guides with whom they are able to negotiate and co-construct new identities andfutures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research points to the importance of policy and practice taking account of the diverse and complex family relationships, local cultures and social inequalities that have shaped the lives of young men in contact with support services. At the same time, there is a need to recognise that many young men come to services because they are seeking to make the transition to a 'safer' adult masculine identity, and that their aspirations - for a job, family, home - are not very different from those of other young people.
At a time when the funding and futures of support services are under threat, this research demonstrates the vital role that such services play in offering a safe, transitional space in which young men 'at risk' can begin to construct better futures for themselves. Within these services, the paramount importance of helping relationships based on care, trust and consistency has been demonstrated, pointing to a need to make relationship-building central to staff training, team development and performance agendas.
The research also raises important questions about the relative importance of gender and other social identities in recruiting staff to work with vulnerable young men. Gender identities and relationships inform young men's lives in important and complex ways, and being able to identify with staff along the lines of gender, ethnicity or shared social background certainly plays a role and should not be overlooked. However, effective work with young men seems to depend above all on personal qualities and commitment, and on the ability to form relationshipsof mutual care and respect.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>62821B28-C313-4778-91DE-5ED5C32F5300</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.open.ac.uk/health-and-social-care/research/beyond-male-role-models/report</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Southwark Youth Offending Service summer programme based on our research findings</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58EA445A-A6C8-4784-B708-D891B0519D8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Southwark Youth Offending Service organised a summer programme for young male and female offenders in 2015, based on the findings of our 'Beyond Male Role Models' research, and following our presentation to their professional team.
