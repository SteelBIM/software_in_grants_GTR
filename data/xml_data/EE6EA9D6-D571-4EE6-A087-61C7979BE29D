In sign languages, linguistic information is provided by the hands, but also by the body, face and mouth. In spoken languages, speech sounds are combined with visible mouth movements and gestures. Such information from different sources is tightly synchronised, facilitating comprehension. Most studies of signed and spoken language, however, focus on a single dominant modality (hands or speech), and therefore little is known about how the different types of information are integrated in comprehending language.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project investigates the integration of mouth and hands in signed and spoken languages, testing how integration affects language comprehension in British Sign Language (BSL) and English, and the extent to which common neural systems subserve integration for signed and spoken languages.This will be achieved by digitally manipulating BSL and English video materials, creating stimuli with mismatches in content or timing of information from the hands and mouth (eg saying &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; but gesturing &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot;). Behavioural experiments will test the consequences of different types of mismatches on comprehending language; functional MRI studies will investigate which neural systems are involved in integrating information from the hands and mouth in the the two languages. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The general BSL community
The proposed research has important consequences especially for the Deaf community in the UK as primary users of a minority language (BSL) in a majority language environment (English). To date there has been little research on the role of mouthings in BSL, and existing research has largely targeted academic audiences. As a result there are widely varying opinions in the community about the nature of mouthing beyond the appreciation that it is the product of language contact: whether it should be considered a full-fledged part of BSL, or an optional form of simultaneous bilingual expression possible when mouth patterns are not specified in BSL (i.e. a flexible communication tactic to be deployed only in some contexts). As a result, the treatment of mouthing in BSL educational contexts is highly variable, with only implicit attention to mouthing except in situations where specific mouth gestures should accompany particular signs. Findings from the proposed research clarifying the role of mouthing in BSL has potential impact on those groups outside of academia who have specific vested interest in knowing more about the language: BSL tutors, students, interpreters, interpreter trainers, communication support workers, etc (as well as international users with interest in other sign languages). 

Educational practice
This project can also inform educational practice: finding a high degree of integration between hand and mouth in sign comprehension implies that substantial benefits could be gained by explicit treatment of mouthing in sign language education. Furthermore, explicit attention to English-derived mouthing that accompanies BSL may offer further benefits to English literacy education for deaf children, supplementing instruction that focuses purely upon English phonological awareness with additional links to the English-derived mouthings that accompany many BSL signs. Potential users of research findings are individuals involved in education of deaf children (whether in deaf schools or mainstream education), as well as other educational environments in which multimodal approaches may provide benefits.

Language rehabilitation
Evidence that gestures can facilitate communication across various contexts, along with results of the proposed studies related to integration of audio-visual speech and gesture both have implications for rehabilitation. It may be especially promising to consider how gesture combined with visible speech can benefit in cases of language difficulty. Although a few studies have tested the efficacy of gesture-based interventions, such approaches have been considered only to a very limited extent despite growing awareness that the multimodal nature of spoken language should be considered in atypical language contexts. Potential users in this domain are speech and language therapists.

Communication technology
Effective communication in noisy environments has long been a goal of the communications industry, and the boom in video communication now permits spoken language to be accompanied by video in numerous cases. Findings of strong integration and comprehension benefit for gestures accompanying speech would imply that inclusion of hands and body in spoken video messages could facilitate video communication beyond head-alone video messages. In BSL, a better understanding of how mouthing is integrated in comprehension should provide substantial improvements in automatic sign language recognition technology as well as the development of effective sign language avatars. In both domains, it is recognised that mouthing is essential to successful performance, yet implementation of mouthing lags far behind. Results from the proposed research will inform these domains especially by identifying the conditions under which integration is most effective, thus having relevance for individuals involved in applying speech/sign language recognition technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Psychology Taster lectures</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6ED75F36-01A6-4E47-8BCE-AEA98EF4DF79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approx 300 prospective applicants to UCL's BSc Psychology programme (mostly aged 16-17) and approx 200 parents/guardians attended one of six Psychology Taster lectures delivered by David Vinson (topic: &amp;quot;language, communication and nonverbal expression&amp;quot;) as part of UCL's Open Days in June and September 2016.

One means by which this has been accomplished so far is by outreach activities to the general public: The first of these was during the project itself: dinteractive experiments and one-on-one debriefing sessions at the Science Museum London which directly reached more than 350 visitors. After data collection was complete, we presented similar issues and research findings to nearly 500 members of the public (prospective university applicants and their parents) who attended one of six Psychology taster lectures at UCL's summer Open Days for prospective applicants.

Additionally, the specific research programme has led directly to a dramatically increased presence of these subject areas as part of the core BSc Psychology curriculum at UCL: adding specific lectures based on these subjects to modules taken by all students studying Psychology at UCL (more than 300 students since the addition of these content areas), as well as creating specifically focused in-depth modules allowing students with particular interests around these subjects to study them far more deeply (35 students so far). Although this development occurs in an academic setting, the increased salience of these concepts in the programme of study can be said to affect society outside the academy, as the majority of our graduates go on to graduate level work outside university settings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BFB50BA2-2595-4175-97A8-3E6A24B0F485</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Understanding speech and gestures:
We created audio-visual materials of an actor speaking and gesturing, and developed methods to seamlessly combine speech and gestures from different video clips. This allowed us to advance on previous studies about comprehending speech and gesture together, in which a speaker's face was unnaturally obscured or removed from video clips.

In a series of computerised experiments we found that even when the face is visible and the movements correspond to the speech that is heard, comprehenders cannot help paying attention to mismatching gestures, even when they are irrelevant to the task.
When both speech and gestures are relevant to a decision, speech is a more important cue for native speakers. However, non-native speakers were more reliant on gesture in the same conditions, showing how language experience can modulate the balance of the different cues.

When we manipulated the relative timing of speech and gestures using similar video manipulation methods, we found largely the same effects, with only very slight benefits to whichever mode started first, likely due to preparatory information that is visible while a gesture is being formed, and mouth movements that are visible before speech is heard.

Finally, in a functional MRI study, we explored the brain networks involved in understanding speech and gestures together, and those that are active when the two cues provide conflicting meanings (also including video clips with audio-visual speech only, and with gesture only). The key finding of this study was a left-lateralised network incorporating areas often associated with language processing (middle/posterior temporal, parietal, and left inferior frontal gyrus) which was active when speech and gesture occurred together but further elevated when speech and gesture were in conflict, or only one of the two cues was present.

Understanding hands and mouth in sign language comprehension:
We used the same video manipulation methods and conducted a largely parallel set of studies in British Sign Language, presenting silent video clips in which the body and hands from one video were recombined with the head and face from another, to assess how mouth movements affect comprehension of signs in deaf and hearing participants.

In a first experiment with native BSL signers, incongruent mouth patterns interfered with participants' judgments, even when they were irrelevant to the task (participants were told &amp;quot;just pay attention to the hands&amp;quot;), showing that signers cannot help but pay attention to the mouth movements that accompany signs. This effect was comparable for deaf and hearing native signers.

A follow-up study showed a strong imbalance between the two cues when both were relevant to the task: information on the hands was much more important, and participants paid much more attention to it, than mouth movements. This is likely the product of visual and iconic differences: mouth patterns are small, fast-moving and bear little resemblance to the concepts being expressed, vs. the visible movements of the hands and arms, and sign forms which often are highly iconic (depicting aspects of shape, action or movement). Again, no difference was found between deaf and hearing participants with comparable BSL skill: despite very different language experience, and in most instances explicit instruction on speechreading English, mouth patterns in BSL appear to be processed the same regardless of hearing status.

Finally, a functional MRI study was conducted, with similar design to the English study described above but manipulating hands and mouth patterns in BSL. In contrast to the English study in which strong, clear effects were observed for conflicting speech and gesture, conflict between hands and mouth had little discernable effect on neural activity - likely because the hands are much more important a cue for comprehension. Increased activity in temporal-parietal regions for signs with mouth patterns, compared to the same signs with a still face, may be consistent with improved semantic retrieval when mouth movements are consistent with a sign, as is often the case in natural sign production.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings especially highlight the importance of visual information accompanying speech in order for it to be most effectively understood: not just facial movements but the gestures that speakers make when they reflect meaningful aspects of their messages. In many cases this suggests taking more advantage of audio-visual modes of communication especially in noisy environments or when comprehenders may not be fluent users of a language.

For signed languages the findings suggest that mouth patterns are used by comprehenders: not just naturally available in many communicative contexts but contributing to their understanding of a message.
