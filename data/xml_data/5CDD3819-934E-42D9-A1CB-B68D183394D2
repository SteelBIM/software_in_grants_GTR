For example how can animals like crickets, which repetitively generate very loud acoustic signals for intraspecific communication, prevent their auditory pathways from desensitisation or distinguish their own sound signals from the sound of singing rivals? As a solution to this problem neuroscientists proposed a corollary discharge mechanism that is activated by the animals own motor activity and that is mediated to sensory areas to interfere with the processing of self-generated signals. The evidence for corollary discharges is compelling but the cellular basis of this principle of neural processing has been demonstrated only in weakly electric fish, tadpole swimming, crayfish escape behaviour and in singing crickets. In crickets we recently identified a corollary discharge interneurone (CDI), that is activated in the phase of sound production and that inhibits auditory afferents and interneurons, whenever the animals produce a sound pulse during singing. As a consequence their responses to self-generated sound pulses are distinctly reduced and the sensitivity of the auditory pathway is maintained. To complement this picture of the corollary discharge mechanism we now want to progress in three areas. 1. How is CDI activated? Evidence points towards the motor network that generates the singing activity. This network however, has not yet been studied in any detail. We will therefore identify the interneurons of this motor network by intracellular recordings, dye injection and current injection experiments, which demonstrate the functional importance of neurons for pattern recognition. Then we will use simultaneous recordings of the motor network interneurons and of CDI to analyse any synaptic connections between them. These experiments will tell how the corollary discharge is generated in the first place. We expect that interneurons of the motor network, which are active in phase with sound production, drive CDI with excitatory postsynaptic potentials. This would lead to a comprehensive cellular understanding of the corollary discharge mechanisms. 2. Furthermore we want to analyse if CDI affects sensory pathways other than the auditory pathway. This is important for our understanding of the organisation of corollary discharge pathways. CDI has profuse axonal output arborisation in the auditory neuropil but other axonal collaterals project into the mechanosensory neuropils of all ganglia. The arborisation pattern of CDI is therefore suited to modulate other sensory pathways as well - so is it a local or a global corollary discharge pathway? We will analyse neural processing in a wind-sensitive and vibration-sensitive pathway. These pathways are activated by self-generated stimuli during singing but at the same time also have to mediate escape responses. A problem of sensory processing that is most similar to the processing of auditory signals. We will stimulate these pathways with wind puffs or vibration stimuli and we will record the activity of the primary afferents and interneurons to reveal any signs of inhibition during singing. If the experiments demonstrate that sensory processing is modulated by a corollary discharge we will again use double intracellular recordings to analyse the synaptic interaction between CDI and afferents and interneurons of these pathways. Our experiments will reveal, if CDI globally modulates sensory processing during singing, as it is indicated by its structure. 3. Finally, we will analyse the details of CDI's arborisation pattern with histological sections. This will show the overlap of its axonal arborisations with mechanosensory neuropils. We also will use immunohistochemistry to demonstrate if GABA is the transmitter of the interneurone that mediates the inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic potentials.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Experiments are based on our substantial experience to evoke singing behaviour in crickets by pharmacological brain stimulation and to expose their nervous system to intracellularly record from primary afferents or central interneurons in semi-intact and de-efferented preparations. 1. SYNAPTIC LINK BETWEEN THE SINGING CPG AND CDI: Intracellular recordings will be obtained from metathoracic interneurons involved in motor pattern generation. We will identify the neurons and test their functional significance by current injection and reset experiments. Motor activity will be monitored by recording wing movements with an opto-electronic camera (custom made) and activity of mesothoracic motor nerves or muscles (AM 1700 amplifier). CPG neurons will be stained with Lucifer yellow and confocal microscopy will be used to demonstrate their structure. Simultaneous recordings of CDI and CPG wing closer interneurons will reveal the synaptic connections between the motor network and the corollary discharge pathway. The two amplifiers (NPI, BA-1S) will be used for these recordings. 2. GLOBAL OR LOCAL FUNCTION OF CDI? In an approach similar to our protocol for the analysis of auditory processing we will explore processing in the wind-sensitive cercal pathway and vibration-sensitive leg chordotonal organs. Wind puffs (Picopump PV820) and/or vibration stimuli (B&amp;amp;K exciter) will be used for stimulation. Intracellular recordings of afferents and sensory interneurons will reveal any central impact on sensory processing during singing. The synaptic link between CDI and these sensory pathways will be revealed with double intracellular recordings. 3. STRUCTURE AND NEUROTRANSMITTER OF CDI: Staining of CDI will be obtained with Lucifer yellow or Neurobiotin. Stained neurons will be embedded and sectioned on a microtom. Immunohistochemistry using GABA or histamine anitibodies will be used to identify the transmitter candidate. Picrotoxin may be used to block GABA receptors.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>317445</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A video on brain stimulation in grasshoppers has been edited and uploaded to You-Tube</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E5F6E85-E20A-468F-9164-5B056F2B81E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video may be very useful for lecturing in neurobiology</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Grasshopper brain stimulation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lT_PKFV5r8</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We recorded the song patterns of different species of crickets that we keep in our lab as a reference for further neurobiological experiments.</gtr:description><gtr:id>750B5993-F8FB-4A7A-8E12-D37AC857C918</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have a proper dataset of song patterns for the sound patterns used in the neurobiological experiments</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Song patterns of different cricket species</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Corollary Discharges in the CNS of Singing Crickets</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E6E6CBD-F1E2-438E-B808-B3EEB901A6B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to be presented at the HHMI Janelia Workshop on Corollary Discharges from 29-31 May 2013

Auditory systems are designed to respond with high sensitivity to acoustic signals from the environment. At the same time, however, they may be exposed to sounds self-generated by the animal. Responses to self-generated signals interfere with signals from the environment and may desensitise the sensory pathway unless the nervous system deals with self-generated information in a specific way. Experiments on the visual pathway of fish and flies led Sperry and v. Holst and Mittelstaedt in 1950 to propose that a corollary discharge mechanism is generated by the CNS to modulate the animal's response to self-generated visual stimuli. Here I report on the cellular basis of a corollary discharge mechanism that modulates auditory processing in singing crickets.

Important neurons of the singing network are located in the first free abdominal ganglion. This organisation of the neural network for singing was very different to previous published assumptions. We now have extended this project and we have identified the free abdominal ganglia as the location of the singing CPG and have identifies neurons of a pulse-timer and a chirp-timer network.

Inhibition of the cercal wind sensitive pathway by a corollary discharge was demonstrated in singing crickets. This corollary discharge is not mediated by the previously identified CDI interneuron, that mediates an inhibition of the audirory pathway in singing crickets. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of sensory processing in singing crickets occurs via parallel pathways of corollary discharge interneurons. Having established the basic organisation of the singing CPG we are now in a position to to analyse the synaptic connectivity of the central pattern generating network to the CDI interneurons.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research reveals some fundamental mechanisms underlying the processing of self-generated sensory signals during the generation of motor activity.
