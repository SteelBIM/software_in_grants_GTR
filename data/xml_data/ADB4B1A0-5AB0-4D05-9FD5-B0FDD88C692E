Through detailed qualitative case-studies in Kenya and Zambia, PIMA critically interrogates the heralded potential for digital communications and liberalised media sectors to promote more responsive and inclusive democratic governance, with a keen eye for turning project insights into relevance for policymakers, media houses, journalists and development organisations.&lt;br />&lt;br />By employing survey-based, qualitiative and ethnographic methods to comparatively analyse interactive radio and TV programmes in the context of electoral and everyday politics, we will probe whose voice counts, why and to what effects in these new digitally-enabled spaces of voice and accountability. The project takes into account local innovation in the use of ICTs and the interactions between different modes, venues and actors of information gathering and dissemination that are particularly prominent in African contexts. PIMA brings together researchers from the Universities of Cambridge, Nairobi and Zambia and the Centre for Policy Dialogue in Lusaka, working closely with select broadcast stations and other stakeholders.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research project targets four policy and practice beneficiary groups:
1. African (initially Kenyan and Zambian) media professionals and publics.
2. International and local NGOs working in media development, grassroots governance participation and government accountability/transparency; and public opinion research organisations/programmes
3. African (initially Kenyan and Zambian) policy makers and politicians
4. Donors with pro-poor programmes focused on ICT for development, democratisation, participatory governance or accountability and transparency.

We envisage that through impact pathway activities they will benefit from insights into how more robust, representative and regular public opinion championed by broadcast media can improve governance discussions and political accountability and protect against destructive political manipulation.

We will pursue this overarching benefit for these groups through three pathways: 

1. Communications and engagement: knowledge transfer through direct engagement of end-users in the research design and through dissemination of findings. We will enable end users to access project insights on demand through a project social network platform (based on Elgg: http://elgg.org/), we will invite stakeholders to sessions during all three major project workshops and host major knowledge-practice workshops at project end, focused on identifying specific improvements in government regulatory policy for the media, media self-regulatory practice, in-house training and principled commiments, and donor and NGO programmatic interventions. We will work with broadcast media to support awareness raising amongst wider publics on the opportunities and threats of making their individual and collective voice heard. Using existing networks, we will engage regularly with donor and government intermediaries to build credibility and establish channels for knowledge sharing and influence. We will enrich public interest debates on ICT and African governance through evidence-based insights on innovations.

2. Collaborations: beyond translation of research findings into end user insights, these will pursue specific policy/practice change and development of practical tools. Working with Internews, an established NGO well experienced in media training including in Africa, from the outset, the research project will reach a wide range of media actors through development of a 'Media public opinion toolkit' for journalists, on aspects such as representative public opinion 101, journalist training on 'reading' public opinion, do no harm, schooling their listenerships and giving voice to the voiceless. Internews' will also organise the first inaugural 'African Media for Citizens' Voice Prize' competition for gathering, sharing and rewarding innovative best practice by broadcast media using ICT interactivity to advance political accountability and social change. 

3. An application pilot that aims to improve media-generated public opinion at scale: CGHR will work on a pilot concept building sub-project with YouGov-Cambridge and FrontlineSMS that draws upon research insights, field-based research presence and media contacts to design, develop and pilot test an improved opinion polling methodology that fills the gap between poor quality media-generated opinion polling and detached and resource-intensive (but rigorous) survey-based research. The benefits of substantially involving broadcast media in pursuing governance accountability through public opinion and the scale and coverage of mobileSMS could be combined, while combining polling techniques and local contextual insights to better tackling marginlisation dynamics and issues of representativeness too often overlooked by media's use of ICT-generated 'public opinion' polling. The tool and methodology developed would be made freely available to organisations seeking to assist raising poor citizens' voice on fundamental governance and development issues.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>246457</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Makerere University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Uganda, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Analysis of socio-cultural dimensions of high maternal mortality and morbidity in Uganda</gtr:description><gtr:id>3668955C-3B6E-4EFD-8F96-1B6C3E3A50E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>While this was only a pilot project, the findings were designed to be practically applicable, and in a format easily digestible and relevant to health practitioners, and local and national policy decision-makers.

In 2015, Africa's Voices Foundation (founded and directed by the project PI, Dr Srinivasan, and with PiMA research associate Dr Claudia Abreu Lopes now Head of Research and Innovation full-time at Africa's Voices) expanded its team and opened a branch office in Nairobi, Kenya. It secured major multi-year funding from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the David and Elaine Potter Foundation. Sir David Green, former Secretary-General of the British Council and Director of VSO, joined Lord Cairns (former Chair of VSO) and others on the board of Trustees. 

Beyond this, given the relatively short time frame since project completion, longer term and sustainable impacts in policy and practice are only in process. However, more immediate impacts, remain important and include: 

1. Improving the skills and capacities of media practitioners: Active engagement throughout the project with media practitioners and policymakers through working with Internews, a project collaborator for impact activities, which guided impact activities through the life of the project. Collaboration with Internews' has been a focal point for impact-oriented activities targeting local media houses and the development community in Kenya and Zambia and across Africa. This involved developing, testing and publishing tools (an expert designed interactive media toolkit; an awareness raising brochure for media, and their donor and governance partners, on the project findings on the value of interactive media for participatory governance) that translate and communicate research to media practitioners in accessible and meaningful ways. Internews and members of the research team continue to disseminate, support and apply the tools developed with media practitioners. 

2. Translating and integrating research methodologies into development and media practice, specifically evaluation and monitoring: Direct practical engagement with radio stations in Africa through the Africa's Voices pilot (funded partly through this grant) provided a platform to help media houses improve their evaluation activities, and its feedback into station practice. With the establishment of the research spin-out charity, Africa's Voices Foundation, a long-term vehicle for impact from PiMA research is guaranteed. Africa's Voices is developing new approaches to citizen engagement, social data analysis and evidence based decision-making. 

Research findings have been integrated into donor initiatives and development programming, initially with the DFID funded BBC Media Action programme, Sema Kenya, a nation-wide TV and radio show that facilitates citizen engagement with high level policy makers and community leaders on current governance issues (e.g. insecurity, devolution). We used research methodologies informed and developed with project research to help them to set up structures to get audience feedback on shows and incorporate this into future programming. We have since developed major partnerships with the DFID funded Well Told Story in Kenya and Tanzania, helping them listen and respond more rigorously to their youth audience, and with UNICEF Somalia, helping their health team unravel socio-cultural beliefs and practices around immunisation and maternal and child health. These impact activities involve PiMA researchers and, now, Africa's Voices Foundation. Further projects on citizens views towards extractive industries and on tax justice for Oxfam Kenya, as well as youth participation in local elections in South Africa for Livity, are enabling translation of projects insights from PiMA into programme design and practical intervention modalities for social change organisations seeking to increase accountability to citizens. 

In 2014, an ESRC Impact Acceleration Account grant enabled PiMA researchers to share insights and develop new methodologies with IBM Research's Africa Lab in Nairobi under a Joint Study Agreement. 

3. Enhancing and expanding 'public knowledge' and debate through public broadcast: We continually sought out in diverse opportunities to present and share research with diverse audiences during the life of the project. This included presentations and workshops with practitioners and policy makers interested in the field of broadcast media at Oxfam East Africa and IBM Research Africa. As well, we disseminated findings to a more diffuse and wide-reaching audience, including, the PI taking part in SOAS World Radio Day 2015 and the BBC World Service programme, The Forum, in a discussion on 'Big Data and Us'. Other presentations and online or webcast interviews included a presentation and rich discussion at the 2014 Voice and Matter Festival (Sweden and Denmark) for development communications practitioners and policymakers, with both researchers and practitioners, online interviews for SciDev.net and an interview for the Centre for Media, Data and Society at the Central European University.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2070B784-A2EC-4E04-9D52-9E2A0EE923D7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Africa's digital revolution continues apace, yet broadcast media are vital for reaching poor and remote populations, and the more marginalised, now and in the foreseeable future. Flourishing interactive broadcast shows are not ideal spaces of democratic politics, yet PiMA has discovered how and why they matter.
1. Why broadcast matters: High levels of audience listenership to interactive shows, and diverse offerings across locations and languages, underscore the importance of taking them seriously. Our household survey research finds that listenership is broad, but participation is skewed towards men who are more educated, somewhat wealthier and slightly younger. Our behavioural data supports this; the ratio of male to female participation is invariably 80:20. Yet a good proportion of women have participated, just less frequently. Interactive shows are perhaps 'biased' discussions, but high listenership levels remind us that they are valued spaces where public opinion is influenced, new voices are heard and socio-demographic groups can get 'socialised' into having a public voice. Our close-range studies of frequent or 'serial' callers, who dominate the airwaves but oftentimes regard themselves as 'citizens' representatives', underscores the old tension between pursuing popular 'inclusion' versus effective 'representation' in democratic politics. 

2. The mediation effect and journalists as enablers: Media actors are central in enabling and constraining the quality and dynamism of interactive discussions, despite the limited social context within which they work. Our station case studies broke down the false binary that often frames African media, as either an ideal watchdog or public sphere, or lamentably caught in the intrigues of their wider political economy. The media is rooted in context, but it also shapes it everyday. Interactive shows reinforce the privileging of particular voices but also create opportunities for new ones. Once access and socio-demographic skews are accounted for, our modelling of survey data, supported by case study and behavioural data, provides strong evidence that factors shaping shows as a social space (e.g. audience perceptions and trust of the show and its host, knowledge of people who participate) have an important role to play. 

3. Interactive broadcasts are dynamic, unconventional spaces for political accountability: Interested audiences, live/engaged public debate, and instrumentalisation and interest by (some) politicians and authorities, apparent through interview and station research, reveal that interactive shows are not trivial, but function as processes of political accountability. Interactive broadcasts are spaces of opportunity, evident in the ways that the shows were seized upon by different actors for different reasons. Shows' popularity and dynamism are also tied to politics, with particular formats - unscripted, immediate and local, or focused on mobilisation and legitimation - driving engagement. Programmatic interventions that recognise what drives the dynamism of interactive shows seize better the broadcast's possibilities. These insights underscored our sharp analysis of why donor-sponsored shows, wedded to mechanistic ideas of political accountability, often fail.

4. New tools and approaches for seizing the power of public opinion: Through their live, dynamic nature, interactive shows become spaces of legitimation and accountability, where public opinion is formed and has political effects at a particular moment. While fragmented and ephemeral, it provides an important opportunity to define and measure public opinion in spaces where it matters. Our research developed new conceptualisations of public opinion in this space, and explored applied methods with which we might measure this approach to public opinion. Research led to the spin-out of a charity, Africa's Voices Foundation, to provide practical tools for gathering and analysing public opinion through interactive shows.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipated impact was best achieved through a multi-pronged approach, incorporated into the research process and supported by dedicated resources. This approach facilitated some exciting directions for impact. 

Academic users: From survey research, we developed and made available online an open access dataset on the characteristics and challenges of audience participation in Kenya and Zambia. We also continue to incorporate research into current scholarly debate in Africa and Europe, presenting at seminars and conferences in Kenya, the UK and Denmark. Publication of a working paper series assists in sharing findings in a timely manner.

Non-academic users: The launch of a spin-out social research charity, from an applied research pilot, is a focal point for the translation and uptake of research in policy and practice. Africa Voices Foundation Ltd. provides momentum and structure for further research and practical application. Africa's Voices is now influencing approaches to citizen engagement and research of development and governance organisations like UNICEF in Somalia, Oxfam in Kenya and others.

Regarding more immediate impacts, collaboration with Internews, an NGO experienced in media training, translated research into resources for practitioners. Internews developed five toolkits for media practitioners in Africa to help improve audience reach and engagement. An 18-page e-book was also created, aimed at station managers, hosts and donors, explaining key findings through illustration and short captions. Sharing resources with stations and online will help ensure their accessibility to users.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7D6503DF-6202-4CF6-BDDC-CC4A763F6D8F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.cghr.polis.cam.ac.uk/research-themes/pdtm/pima</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Interactive radio toolkit for media practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A2917850-D0B0-4958-9A45-68FAAC75D646</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://medium.com/local-voices-global-change/calling-all-listeners-5bdc73636e29#.rezsxx4qu</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Household survey dataset from survey conducted in mid-2013 in four constituencies, one rural and one urban, in Kenya and Zambia as part of the Politics and INternative Media in Africa (PIMA) research project. The survey was designed to supplement other research methods, such as participant observation, key informant interviews and focus-group discussions. The surveys, based on representative samples of citizens of voting age in selected sites in Zambia and Kenya, enabled the research team to provide indicative answers to the first research question: &amp;quot;Which citizens are able to exercise voice using ICTs in media-driven public discussion and opinion-making?&amp;quot; The rationale for conducting the surveys was: (1) to generate demographic information of people who listen to or watch, and text or call-in to radio or television stations; (2) to try to understand the factors which encourage or discourage them from participating; (3) their socio-political attitudes; and (4) their opinions regarding the efficacy of participating in interactive broadcast shows as a way of expressing their political agency or of holding the authorities to account. The surveys in four constituencies in Kenya and Zambia followed the same core methodology, despite some minor adjustments made in order to take context specificities into account. 

In Kenya, the surveys were conducted in Ruaraka: a peri-urban constituency in the capital Nairobi, with mixed demographics including one of the city's major slums; and Seme: a rural constituency settled around Lake Victoria in the country's largely fisher-agricultural community in the western Kenyan city of Kisumu. In Zambia, the surveys were conducted in Mandevu: an urban constituency in the capital city Lusaka with a mixed demographic including some of the city's major slum settlements; and Chipangali: a marginal rural constituency in the country's largely agricultural Eastern Province. The four samples were designed as a representative cross-section of all households in those constituencies. Although no claim is made that the constituencies themselves were representative of the wider national population, they were selected based on the possibility of capturing variation in terms of socio-economic factors, political context and media landscape.

The results of the survey allow inferences to the voting population in the four constituencies (macro-units) with some degree of accuracy (but not to the two countries). The sample sizes are 760 for Kenya (383 for Ruaraka and 377 for Seme) and 688 for Zambia (327 for Mandevu and 361 for Chipangali). The margins of error for a 95% confidence level are no more than plus or minus 5% for both Ruaraka and Seme, 5.41% for Mandevu and 5.12% for Chipangali. The response rate for Kenya was 90.4% (84.6% for Ruaraka and 96.3% for Seme). The response rate for Zambia was not available because the team did not record the number and reasons of unsuccessful calls.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8DCCC42C-A3A0-431D-AF93-A23FD485F893</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under finalisation for making open access</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>PIMA dataset</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Africa's Voices Foundation Ltd</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>Africa's Voices Foundation is a citizen engagement and social data analytics organisation that enables charitable organisations, governance actors and non-charitable organisations pursuing charitable purposes to better understand beneficiary populations needs, feedback on ongoing activities and evaluate interventions.
