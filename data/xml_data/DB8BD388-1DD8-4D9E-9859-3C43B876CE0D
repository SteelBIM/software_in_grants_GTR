Clinical Imaging</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N014588/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Applied Mathematics and Statistics are routinely seen as separate disciplines. However, many of the methodological challenges in image analysis, particularly from the types of multiscale multimodal images available from Neurological, Cardiovascular and Oncology imaging, illustrate that a combined approach, dissolving intradisciplinary mathematical boundaries, is the only possible way forward if a step-change in image analysis of combined data is to occur. This Centre will foster links between applied maths and statistics, particularly high dimensional and functional statistical analysis with applied and computational numerical analysis, through the focus on multimodal imaging data. The Centre proposes to provide a research focus on bringing state-of-the-art mathematical tools to clinical end users through collaborations both within mathematics and between mathematics and healthcare professionals, particularly those in oncology, cardiovascular medicine and neurology. This will ultimately lead to new mathematical frontiers, joining statistics and computational mathematics, as well as a move away from individual image analysis to a holistic approach to all available imaging, from the cellular to systems scale, for clinical diagnosis, prognosis and treatment planning.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre will focus on making an impact within mathematical sciences as well as delivering breakthroughs in image analysis for a number of critical healthcare areas. We will channel efforts of researchers in applied mathematics and statistics to build a common understanding of their (currently disparate) disciplines. Such a shift requires a common focus, and by concentrating efforts on clinical image analysis, such a goal can be realised. The advances generated by the Centre will go well beyond mathematical sciences, to directly influence clinical practice. Mathematicians, statisticians, clinicians and scientists with track records in turning theoretical advances into clinical practice will incorporate the most modern analysis techniques into clinical protocols, taking a multimodal, holistic approach to all available imaging data. By combining imaging data with other clinical covariates such as digitised medical records, clinicians will come to better informed decisions regarding diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options.

We will concentrate on three specific medical areas containing some of the most pressing needs in medicine. Oncology imaging ranges from tumour cell images, to histopathology, to whole organ MRI and PET scans, and we will build models which integrate such disparate data into a single diagnosis or prognosis framework. Cardiovascular imaging has particular issues due to the inherent movement of the heart. We will generate considerably enhanced real time imaging solutions for cardiac imaging, with potential advances, particularly in diagnosis. We will improve on the use of neurological imaging data for diseases such as Alzheimer's and dementia. Moreover, in clinical populations with traumatic brain injury or disorders of consciousness, in-vivo neurological imaging goes beyond simple diagnosis and becomes part of the &amp;quot;treatment&amp;quot;, to interact directly with patients who have little to no other form of communication available. For this we will develop accurate statistical prediction and classification models, along with computational methods, allowing them to be used in real time.

The model of engagement at the heart of the centre will clearly demonstrate the benefits to researchers of working together on problems of mutual interest. Successful collaborations between the physical and clinical sciences require that academic rigour and clinical relevance are well-aligned, with projects selected that offer the potential to develop truly exciting and cutting-edge mathematics, while addressing areas of medicine in which these advances are most needed (rather than only offering incremental clinical benefit). Our model for the co-creation of projects with mathematics and clinical leads is, we believe, fundamental to the development of genuinely challenging and relevant outputs, and will provide a model for these types of engagement in the future. 

Developments in healthcare technology have widespread impacts beyond academic research. Improvements in diagnostic and prognostic tools, and the prospect of integrating real-time image analysis into treatments, can provide a step change in care, improving outcomes and reducing cost. Beneficiaries will include patients, clinicians, hospitals, the NHS (and other healthcare services worldwide) and ultimately taxpayers. Technology companies will benefit from our innovations - both our immediate partners via IP developed as part of the Centre, but also the wider healthcare tech community, through our publications, IP licensing and the open-source software tools we are committed to developing. Our outputs will deliver further academic and economic impact by training high-calibre researchers with expertise and skills relevant to the new cross-disciplinary data science challenges of the 21st century. We will engage early and often with policymakers (e.g. in the Department of Health and NICE), and with the public, demonstrating the deep relevance of mathematics to health.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1923014</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Inspired by our research, a local artist produced a creative reaction to our Pint of Science presentation</gtr:description><gtr:id>EAC7211F-B1E6-4ECC-A744-F8272D296CCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Artist was featured on local TV</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Creative Reactions</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Schlumberger Cambridge Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sparse regularisation for seismic imaging</gtr:description><gtr:id>25C3B66D-B13A-4C3C-A52C-46BC78B12B4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publication in preparation; joint supervision of mathematics students; industrial talk by Evren Yarman to graduate students in mathematics in Cambridge in February 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Know how and funding.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Ongoing collaboration with Dr Evren Yarman on sparse regularisation and optimisation with applications in seismic imaging.

Why? What are the obstacles and opportunities facing them if they do? The path to change is challenging, but there are women out there who can testify that it's possible.

A Women in Data Science event is being held at the Isaac Newton Institute on Wednesday 7 December within the New Developments in Data Privacy workshop, part of the current INI programme on Data Linkage and Anonymisation. 

The event included a Women's Round Table Event and Wine Reception

More details on the programme will be confirmed at a later date.

The workshop is organised by Marcelo Pereyra (Assistant professor, School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot Watt) and Carola-Bibiane Sch&amp;ouml;nlieb (Head of the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information (CCIMI), Cambridge), alongside local organiser Martin Benning (Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge)

The workshop aims to gather an interdisciplinary group of leading imaging experts from the applied analysis, statistics, and signal processing communities around the topic of &amp;quot;imaging with partially unknown models&amp;quot;. The goal is to promote synergy and cross-fertilisation between these communities and set the basis for a multidisciplinary approach to the problem.

Mathematical imaging is at the core of modern data science, with important applications in medicine, biology, defense, agriculture and environmental sciences. This active research field studies imaging inverse problems involving the estimation of an unobserved true image from measurements that are noisy, incomplete and resolution-limited. This proposal focuses on an increasingly important and particularly challenging class of imaging inverse problems that, in addition to being ill-posed and ill-conditioned, are further complicated by inaccurate and partial knowledge of the observation system and of the properties of the underlying true image (which are essential to regularise the problem and deliver meaningful estimates). These so-called &amp;quot;semi-blind&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unsupervised&amp;quot; problems are the focus of significant research efforts across a range of scientific communities, particularly applied analysis, Bayesian statistics, and signal processing, which have recently produced important developments in mathematical theory, methods, models and efficient algorithms.

The proposed research workshop will focus on three specific aspects of imaging with partially unknown models that will be key in future methodology: learning models from observed data, model comparison and selection in the absence of ground truth, and robust inference with approximate models.

Background

We are currently experiencing many new exciting developments in imaging technology in biology and medicine. New advances in tomographic imaging, such as photoacoustic tomography, electron tomography, multicontrast magnetic resonance tomography (MRT) and combined MR with positron emission tomography (PET), as well as new technology in microscopy such as lightsheet microscopy, only mark the beginning of an era which revolutionises the extent of what we can see. New imaging technology always goes side by side with the need of mathematical models to maximise the information gain from these novel imaging techniques. For instance, previously tomographic imaging and light microscopy were separate imaging modalities, which were difficult to cross correlate. However, rapid development of new imaging hardware (light sheet, polarized PET, MRI), is now opening up new avenues for translational multimodal imaging. These developments are supported by sophisticated and rigorous mathematical models, which enhance the information in one imaging modality with information from another.

Aims and Objectives

New imaging technologies however, also bring new challenges to be overcome. In electron tomography for example, the limited angle problem is an intrinsic hardware limitation which results in viewpoint angles in which the imaged specimen cannot be resolved. Dynamic imaging techniques produce huge amounts of image data which require reliable and efficient methods for interpretation and analysis.

This one day meeting aimed to bring together those working on advances in imaging technology with researchers who investigate new image analysis methods, to help address these challenges. In particular, there was a focus on the following topics:

Big data problems and solutions
Multimodality
Dynamic imaging
The workshop facilitated the communication of both current opportunities and challenges of new imaging techniques. It also allowed for the sharing of knowledge on current approaches and solutions of mathematical modelling and analysis approaches, with presentations on industry insights and state-of-the-art mathematical techniques for Big Data Analytics.

This event was of interest to participants from the biomedical imaging industry, mathematics, engineering, computer science and physics, as well as biology and medicine.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.turing-gateway.cam.ac.uk/event/tgmw32</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E99F532-B852-4C3C-8890-A4CDDF8B100C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Launch event was held to celebrate the start of the centre.

Background

Launched in May this year, the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information (CCIMI) is now fully operational with research studentships and a number of exciting collaborative projects underway. Established through philanthropic support of &amp;pound;5 million from Cantab Capital Partners, the Institute accommodates research activity on fundamental mathematical problems and methodology for understanding, analysing, processing and simulating data. The data science research performed in the Institute is at the highest international level, with a key aim to extract relevant information from large and high-dimensional data with a predictable certainty.

The advance of data science and the solution of big data questions heavily relies on fundamental mathematical techniques and in particular, their intra-disciplinary engagement. This is at the heart of the Institute, involving mathematical expertise ranging from statistics, applied and computational analysis, to topology and discrete geometry - all with the common goal of advancing data science questions.

This event provided an opportunity for a more detailed update on current research taking place at the Institute, associated challenges and other potential collaborative opportunities.

 

Aims and Objectives

Current research projects being undertaken by the Institute encompass a variety of activity, from the development of mathematical and statistical tools and techniques for high-dimensional data analysis to hybrid image reconstruction and analysis models. As well as the development of rigorous machine learning methodologies that are accessible by mathematical and statistical analysis techniques. Applications of interest include adaptive image analysis, such as image classification, segmentation and enhancement, all the way to inverse problems in industrial and medical imaging.

This event provided an update to the original launch in May, providing more detailed information on research projects and collaborations, as well as highlighting potential new ones. It featured presentations of some of the current project collaborations.

The Institute currently has 11 projects:

Formation and Adaptation of Biological Transportation Networks
Statistical and Computational Aspects of Aggregating Data Summaries
Mathematics of Machine Learning: Mathematical Learning Methods for Adaptive and Robust Data Analysis
Mixing Times
Denoising Geodesic Ray Transforms
Mathematical challenges in Electron Tomography
Mathematical Challenges of Large Environmental Data Sets
Computational and Statistical Joint Image Analysis
Statistical Applications of Persistent Homology
Bayesian Inference for Discretely Sampled Diffusions - Solving the Nonlinear Inverse Problem
To Create a Semantic Search Engine for Mathematical Literature
For more information on these projects please visit the CCIMI Website.

The Institute's research and projects cover a diverse range of areas across Big Data and so we expect this event to be of interest to individuals from multiple researcher, industry and public communities.

Presentations were followed by a drinks and networking reception and the afternoon finished with a Public Lecture by David Spiegelhalter.

An inverse problem denotes the task of computing an unknown physical quantity from indirect measurements. The corresponding forward problem maps the physical quantity to the measurements. In most realistic situations the solution of the inverse problem is challenging, complicated by incomplete and noisy measurements, as well as non-invertible forward operators which render the inverse problem ill-posed (that is lack of stability and/or uniqueness of solutions). Inverse problems appear in many practical applications in biology, medicine, weather forecasting, chemistry, engineering, physics, to name but a few, and their analysis and solution presents considerable challenges in mathematics and statistics. This conference will bring together mathematicians and statisticians, working on theoretical and numerical aspects of inverse problems, and engineers, physicists and other scientists, working on challenging inverse problem applications. We welcome industrial representatives, doctoral students, early career and established academics working in this field to attend.

Objectives

1) Optimal transport has long standing connections to probability, which have been amplified in recent years. For example, variants of the classical optimal transport problem have arisen in connection to applications in financial mathematics (including transport problems with additional dependence constraints and martingale optimal transport, where versions with several, or even infinitely many, prescribed marginals are also of interest) and Schr&amp;ouml;dinger's problem of minimizing the relative entropy of stochastic processes with fixed initial and final laws. In addition, Wasserstein barycenters have recently been developed as a natural tool to average or interpolate among several probability measures, against the background geometry of optimal transport. This extends the celebrated notion of displacement interpolation between two measures, and has recently found many fruitful applications, in image processing, economics and statistics. Each of these problems brings forth significant new challenges, both theoretical and computational; in addition to addressing these, we have strong reasons to believe that bringing together leaders in optimal transport with experts in probability might uncover even more connections and will stimulate research on both sides.

2) The interest in multi-marginal optimal transport problems is also rapidly growing, driven in particular by its connection with density functional theory in quantum chemistry and fluid dynamics (Brenier's generalized solutions of incompressibe Euler). Understanding the structure, regularity and sparsity properties of optimal plans for multi-marginal transport problems is a very active and challenging area of research. Fast numerical solvers yet are still to be found to address these typically very high-dimensional problems. One of our goals in gathering specialists of optimal transport (both theoretical and computational), probability and statistics in a broad sense is to better understand how, for instance, Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods could help overcome such a computational bottleneck. 

3) As outlined above, OT methods are rapidly developing in statistics and econometrics, one reason-among many others being for instance that the Brenier's map may be viewed as one of the most natural multivariate extensions of the notion of quantile. Statistical inference based on Wasserstein distances is therefore becoming more and more popular. However, there are few rigorous limit theorems (apart from the real line case) which fully justify its use and one aim of this workshop is to make progress on such delicate issues which intimately connect probability, analysis and the geometry of Wasserstein spaces.

4)Representation of datasets, classification and measurement of similarities/disparities between complex data or objects such as images or collection of histograms are ubiquitous problems in machine learning. Optimal transport based distances are used more and more frequently to address these questions. For instance in principal component analysis (PCA) one aims to approximate in the most accurate way a large cloud of points by a small dimensional manifold and geodesic Wasserstein PCA is becoming a popular tool for large collections of histograms. Another important problem is metric learning which can somehow be viewed as a sort of inverse transport problem: what can be infered on the distance between objects given an observed coupling between them? Bringing specialists of questions using optimal transport methods, it is our hope to have a clearer picture and better geometric and analytic understanding on the performances and complexity of computational OT based methods in machine learning.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.birs.ca/events/2017/5-day-workshops/17w5093</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pint of Science</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3931FF50-4E79-4C44-B393-79D3541E87CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Delivered a lecture paired with optics demonstrations to illustrate novel endoscopic imaging to the public</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Naked Scientists</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5DF3061F-26CC-4781-9749-1F8262F2D46D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interviewed live on BBC Radio Cambridgeshire by Naked Scientists about 'using light to fight cancer'; the final programme was then published as a podcast and broadcast internationally</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Big Data Showcase event in Cambridge on Seeing More in Images: A Mathematical Perspective</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>967F3FEA-068D-42C1-8988-9B93EB7C0239</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Background

Mathematics underpins so many things we take for granted - smart phones, weather forecasting, architecture, 3D software, structural engineering, sensing technologies, are just a few examples. Indeed, the fruits of mathematical research - such as the resulting techniques and algorithms, affect the daily lives of everyone and the economic impact of mathematics is already well proven.

The University of Cambridge's Centre for Mathematical Sciences (CMS) and Big Data Initiative, in partnership with the Turing Gateway to Mathematics highlighted areas of research and expertise in a showcase event, that took place on Wednesday 20th April 2016 at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences in Wilberforce Road, Cambridge.

A wide range of talks were given by leading researchers, highlighting areas of mathematical and Big Data sciences. An exhibition ran during the lunch break and the afternoon session. The day ended with a drinks and networking reception between 5.00-6.00PM.

The Showcase presented a great opportunity to see what Cambridge has to offer and better understand the diversity and impact that the research in mathematics and big data at Cambridge can make on business and policy across a wide range of areas. Researchers were on hand to discuss specific areas of maths and big data and there was opportunities for delegates to take tours of the GK Batchelor Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and also see the COSMOS Computer. The exhibition included research groups, industrial case studies posters, the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Analysis, the new Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information and details of project opportunities for industry.

Aims and Objectives

Subjects of talks included industrial areas such as materials and chemical decontamination, mathematical biology, financial maths, cosmology, communications and social sciences. The Showcase presented an excellent opportunity to bring together scientists from mathematics and other disciplines such as physics, chemistry, engineering etc, with interested parties from industry, government and public sectors.

The Showcase gave participants a great opportunity to:

Meet leading mathematicians and other scientists involved in state-of-the-art mathematical techniques and methods across multiple areas including Big Data
Learn more about the potential of mathematics to help provide solutions to real-world problems
Find out how to collaborate and partner with the University through research, projects and studentships

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile imaging technique that allows different contrasts depending on the acquisition parameters. Many clinical imaging studies acquire MRI data for more than one of these contrasts---such as for instance T1 and T2 weighted images---which makes the overall scanning procedure very time consuming. As all of these images show the same underlying anatomy one can try to omit unnecessary measurements by taking the similarity into account during reconstruction. We will discuss two modifications of total variation---based on i) location and ii) direction---that take structural a priori knowledge into account and reduce to total variation in the degenerate case when no structural knowledge is available. We solve the resulting convex minimization problem with the alternating direction method of multipliers that separates the forward operator from the prior. For both priors the corresponding proximal operator can be implemented as an extension of the fast gradient projection method on the dual problem for total variation. We tested the priors on six data sets that are based on phantoms and real MRI images. In all test cases exploiting the structural information from the other contrast yields better results than separate reconstruction with total variation in terms of standard metrics like peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index. Furthermore, we found that exploiting the two dimensional directional information results in images with well defined edges, superior to those reconstructed solely using a priori information about the edge location.</gtr:description><gtr:id>320C16C3-CD99-4A84-9C8B-C62F6CF9A8A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Software for joint-reconstruction for multi contrast MRI</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction with Structure-Guided Total Variation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/software/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Citation
