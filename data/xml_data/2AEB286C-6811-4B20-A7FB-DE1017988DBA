New materials often display unique properties that suggest new ways of solving important societal problems such as making better catalysts or the development of new sensors for medical or environmental applications. The development of graphene is a prominent example of a new material that redefined existing applications and in many cases suggested entirely new ones. A proven approach to developing new materials is to combine different structures to form composite materials where the properties of multiple materials can be combined in a single structure. In addition to simply combining the properties of individual materials, composite materials often lead to entirely new properties that surpass those of either of the components.

To discover new composite materials we need to understand how they form and utilise this knowledge to grow complex materials that can be designed to have desirable properties. This project aims to combine two promising types of materials into new composite structures: porous graphene materials and two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D-COFs). 2D-COFs are formed by linking separate molecular building blocks together with covalent bonds to create extended two-dimensional molecular structures. The 2D-COFs studied in this project are surface supported porphyrin 2D-COFs. This means the growth of the 2D-COF takes places on an underlying surface and the main molecular components are porphyrin molecules. Porphyrins are highly versatile and widely used organic molecular components. The potential of porphyrins to provide chemical functionality is demonstrated by their important roles in biological systems, photosynthesis and binding oxygen in red blood cells and technologically in catalysts and sensors.

I will use an experimental tool called a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to track the growth of 2D-COFs on porous graphene materials in real-time. Porphyrin 2D-COFs will be grown using a condensation reaction to form the covalent links between molecules. These condensation reactions release water molecules and the mass change associated with this can be detected by QCM. These in-situ measurements will allow us to gain insights into how environmental conditions, such as temperature pressure and humidity, influence the growth of 2D-COF structures. Using these insights I will find optimal conditions for 2D-COF growth and the project will investigate the growth on high surface area graphene materials such as graphene foams and graphene hydrogels.

A major obstacle to the application of 2D-COFs is their lack of stability in harsh conditions. To produce ordered 2D-COFs it is necessary to use covalent bonds that link molecules together reversibly. If bonds are non-reversible defects in the growing 2D-COF become trapped and disordered structures are produced. However, a limitation to using reversible bond formation processes is that while the resulting 2D-COFs are ordered they are also susceptible to degradation, making them unsuitable for applications that require stability in harsh environments. This project aims to develop post-growth chemical treatments that increase the stability of pre-formed porphyrin 2D-COFs while maintaining their ordered structure. Finally, an approach to adding functionality to pre-formed 2D-COFs by using custom designed molecular building blocks will also be investigated. These building blocks will have chemical groups which are inactive during 2D-COF growth but subsequently can be used to attach other functional components, such as dye molecules or nanoparticles, to the preformed 2D-COFs. This modular approach use 2D-COFs as templates for producing complex and functional materials.

This project will lead to a new understanding in the growth of functional organic nanostructures and a new set of composite materials with potential in a wide range of applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In addition to the academic beneficiaries listed previously I have identified three groups of beneficiaries of the proposed project:

1. Industrial companies with interests in catalysts or electrode design:
The successful implementation of the research in this proposal will produce a range of new composite materials consisting of porphyrin two-dimensional covalent-organic frameworks (2D-COFs) supported on high specific surface area graphene based materials. After demonstrating the growth of these porphyrin 2D-COFs on the graphene based materials I will go on to investigate methods to increase their chemical and thermal stability. Making the porphyrin 2D-COFs stable under harsher environments (e.g. higher temperatures and acidic environments) is a key step toward developing these structures as potential catalytic materials. Porphyrins have previous been utilised as the active components in catalysts and as electro-catalysts. In addition to this, high specific surface area graphene based materials have been shown to be highly effective materials as catalytic supports and as electrodes. The new materials produced in this project would have significant impact for companies interested in these applications by providing both new materials and new fabrication processes. An example of such a company that already has links to UCL through the UK Catalysis Hub is Johnson Matthey.

2. High tech companies / defence agencies with interests in the design of new sensors:
Core themes of the proposed research in this project are the development of a deeper understanding of the factors that influence 2D-COF growth and new experimental techniques to control their structure and, as a result, their functionality. I will design 2D-COF structures that have chemical groups, such as thiols or alkynes, which are dormant during the growth of the structure but that can be subsequently used to attach other functional entities. This modular approach to functionalising 2D-COFs is a major step forwards in controlling the properties and thereby the functionality of these structures. Such a level of control would be of particular interest to high tech companies and defence agencies, such as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), interested in the design of novel sensing devices. A prominent example would be those interested in detecting volatile, high energy organic compounds such as explosives. Porphyrins possess many desirable attributes as components in sensing devices, particularly binding to organic nitro-compounds common in explosives. Being able to control the arrangement of porphyrins in relation to other functional objects, such as dye molecules or nanoparticles, will lead to numerous nanostructured architectures with potential for sensing. The impact of this aspect of the proposed research will be maximised by collaboration with industrial or public sector partners via the UCL SECReT (Security Science Doctoral Research Training Centre) programme.

3. The general public:
The PI for the proposed research has a proven track record of public engagement. The research in this project provides an ideal opportunity to demonstrate the important role played by the physical sciences in the development of new materials and technologies. As detailed in the proposal the PI will add to his portfolio of outreach activities by developing a range of new presentations on the subjects of two-dimensional materials and organic nanostructures, with a focus on how the goals of the proposed project make use of these types of structures. These presentations will then be delivered to a range of audiences including school groups and the general public. A key objective of the programme of outreach would be to develop a display on graphene and other 2D based nanomaterials for free public events such as the Bloomsbury Festival (http://bloomsburyfestival.org.uk/about-the-festival/).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99876</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pint of Science 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3239C30-CDA2-4359-B38C-67D257E1E3D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Pint of Science festival aims to deliver interesting and relevant talks on the latest science research in an accessible format to the public - mainly across bars and pubs. Pint of Science want to provide a platform which allows people to discuss research with the people who carry it out and no prior knowledge of the subject is required. It is run mainly by volunteers and was established by a community of postgraduate and postdoctoral researchers in 2012. In May 2015 I gave a lecture on the use of scanning probe microscopy to study two-dimensional molecular materials. The presentation was one of two related talks, the other given by another researcher from the Department of Chemistry at UCL. The audience was the general public (approx 40-50) people. After the presentations there was a chance for the audience to ask questions in an informal atmosphere. This sparked numerous discussions and raised interest and awareness of subject material.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://pintofscience.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8386D78C-7A32-4DA5-9B19-A23DF56E6488"><gtr:id>8386D78C-7A32-4DA5-9B19-A23DF56E6488</gtr:id><gtr:title>Probing the chemical structure of monolayer covalent-organic frameworks grown via Schiff-base condensation reactions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/138f33a3f01c841c7c7260f7700fecd5"><gtr:id>138f33a3f01c841c7c7260f7700fecd5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hu Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/N021789/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64596636-AE88-4F6E-A816-9C4C203E1197</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Catalysis &amp; surfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>99E0B904-CAB5-4511-AFB3-AA6D2B171F97</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Process engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>454398F2-57A6-4959-8845-0F248CF4D5C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Synthetic Methodology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>063026C5-CD0B-48AB-82F3-6359499A95D4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Synthesis &amp; Growth</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B502FBF6-8A62-4845-B561-BAB94EAA09E9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reactor Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C89BB7D-DCEF-4DCF-84DB-CA53C907AB0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>15</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Surfaces &amp; Interfaces</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
