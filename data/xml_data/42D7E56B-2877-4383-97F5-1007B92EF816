For such individuals, labour market prospects are poor and the risk of poverty is high.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Random assignment demonstrations in Britain and Texas have trialled the use of time-limited financial bonuses as a means of encouraging employment retention for benefit recipients entering work.These demonstrations found evidence of positive employment effects. However, they do not identify whether this is due to more people entering work or people remaining longer in work.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study uses an econometric duration model to separately identify the employment entry effect and the employment retention effect. Using unique data from the British and Texan experiments, the analysis will be carried out for long-term unemployed people (Britain only) and lone parents (Britain and Texas).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will also explore the extent to which direct comparisons can be made across the countries, with the aim of understanding what impact the Texas model might have had in Britain and, conversely, what impact the British model might have had in Texas.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed study builds on large-scale evaluations that have been funded by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in the UK and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Labor (DOL) in the US. Consequently, these departments have an immediate interest in the project. The results of the analysis will provide insights into the effect of time-limited earnings supplements on employment retention. Very little evidence exists on this internationally so policy makers in other countries may also find the results of the analysis informative, particularly if there is some evidence of common effects across the UK and Texas.

Equipping policy-makers with high-quality information increases the likelihood that labour market policy can be developed in such a way that the 'low pay, no pay' cycle is broken. If it can assist the formulation of appropriate policy in this way, the research may prove beneficial ultimately to those individuals and families with only a weak attachment to the labour market. If policy can be effectively developed in order to increase their employment retention and consequently their resilience in work, significant benefits will result, for example: improved employment prospects, greater earnings, more rewarding work, higher standard of living and improved social mobility. Benefits felt at the broader level would include a more efficient labour market and a more skilled workforce, as individuals increase their experience and knowledge.

The work has the potential to have an immediate and long-lasting impact on policy. The applicant and his US partners have a long history of working with the DWP, the HHS and the DOL. In order to raise the profile of the research with UK policy-makers, a seminar at DWP will be arranged, with H.M. Treasury and other interested departments invited. The research will also be presented at the Work and Pensions Labour Economics conference (which is sponsored by the DWP) in order to disseminate more broadly across interested government officials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77424</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited seminar at the Danish National Centre for Social Research, Copenhagen.

The interest in this question stems from the fact that if individuals can be helped to stay longer in work, they can gain valuable work experience, acquire new skills, increase their earnings, enjoy greater employment stability and so on. If, on the other hand, increased overall employment resulted largely from increased employment entry, ERA would have done little to address the low-pay no-pay cycle. 

In the UK, ERA was found to increase unemployment exit but not to affect retention. Prolonged unemployment spells can damage longer-term prospects. By shortening unemployment spells, ERA had a more prolonged effect on the long-term unemployed (Dorsett, 2014)

The US trials were in Corpus Christi and Forth Worth. In Corpus Christi, the sustained positive impact on employment was due to both employment retention and employment entry effects but the retention effect faded over time. In Fort Worth, there were smaller effects. There was some indication that employment retention might have been improved, but only in the short-term (Dorsett, Hendra and Robins, 2014). 

Comparing lone parents in the UK and the US, the larger impacts in the US cannot be explained by differences in observed characteristics. Rather, unobserved characteristics appear important; ERA worked better for those who would otherwise be slower to enter work and less well for those who would otherwise be slower to leave work. The fact that these groups are present in different proportions in Texas and the UK accounts for much of the difference in observed impacts. 

We also found that, in the UK, ERA impacts were greater in offices that emphasised in-work advancement, support while working and financial bonuses for sustained employment, and also in those offices that assigned more caseworkers to ERA participants. Offices that encouraged further education
had smaller employment impacts (Dorsett and Robins, 2014).

We provide some evidence that providing temporary support in this way may harm well-being in the long-run (Dorsett and Oswald, 2014).

Lastly, we have examined the sensitivity of experimental results to the data used to estimate impacts. We have explored why estimates based on survey data can give different results from those based on administrative data and, in doing so, have highlighted the need to pay attention to the possibility that data features may influence the statistical properties of an RCT.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results provide some guidance for the development of policy. They highlight the difficulty of increasing retention. However, ERA-type interventions have been shown to have positive impacts. The findings identify particular features of ERA in the UK that were associated with effectiveness. The results caution that such interventions may have unexpected negative impacts on well-being. This is an important finding and suggests that relevant evidence from other studies should be examined. Lastly, our exploration of data issues highlights the need for those carrying out experiments to pay close attention to the characteristics of the underlying data.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6490DE29-B379-4FC1-B3F7-D23FE79FDBC5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2B8B1FE3-2B4F-4F87-A4B6-247544E1E329"><gtr:id>2B8B1FE3-2B4F-4F87-A4B6-247544E1E329</gtr:id><gtr:title>The effect of temporary in-work support on employment retention: evidence from a field experiment</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Labour Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9930af89ec0c38f73424a166e7811559"><gtr:id>9930af89ec0c38f73424a166e7811559</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dorsett R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7EA31705-14E8-4A05-806E-0F8D126880D1"><gtr:id>7EA31705-14E8-4A05-806E-0F8D126880D1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Can Post-Employment Services Combined with Financial Incentives Improve Employment Retention for Welfare Recipients?
