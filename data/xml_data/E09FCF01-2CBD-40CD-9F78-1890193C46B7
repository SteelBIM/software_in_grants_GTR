&lt;p>Typically, adults from all cultures and backgrounds can accurately anticipate short-term events, can catch objects thrown to them, and can perform the enormous range of human activities that require timing.This universality may seem to imply that the sense of time does not rely on learning, a position implicitly taken by the well-known pacemaker-accumulator models and multiple-oscillator/coincidence-detection models of time perception. But there are problems with these models, among them, the problem of resetting the system for every event for which a time judgment might later be required. Recently, the reset problem has been avoided by suggesting that time perception depends on memory-trace decay.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will explore a novel memory-trace model of the early development time perception in which learning and coordinated motor activity in infancy both play a key role.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This hypothesis is explored through a combination of rigorous experimental behavioral studies of infants developing time perception, measurements of muscular electrical activity used an implicit measure of infant time keeping, and computational neural network modeling of the emerging ability.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>423182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IntoUniversity A-level Lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCE88534-15FC-4006-A583-322F18B6870E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk sparked interest in A-level students not normally represented in higher education

The key idea was that our subjective experience of time is grounded in early motor activity. We propose that there is no central timekeeping mechanism in the brain. Instead, time is related to the rate at which activation traces in the brain decay. This rate of decay is then calibrated against durations of external events to give rise to the sense of time passing. The project also consisted in developing new computational models of this process. The project was funded through the ORA international collaboration scheme.

As for all basic research, it sometimes takes years for the work to filter through to non-academic end-users. The current work is beginning to have impact through public dissemination events. For example, it was picked up and made the subject of a documentary produced by the Canadian Discovery Channel Dailey Planet programme. The programme's viewership during this series peaked at 2 million viewers (http://www.bellmedia.ca/pr/press/daily-planet-ratings-release/), with that episode featuring in the programmes top 100 most popular episodes. 

The Polka Dot Theatre (www.polkatheatre.com/) in Wimbeldon, South London, has adopted the work on rhythm perception in infants as part of its forthcoming &amp;quot;Theatre for under 2s&amp;quot; season. They will be working closely with the former researchers on this ESRC project to develop an interactive theatrical experience for parents and infants in their forthcoming season as part of their Festival of Childhood. 

The project has had immediate economic impact insofar as both postdoctoral researchers employed (here and in France) have gone on to fulltime employment as faculty in academia, as has the pre-doctoral research assistant.

This collaborative project involved a long-term colleague in France (Robert French) and the creation fop a new link (Elizabeth Thomas) with whom the UK lab had not previously worked. This new collaboration is continuing, and while a request for additional funding from the ESRC was not met, the team are putting together applications to other funding sources to continue this line of work. Note that the EMG apparatus funded in part by the grant was mentioned as part of the expertise and infrastructre available at the CBCD in a successful ?500,000 grant from the European Commission, thereby bringing resources into the UK.

The primary researcher was invited to present the team's work on sequence processing at a special international workshop in San Sebastian, Spain, and this has lead to a further invitation to submit a manuscript extending the work funded by the ESRC to a special issue of the Proceedings of the Royal Society. 

In sum, the impact of this project is only just beginning to emerge. Our activities are consistent with what was described in the &amp;quot;Pathways to Impact&amp;quot; part of the submission. We expect impact to continue as the work filters from the basic science world to the translational world. One area that we anticipate more impact is in the area of robotic design. This joint project should also improve chance of further funding form such sources as the European Commission to continue the international collaboration between the French and British teams.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>61603819-EA2F-48BD-86C7-AE3D4386AD10</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project combined infant behavioural testing, measurement of electrical activity in muscles, and computational modelling to investigate the origins of infant time keeping and to test the hypothesis that our ability to keep track of short time intervals is initially grounded in repetitive actions during infancy.

To this end, we completed a series of studies exploring infants' use of temporal information and its relation to motor activity. In one study (Addyman &amp;amp; Mareschal, 2013) we found that 5-month-olds spontaneously differentiate temporally structured from unstructured sequences of visual events. This is important because it establishes that infants build up expectations about stimuli structured in time. However, these studies only assessed infants' sensitivity to temporal structure and not their ability to predict up and coming events. In a second series of studies (Addyman, Rocha &amp;amp; Mareschal, 2014), we developed a novel eye-tracking method for the assessing the accuracy of infant temporal expectations. In this work, we were able to assess when infants expected something to occur, rather than simply responding to something that did not occur. Here, we found that 4-, 6-, 8- and 10-month-olds not only expected events to occur at predictable times, but that their temporal prediction errors followed the same logarithmic growth as those of adults. 

In collaboration with our French partners, we established in adults that regular motor activity improved interval timing (Fautrelle et al., in press). This was not due to simple motor preparation but rather was symptomatic of a close coupling of the motor and interval timing systems as we had hypothesised. A series of experiments measuring behaviour and muscle activity with 4- and 8-month-olds further revealed that 8-month-olds show subthreshold anticipatory activity (anticipatory EMG potentials) in temporally predictive tasks (even when there is no overt evidence of movement) (Addyman et al., in prep a). This is true both in tasks that involve a motor response and in ones where only passive viewing of a regularly timed stimulus is required. This series of studies established anticipatory EMGs as a potential subthreshold marker of infant planning and timing. One final series of studies with 4- to 14-month-olds explored the possible association between the level of motor development and stability of motor development with individual differences in infants' timing accuracy (Addyman et al, in prep b). The hypothesis here was that infants with more regular/stable motor activity would be more accurate in their timing of tasks, even if these do not require an overt motor action. During this study, we also collected measures of short-term memory capacity and level of motor development. 

Finally, we explored 10- and 14-month-olds' movement entrainment to temporally predictable (rhythmic) auditory signal - &amp;quot;moving to the beat&amp;quot;. Although there is some evidence of entrainment in these infants, we found that it was readily overridden by the presence of strong social cues. 

Finally in collaboration with the French partners, we have developed 3 computational models of infant time processing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work on infant time perception has formed the basis of a documentary by the Canadian Discovery Channel. In this way, it improves the general public's understanding of child development.

We have proposed a novel form of time keeping based on decaying memory activation traces which contrasts with the prevailing &amp;quot;internal clock&amp;quot; view. Decaying activation traces are ubiquitous in neural computational systems. This this novel timekeeping mechanism has potential to be taken up by the robotics community (both academic and commercial) in developing event-based time keeping for artificial cognitive systems.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1D605599-A99C-42E2-B5AC-F4C354A35138</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>More people use Contec Pulse Oximeters</gtr:description><gtr:id>1C8C97EF-0554-4A80-AC95-91918379B921</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Matlab code to collect real time data from Contec Pulse Oximeters (Heart rate monitor).
