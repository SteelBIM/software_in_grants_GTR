theory</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/J007064/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The natural world is filled with examples of signalling or communication between individuals. Males attract females with showy ornaments or repel rivals with loud roars, offspring beg from their parents, ants release chemicals to coordinate foraging behaviours and poisonous caterpillars warn their predators away with bright colours.

Although the advantages of signalling may seem obvious, it actually poses a problem for evolutionary theory. The problem is why don't individuals lie or exaggerate, to their own benefit. For example, why don't all male peacocks signal that they are the best quality mate, or why don't all chicks signal that they are the hungriest? Put simply, what keeps signals honest? If signals were dishonest, then the best strategy would be to ignore them, and so the signalling system would be lost.

Evolutionary theory has proposed a number of ways in which signals could be kept honest, and there is an excellent empirical literature on this, examining traits that range from birds tails, to facial markings in wasps, to the roars of deer, to eyespan of flies, to begging in chicks. However, the nature of working on signalling in animals limits what kinds of experiments are possible.

Here we will take advantage of the fact that bacteria signal to each other, to coordinate cooperative behaviours, in order to test very general theory about how signalling will evolve. We will manipulate factors such as the extent to which honesty is favoured, block signalling, enhance signalling and then follow the evolutionary consequences. Furthermore, because we are working on bacteria, we can follow the consequences at all levels from the behaviour to the gene.

Overall, our aim is to examine how the social and ecological environment influences the evolution of communication. This work is not an alternative to working on animals, but rather a complementary way to get at different aspects of the same questions.

Furthermore, our work has potential medical consequences, because bacterial signalling controls the behaviours that determine how well pathogenic bacteria grow, how virulent they are in their hosts, and how well they resist antibiotics. Consequently, by examining the consequences for these pathogenic behaviours, we will also collect data that is a necessary first step in determining whether signalling can be exploited as a medical intervention strategy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is a multidisciplinary project empirically testing fundamental principles of signalling theory. The project combines molecular expertise with evolutionary theory and this enables us, for the first time, to experimentally test how signalling systems evolve over a number of generations. The use of bacteria as a model system allows us to manipulate signalling in a way that is not possible with more traditional study organisms (e.g. birds and mammals). 

The major impact of the work will be the research output, and the work will be of interest to the fields of microbiology, animal behaviour and evolutionary biology. The work will provide new insights into signalling systems and the mechanisms behind them, and will complement and enhance the body of work already performed in the animal field.

Quorum sensing regulates virulence in our organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and so our work will also have applied consequences and be of interest to applied microbiologists and clinicians. Demonstrating how signalling systems evolve will provide unique insights into infection, and how virulence and antibiotic resistance can develop.

The project will provide excellent training for a post-doctoral researcher who will benefit greatly from multidisciplinary collaborative research and who will receive training in paper writing, a wide variety of methodologies and experimental design and analysis. They will also be encouraged to apply for an independent fellowship at the end of the project. 

We will aim to publicise our findings in a timely manner in high quality international ranked journals to maximize the impact of the research as well as presenting the work at major international conferences. 

We will also disseminate the research on our personal and university websites. Where possible we will engage in public communication such as television and radio programmes and popular science magazines. 

The sequence and transcriptomic data generated will be deposited with EMBL/Genbank and also be used to update genome annotations in public databases such as National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and The Pseudomonas Genome Project. This will provide invaluable information for scientists working on all aspects of Pseudomonas biology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-07</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>369416</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ancientbiotics</gtr:description><gtr:id>A6585DF5-F60A-4613-AE02-6EA27895AAD2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The successful pilot study into Bald's 'Eye-Salve' generated a major interest, both in academia but also in the media and general public. Our paper is in the top 5% of all papers ever featured on altmetrics (http://www.altmetric.com/details/4383375?src=bookmarklet). By April 2015 it had one billion plus internet views worldwide with 46,289,198 shares across the internet in April 2015). Aside from medical newsletters, it was featured in all major broadsheets (including the Guardian) in the UK, US and Canada, and TV and Radio stations (including CNN, Fox, BBC, ABC). It was picked up by the BBC Today programme (March 2015) and on the BBC PM programme in December 2015. A 30 minute documentary was featured on Radiolab in the US in November 2015: http://www.radiolab.org/story/best-medicine/. In October 2015 it appeared on the BBC Health website http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34616695 and the Al-Jazeera website (January 2016). There is still ongoing interest in the project. Our project was described in as diverse publications as Playboy, National Geographic and the New Scientist in 2015. It appeared as a news item on every inhabited continent in the world. 
 
We have presented our work to colleagues at several academic conferences in both Arts and Sciences. We have also given talks at learned societies, such as the East Midlands branch of the Royal Society for Chemists, and in museums and public engagement events such as the Festival of Humanities. What is perhaps the most important and pleasing aspect of our work is that we have been approached by a range of schools to speak to students or to help with teaching materials. This quote is from one head of sixth form after hearing us on Radiolab: 'One of my responsibilities to my students is to give breadth as well as depth of education, and that isn't always the easiest thing to do to 17- and 18-year olds who are expected to specialise all the more narrowly as they progress through their schooling I thought [that] both of you exemplified what it means to follow passions and interests that go beyond jobs and titles. It's also an incredible story that unifies the traditional split between arts and sciences, and provides a narrative that I think can engage them and teach them something beyond the textbook.'

The research was very multidisciplinary. Thom Scott Phillips is a linguist and so he provided all the language theory and we tested this in the lab with bacteria. The abstract of the paper is below. 

Combinatorial communication, in which two signals are used together to achieve an effect that is different to the sum of the effects of the component parts, is apparently rare in nature: it is ubiquitous in human language, appears to exist in a simple form in some non-human primates, but has not been demonstrated in other species. This observed distribution has led to the pair of related suggestions, that (i) these differences in the complexity of observed communication systems reflect cognitive differences between species; and (ii) that the combinations we see in non-human primates may be evolutionary pre-cursors of human language. Here we replicate the landmark experiments on combinatorial communication in non-human primates, but in an entirely different species, unrelated to humans, and with no higher cognition: the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using the same general methods as the primate studies, we find the same general pattern of results: the effect of the combined signal differs from the composite effect of the two individual signals. This suggests that advanced cognitive abilities and large brains do not necessarily explain why some species have combinatorial communication systems and others do not. We thus argue that it is premature to conclude that the systems observed in non-human primates are evolutionarily related to language. Our results illustrate the value of an extremely broad approach to comparative research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They provided all the intellectual input on linguistics.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In this multidisciplinary project we contributed the experimental side.

With flagship radio coverage, we also gave interviews to New Scientist and BBC Health. 

On the 30th March the floodgates opened and BBC Online alone reported 1.4m hits in 2 days and the global media response was phenomenal. The story went viral and trended on both Facebook and Twitter and was shared by New Scientist (1.58m followers, CNN (3.4m followers) and even Playboy (1m followers). There were countless media requests and it featured in most of the worlds major newspapers and news outlets. 

We believe there were over 1 billion hits on the internet and 47m shares across international print, online and social media. In November 2015, the US public radio show 'Radiolab' featured the story in a full half hour special. This gave the story another boost in public and media interest. 

There was too much media activity to list everything here. A google search for 'ancientbiotics' or &amp;quot;Bald's Leechbook' will give an idea how far and wide the story became.

This poses an evolutionary problem, because individuals could potentially signal dishonestly to coerce others into behaving in a way that benefits the signaller. Theory suggests that honest signalling is favoured when individuals share a common interest and signals carry reliable information. However, whilst many studies have manipulated signals, to examine how this influences behaviour, it has not been possible to directly test how the behaviour of signallers and receivers evolve in response to manipulation. Here, we exploit the opportunities offered by signalling between bacteria ('quorum sensing') to show that: (1) a reduced relatedness, and therefore reduced common interest between interacting individuals, leads to the relative breakdown of signalling, via both reduced signalling and a reduced response to signal; (2) signal interference selects for lower levels of signalling. More generally, whilst our results provide clear support for signalling theory, we did not find evidence for the previously predicted coercion at intermediate relatedness, suggesting that mechanistic details can alter even the qualitative nature of specific predictions. Furthermore, the populations evolved under a lower relatedness caused less mortality and damage to insect hosts, showing how signal evolution leads to strain diversity influencing the evolution of virulence in the opposite direction to that usually predicted by theory.

We have also developed an ex vivo pig lung model that can be used to grow bacterial populations in spatially structured tissue. This model will allow researchers to test how bacterial populations evolve in more realistic environments and have an impact on the NC3Rs due to a reduction in animal use. It will be a useful model to screen the effect of new antimicrobial drugs on bacteria growing in tissue. 

We identified a recipe against an eye-infection (sty) from a tenth-century Anglo-Saxon Leechbook (medical manuscript) and re-created and tested it in the modern laboratory. We chose this recipe because stys are most likely caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which includes the infamous multi drug-resistant MRSA strain. Treatment costs the NHS more than &amp;pound;500 million annually (source: Microbiology Society) and is a persistent cause of misery to people who are affected, since it is painful and hard to cure. We discovered that the remedy kills not only 99.9% of S. aureus cells, but more importantly, also kills MRSA more efficiently than the current last line of defence (Vancomycin) in a mouse wound model.

Since Anglo-Saxon medical recipes do not give quantities, we had a number of obstacles to solve: The recipe contains wine - red or white? One of the ingredients (cropleac) is unknown - how do we solve this? Most fascinating is that the recipe asks for the remedy to be left for 9 nights to mature and it indeed takes this time to become fully active. Such facts challenge our perceptions of medieval medicine as 'backwards', since we now believe that the recipe was 'designed' and based on empirical observation and testing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Signalling systems in bacteria (i.e.: quorum sensing) are often directly linked to the regulation of toxin production and virulence. Understanding how and why signalling systems evolve in bacteria will help us understand the biology of infection in greater detail and will potentially lead to new compounds and systems to interfere with bacterial signalling during infection. Reducing virulence would be the key aim here and such new approaches are crucial in this current era of increasing antibiotic resistance. Our experimental work studying how signalling evolves in bacteria is relevant to theory on signalling in higher organisms such as birds and mammals. Therefore our findings will be of direct interest to scientists working on signalling systems in a wide range of animals.

Our ex vivo pig lung model can be used by a range of researchers working on chronic infections and who are interested in testing the efficacy of new antimicrobial compounds in spatially structured tissue.

Our work on ancientbiotics has opened a potentially new field in searching old texts for recipes to treat bacterial infections. With the problem of antimicrobial resistance, these texts could be valuable resources of the future. This work has also been a great example of where the sciences and humanities can work together to do something new. There has been a huge interest from the general public and schools around the world. Some schools are even building recipes in their classes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>37A508E0-50DD-47FA-9ADD-6B14B08B42EE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.stevediggle.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for quantifying Pseudomonas aeruginosa growth, quorum sensing (QS), virulence factor production, and tissue damage in an environment that mimics a chronically infected cystic fibrosis (CF) lung.

Research into chronic infection by bacterial pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, uses various in vitro and live host models. While these have increased our understanding of pathogen growth, virulence, and evolution, each model has certain limitations. In vitro models cannot recapitulate the complex spatial structure of host organs, while experiments on live hosts are limited in terms of sample size and infection duration for ethical reasons; live mammal models also require specialized facilities which are costly to run.
