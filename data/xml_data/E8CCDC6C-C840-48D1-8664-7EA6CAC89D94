As the older working population rises, due to both aging population demographics and increasing retirement age, an increasing number of digital economy workers will require to use mobile technologies for work into their mid/late 60s. 

The proposed European Accessibility Act aims to require goods and services that are seen as critical for the citizen to participate in society to be accessible to disabled and older people - this is likely to cover information and communication technologies including mobile phones. Age UK encourage the UK Government to support the act and state that the EU must ensure that the scope of the act is broad enough to cover the needs of older people. 

Text entry is core to mobile interaction such as email, social networking, instant messaging and interacting with services such as web or map searching and thus it is increasingly important to people's participation in work and society. The majority of smartphones now do not have any physical keyboard but rely on on-screen touch keyboards. These have been shown to be slower and more error-prone than traditional mini-physical keyboards, but are popular as they permit full screen services and larger reading area. 

While there have been numerous studies into text entry usage on touchscreens, there has been very little work studying the effects of aging on text entry, and none on modern touchscreen phones where reduced visual acuity, reduced motor control and reduced working memory are all likely to have an impact. Currently industry is focussed on targeting the current main market of younger users with any devices designed for older users being extremely simplified phones rather than powerful smartphones people are becoming accustomed to. Our initial studies have also shown that older users have considerable trouble with modern smartphones but may be willing to adopt new keyboard layouts and technologies to compensate for this.

In this project we will conduct a detailed investigation into text entry for older adults. We will build on our initial results and current prototype keyboards to conduct participatory design sessions with older users to identify key design criteria for older adult text entry. We will quantitatively measure touchscreen tapping times for different age groups and develop accidental tap filters to reduce errors. We will formally evaluate keyboards based on our findings to assess our hypothesis that older people can successfully use appropriately designed touch-screen text entry methods.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 2000 Foresight report on the age shift stated that we &amp;quot;can anticipate changes caused by population ageing and adapt our behaviour to avoid potential problems&amp;quot;. They recommended that &amp;quot;research into assistive technologies and inclusive design should be encouraged&amp;quot; and that &amp;quot;research programmes should be expanded to provide qualitative and quantitative data about the needs, wants and capabilities of older people&amp;quot;. 

This project will investigate text entry on smartphones for older users. It has the potential to have a considerable impact on the ability of older users to use smartphones and to enable currently younger users to continue using their smartphones when effects of older age become noticeable. Given increasing retirement ages and increasing use of smartphones for both work and social life, this could have a major impact on personal wellbeing and the UK economy. Furthermore, upcoming legislation is likely to require accessible mobile interaction - and this goes far beyond the over-simplified phones currently targeted at older users.

The key scientific contributions will be a detailed investigation into text entry for older adults. By working closely with groups of older users we will develop and test prototype keyboards. This will result in scientific results on understanding the nature of older user text entry and comparing performance with existing solutions. The work will also result in detailed design guidelines through which we aim to make development of mobile solutions for older users easier for others.

As well as scientific results we will release developed keyboards onto the open markets and open source community, build on our current industrial connections and release guidance for developing general mobile apps for older people.

We will host a workshop at MobileHCI to present and discuss our results and push forward the community's work on understanding interaction, and designing mobile solutions, with older adults. To develop her academic skills the post-doc will be jointly responsible for running this workshop.

We will work closely with a Keypoint Technologies (UK head-quartered company with offices in Glasgow, India and USA) to contribute to build on and contribute to their open source text entry initiative, OpenAdaptxt. As part of this collaboration the research-assistant on the project will spend a month in the development offices of Keypoint working with their OpenAdaptxt team. However, all results and developed software will be in the public domain.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286294</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Key Point Technologies</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Project partnership with Key Point Technologies</gtr:description><gtr:id>49EBCABA-2C43-4483-B428-0C6217D61297</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Key Point Technologies worked with the research team and assisted/contributed to the project outcomes</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Some results from the project were embedded in a publicly available keyboard on Google Play. 

Presentation was made to KeyPoint Technologies (project partner and keyboard developer) on the outcomes of the project.

As part of the project we largely organised and ran two international workshops at international conferences (MobileHCI 2014 and MobileHCI 205) on design for older adults and have pushed awareness of this group in the wider HCI community through these meetings. We formed the olderadults.mobi series of workshops which now includes five workshops that some or all of the team were involved in due to this award with a six in May 2017 at CHI 2017 Denver, USA.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A9BE6AB-540C-4E39-AA53-E6EF7EC205EF</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software)</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project investigated mobile smartphone touch screen text entry for older adults. Through participatory design sessions with older adults and controlled usability studies we discovered:

* older adults have a desire for text entry systems that support them in identifying and correcting mistakes made while typing;

* older adults were, in general, more open to new keyboard styles and new text entry approaches than younger adults who are more wedded to QWERTY;

* traditional text entry evaluation measures were unsuitable for studying performance of errors: in the lab people typed slowly and accurately.

As part of the project we developed new text entry study techniques that investigate different aspects of typing from traditional studies and can complement traditional studies: image description tasks, chat tasks and injecting error artificially. These were refined in our studies with publication in press or under review and are all useful in investigating user behaviour under error.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We embedded some of the lessons of the project in an Android keyboard implementation that is available through Google Play. Similar techniques could be used by others on touch-screen keyboards. 

We are also moving forward to investigate potential use of similar approaches in education.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4A6D3FB9-A724-410D-8C1D-8E4DA58BF8FF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Older Adults Text-entry Studies (OATS): Our goal was to capture participants' typing behaviour during input in a lab setting and determine the efficiency of the highlighting keyboard error support mechanism.

Participants were invited to 2 meetings at the University. At the first of these we had sessions of 6-8 participants in a single room, with two researchers acting as &amp;quot;wandering facilitators&amp;quot;. Following on from their session, participants were asked to complete a small amount of &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot;, completing three postcards noting any errors they have made on their phones during a period of a fortnight and how they dealt with this. The goal of these sessions was: Introduce the project, explain what we mean by error correction and some of our findings so far, ask participants how they use corrections and what works (or not) for them, demonstrate current available solutions (iOS, Android, Word classic, Word contemporary, autocorrect and underline), discuss the pros and cons of current solutions, introduce the &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; exercise and explain the next session. At the second session all participants were be brought together with two facilitators. In this session we presented the summary of our findings from all previous workshops, shared the &amp;quot;homework&amp;quot; results with all participants, showed video prototypes of solutions and discussed these, introduced participants to paper prototyping using a simple warm-up task, explore prototypes that participants created themselves and discussed the outcomes.
