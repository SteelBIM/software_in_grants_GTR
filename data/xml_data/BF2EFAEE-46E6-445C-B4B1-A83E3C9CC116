All living and machine entities rely on both information and energy for their existence. Most, if not all, processes in life involve transforming, storing or transferring energy or information in one form or the other. Although these concepts are in harmony in nature, in traditional engineering design, information and energy are handled by two separate systems with limited interaction. In wireless communications, the relationship between information and energy is even more apparent as radio waves that carry information also transfer energy. Indeed, the first use of radio waves was for energy transfer rather than information transmission. However, despite the pioneering work of Tesla, who experimentally demonstrated wireless energy transfer (WET) in the late 19th century, modern wireless communication systems mainly focus on the information content of the radio-frequency (RF) radiation, neglecting the energy transported by the signal. This project is the first interdisciplinary initiative to promote innovation and technology transfer between academia and industry in the UK for one of the most challenging and most important problems in future communication networks: The simultaneous transfer of both energy and information. The aim of this project is to develop a new theoretical framework for the design and operation of next-generation networks with simultaneously wireless information and energy transfer (SWIFT) capabilities. The research efforts are interdisciplinary and bring together researchers with strong and complementary backgrounds in the domain of wireless communications such as electronics/microwave engineering, information theory, game theory, control theory, and communication theory to bridge the gap between theory and practice of future WET-based communication systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>316814</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>In the first work, secrecy transmission with the aid of a group of wireless energy harvesting-enabled amplify-and-forward (AF) relays performing cooperative jamming (CJ) and relaying has been proposed.

The source node in the network does simultaneous wireless information and power transfer with each relay employing a power splitting receiver in the first phase; each relay further divides its harvested power for forwarding the received signal and generating artificial noise for jamming the eavesdroppers in the second transmission phase. In the centralized case with global channel state information (CSI), we provided the closed-form expressions for the optimal and/or suboptimal AF-relay beamforming vectors to maximize the achievable secrecy rate subject to individual power constraints of the relays, using the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR), which is proved to be tight. A fully distributed algorithm utilizing only local CSI at each relay is also proposed as a performance benchmark. This work has been published in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications. 
In the second work, we presented theoretical limits and practical designs of jamming approaches for physical layer security. In particular, the theoretical limits explore the achievable secrecy rates of user cooperation based jamming whilst the centralized, and game theoretic based precoding techniques are reviewed for practical implementations. This work has been published in IEEE ACCESS.
In the third work, we investigated the downlink/uplink of wireless powered networks (WPNs), which are exposed to the effect of the cascaded near-far problem, i.e., the asymmetric overall degradation of the users' performance, due to different path-loss values. More specifically, assuming that the users are able to harvest energy both from interference and desired signals, higher path-loss reduces the downlink rate of the far user, while it also negatively affects its uplink rate, since less energy can be harvested during downlink.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We planned to arrange the workshop to disseminate the research outcome to academics as well as to suitable industries.
