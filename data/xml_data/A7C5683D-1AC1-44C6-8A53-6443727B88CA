This task is made possible by an internal timing mechanism, known as the circadian clock. Circadian clocks help organisms to organize daily events within the cell, so that they occur at appropriate times of the day. Consequently, without a functional clock, cellular processes become disorganized, resulting in reduced fitness, developmental defects, and disease. All known circadian clocks are built from rhythmically expressed clock genes and clock proteins. Although the components of single circadian clocks have been isolated, there is some evidence that a multitude of circadian clocks may exist that act either independently from each other or are organized in a hierarchical 'master-slave' manner. To investigate whether additional cellular clocks exist we propose to utilize Neurospora crassa, a simple fungus and model organism in which the development of asexual spores is controlled by the circadian clock. Neurospora's rhythm in spore production can be easily visualized in a readily available assay. Rhythmic patterns of spore production are also seen in Neurospora mutants from which the components of the known circadian clock are absent. In these clock mutants the rhythms in spore production are most reliably visualized when growing Neurospora in alternating cycles of high and low temperature. We propose to investigate whether these rhythms are due to another circadian clock, or driven by a non-clock mechanism. Thus, using these clock mutants, we aim to identify components of additional clocks or regulators of spore development that are usually controlled by the circadian clock. Our research will reveal factors that control daily rhythms in development and physiology that are vital for survival of all organisms that live and have adapted to a rhythmic world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Daily rhythms in light and temperature conditions pose challenges and provide opportunities for life on Earth. Circadian clocks have evolved to meet these challenges by helping organisms to predict and respond to their rhythmic surroundings. A model organism for the study of clocks is the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. In Neurospora the products of the frequency (frq) and white-collar (wc) genes are central to the circadian FRQ-WHITE-COLLAR oscillator (FWO), imposing rhythmicity onto processes such as asexual spore development. Rhythms in sporulation are also seen in its absence, suggesting that other oscillatory circuits can control development. The underlying principle and molecular basis of these rhythms is unknown, despite their significance for shaping overt rhythmicity of the organism and their contribution to the circadian system. I propose to genetically and molecularly dissect the temperature-controlled processes that control rhythmic development independent of or in conjunction with the known circadian oscillator. I will use genetic screens to identify mutants in temperature-controlled rhythms that exist in quadruple-mutants that lack the frq, wc-1, wc-2, and vvd genes. Secondly, the hypothesis that the clock-associated and temperature-controlled protein VVD acts as a slave oscillator will be tested by studying the basis for temperature-regulation of the vvd gene. Thirdly, we have identified a Neurospora RNA binding protein (NcGRP1) with homology to circadian slave oscillators in plants and mammals. Preliminary data indicate that Ncgrp1 transcript levels are temperature- and circadianly regulated. We will study the impact of NcGRP1 on the Neurospora circadian system by way of effective gene knockout and overexpression strategies. The proposed work should reveal factors that control daily rhythms in development and physiology that are vital for survival of organisms that live in and have adapted to a rhythmic world.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>556965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A composite image of petri dishes showing clock-controlled sporulation in Neurospora.

The utility of VVD as an optogenetic tool has recently been demonstrated in mammalian cell culture and whole animal systems and since optogenetic tools are increasingly used in basic science but also in biotechnology for the generation of production of biopharmaceuticals the knowledge of its interaction with other photoreceptors has direct relevance for developing the VVD/WC-1 interaction and develop the optogenetic toolset further. Thus, a detailed understanding of the regulation and activities of the interactions between these photoreceptors will be essential to advance and better control synthetic circuits in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5952DD1-94F5-4BB4-AC72-88D4F69EBEF2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Light and temperature conditions change rhythmically over the course of the day. The ability to predict these changes is of advantage to organisms as it helps species to maximize their chances for survival by adjusting their physiology and behaviour to best suit the time of day. Indeed, most organisms have evolved endogenous clocks, called circadian clocks, that help organisms to predict the time of day. We are using the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa as a model to study the molecular bases of circadian clocks. We previously discovered that the fungal photosensing molecule VIVID is important for synchronising the Neurospora crassa circadian clock to light-dark cycles. We now discovered that the same molecule interacts with other components of the fungal circadian clock. The discovery of these interactions helps to explain how this molecule enables the circadian clockwork to interpret external light-dark cycles and to properly align its endogenous time to that of the external world. To further understand the molecules and pathways involved in synchronizing circadian clocks we set out to identify all genes that are regulated by light and/or temperature in this fungus. We identified hundreds of genes that are regulated by these cues and have begun to look at mutant strains that lack some of these light and temperature-regulated genes to see if they show defects in the circadian clock. So far, we have identified at least one gene that we propose to be a new central clock gene and many genes that are likely to be involved in orchestrating the response to these cues within the cell. Finally, in collaboration with two other groups and informed by our and the experimental data of other groups we have developed computer models that successfully reproduce the circadian clockwork and its responses to light and temperature changes</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Trying to find and study the molecules involved in light and/or temperature sensing will help us to understand how these factors enable organisms to develop a sense of time and to maintain fully functional in a range of temperatures. Knowledge gained by understanding the nature and function of the sensors involved and the sequence of events that are triggered upon their activation can be exploited in the development of entirely synthetic pathways in which the production of molecules, such as for example biopharmaceuticals can be tightly controlled to optimize
