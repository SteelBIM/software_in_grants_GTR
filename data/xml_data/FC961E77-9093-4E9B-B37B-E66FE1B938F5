Over a hundred and fifty years after slavery ended, residents use its idiom in varied contexts (from domestic to work and more largely economics) yet systematically negate its earlier existence, relocating it in its rival former colonial town. While drawing on existing bodies of work on historical memory and social amnesia, the research combines an historical and ethnographic documentation of the slave trade, the practice of slavery, and their contemporary legacies and representations among the residents of Santa Marta.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Furthermore, the research contributes, in the Latin American and Colombian contexts, to the emerging scholarship on slavery within international human rights, reparation and compensation issues. It also situates itself within ongoing discussions of citizenship, especially attempts at building more inclusive 'multicultural' forms thereof. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, (audio)visual and material displays will be prepared jointly with local historians and curators for a museum exhibition on the slave past of the town, retracing the joint history of slaveholders and of people of African descent.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-11-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Collection of thirty poems awaiting publication based on the research conducted in Santa Marta.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B77111F7-2451-4855-A8FA-27D292DDF29C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A selection has been presented to the members of the public in Colombia itself and has generated much interest on the topic of slavery and other related areas.

I gave a presentation of some of my research findings using a poetic genre, thus offering what I have called 'ethnographic poems' to the attendees. The event took place a week after the first celebration of an Afro-In festival which had been partly hosted at the same venue, and the audience that came to my event was therefore sensitized to the topic. At the end of my presentation I received many comments of positive feedback and thanks for offering a 'true radioscopy' of social and racial life in their city. People said they felt seen and acknowledged, for once. This also gave rise to two interviews, one with a journalist in Santa Marta, and the other based in the nearby town of Barranquilla.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>History and memory of slavery in coastal Colombia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>88C20D55-C4E6-4933-8A3E-C9A49F7337B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This broadcast introduces listeners to the socio-cultural features of the northern Colombian coast, with special reference to Santa Marta, and presents the main features of the socio-historical and racial setup in the area.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Santa Marta Poetica - Interview with Juan Jos?
