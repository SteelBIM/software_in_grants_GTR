2014-2019</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L008351/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Social science forms and transforms our understanding of the world we live in, underpins the development, delivery and evaluation of public policy, as well as commercial and business practice, and informs national and international debate on matters of social, economic and political controversy. Research evidence from the social sciences permeates our lives, from the production, analysis and interpretation of economic indicators, through documenting stability and change in social attitudes, to understanding the factors which lead to educational attainment, community cohesion, national well-being, and inter-state conflict, to select just a few pertinent examples. It is essential, therefore, that social scientific research is as robust as that produced in any other area of scientific endeavour, and that research carried out under the banner of social science is of the highest possible standard in the academic sector and beyond. While the quality of research depends on a number of different factors, the most important is methodology; the ways in which social scientists collect, analyse and interpret social and economic data.

The proposed new National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM) will address long-recognised problems relating to under-capacity in the UK social science research community. It will build on the successful programme of work that has already been undertaken in the Centre's first ten years. However, much has changed since NCRM was founded in 2004, including the emergence of new types and volumes of data to be handled, new modes of communication and networking (such as Facebook, and Twitter), as well as new perspectives on data accessibility and the use of various kinds of administrative data (such as tax records and GP patient records) for research purposes. The sorts of questions that social scientists are seeking to address have also changed, reflecting important shifts in the national and global environment. For instance, social scientists are now addressing questions relating to climate change, food security, online behaviour and identity, international terrorism and the costs of higher education, all of which were either low priority or non-existent issues when NCRM was established a decade ago.

The new Centre will be a partnership between three institutions with leading international reputations in undertaking methodological research and training in the social sciences: the Universities of Southampton, Manchester, and Edinburgh. Together the partner institutions will deliver three core activities: 
1. A programme of methodological research which will develop innovative ways of collecting and analysing new and traditional forms of social science research data. The programme will comprise a set of inter-related work-packages to be undertaken by the collaborating partners and also a set of commissioned projects to complement and integrate with the Centre's research work-packages. 
2. A programme of face-to-face training events in advanced areas of methodological practice, delivered by leading national and international experts at locations which are accessible to social scientists throughout the UK.
3. Develop and expand NCRM's existing heavily used website to incorporate a range of new features and functions, such as tailoring presentation of material to user-specified interests and developing a range of new online resources to enable social scientists to learn about new methods at their own pace and convenience.

The Centre will consult widely with organisations in the public and private sectors to ensure that the work it undertakes is in line with their needs and interests. It will collaborate with leading scholars and institutions from overseas to ensure that the Centre's work meets the highest international standards and to promote its work on the international stage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit? Social science research is undertaken and commissioned by a broad range of non-academic groups and all stand to benefit from the methodological research development and training resources that will be produced and made available through NCRM in its next stage of funding. This includes researchers working in central and local government and the Office for National Statistics, in public sector organisations such as the NHS, and charitable foundations such as the Wellcome Trust and the Nuffield Foundation, as well as smaller third sector organisations. Researchers in commercial and not-for-profit data collection agencies such as NatCen, TNS-BMRB, GfK-NOP and Ipsos-MORI will benefit from the research developments and training opportunities NCRM will provide, as will researchers in the broader commercial and market research industries. 

How will they benefit? Our intention is for the Centre's impact on these non-academic groups to manifest in three primary ways. Firstly, through the Centre's own programme of methodological research (work packages 1 to 6 in case for support). The focus of our research programme has been selected in order to address areas which have previously been identified as being of strategic importance for the broader social science research community by NCRM's own research needs assessments, in the National Data Strategy 2013-2018, and by the 2012 ESRC review of NCRM. Specifically, we expect the work that will be undertaken under the theme of 'complex data with linked and time-dependent structures' to be of use to a broad range of non-academic user groups who are attempting to find suitable ways for managing and analysing increasingly large and complex data structures. For instance, the findings of WP1 and WP2 are likely to be of interest to data collection agencies and survey practitioners seeking to maximise fieldwork efficiency and to mitigate nonresponse bias, while WP3 will benefit data collectors and researchers working at the interface of the medical and social sciences. We also expect the findings from our research into the 'pedgagogy of methodological learning' to be of practical use to organisations such as the ESRC, the Nuffield Foundation and Wellcome Trust, who have an interest in building methodological capacity, particularly (though not entirely) in the area of quantitative and statistical methods. 

Second, the Centre's commissioned programme of methodological research (which will commence in 2015) will be of additional benefit to non-academic users across all sectors. The more flexible nature of the commissioning process in NCRM's next stage will enable this work programme to respond strategically to emerging need and to reflect the concerns of these non-academic user groups. We will involve key non-academic stakeholders and gate-keepers representing the different sectors in our consultations, assessments and reviews to ensure that the commissioned projects produce outcomes which are of clear benefit to them. Non-academic users will also occupy strategically important roles on the Centre's new Advisory Committees. 

Third, the substantial programme of face-to-face short courses and seminars that the Centre will run on an annual basis will enable non-academic researchers to attend high quality training at affordable rates and in accessible locations throughout the UK. NCRM's existing assessments of training needs show that non-academic researchers have particular difficulty in securing time to attend face-to-face training events. We therefore anticipate the Centre's expanded online training resources to be of particular benefit to these groups.

Finally, our research and training programmes will have a positive impact on the general public, albeit indirectly and in the longer term, through the delivery of higher quality research evidence to inform public policy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4917762</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Event: Opinion Polling in the EU Referendum: Challenges and Lessons</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B660B7EB-DFDE-44E4-A761-8B74F64AB429</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research Event on 8th December 2016: Opinion Polling in the EU Referendum: Challenges and Lessons
Organised jointly by NCRM, British Polling Council and Market Research Society and held at the Royal Statistical Society, London.

The referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union presented the opinion polls with a formidable challenge. Support for Remain and Leave crossed party lines. Rather than a debate between left and right, opinions reflected a division between social liberals and social conservatives. Even if the polls had overcome the difficulties that had beset them in 2015 - and that appeared to be still a work in progress - there was no guarantee that methods that had been honed to estimate party support in a general election would work effectively in this seemingly very different environment.

As a result, the campaign was marked by a lively debate about polling methodology, and significant methodological experimentation and adaptation by polling companies. In the event the final polls correctly indicated that the result would be close, but for the most part, incorrectly indicated that Remain would be the most likely winner.

With speakers from the polling companies and members of the BPC/MRS inquiry into the performance of the polls in the 2015 election, this seminar features presentations of how the polling companies set about their task and independent evaluations of the methodology that they used. Its aim is to identify the key lessons to be learned from the referendum for the future of opinion polling.

Digital data is now generated in huge volumes by many citizens and is documenting peoples lives in detail. Moreover citizens are increasingly generating data as part of a sense of their own need to respond and report including during humanitarian crises. These approaches link to debates about civic engagement and the observant digital citizen. Digital citizens are becoming the eyes and ears of the world and the citizen response is becoming part of the tools to tackle social problems and political challenges previously left to the state. There are new opportunities to address intractable social issues but also increasing numbers of voices and truth claims.

In this interactive one-day conference we will explore the future of citizen science and citizen social science methods. We will examine the different types of applications, methods, the data and the challenges posed including in terms of the debates about expertise, divisions of labour, different ways of seeing, data quality, questions about what might still be going undocumented and the ethical issues raised. We will also consider the ways in which more people can be encouraged to participate as citizen scientists.

The conference will include talks by leading academics and practitioners involved in using citizen science and citizen social science methods. There will be opportunities to try out citizen science tools and to contribute to the debates.

The session explores methodological issues around the measurement and analysis of social exposures, biological processes and their interactions in longitudinal survey datasets. Topics covered include: the biological significance of 'standard' biomarkers that are available in many survey datasets, how they are measured and incorporated in analysis, and how such biomarkers are theoretically and conceptually linked to social processes measured in surveys. 

. Sept 1st AM Session 2: Developing social-biological models (Noriko Cable, Jessica Abell, Meena Kumari, Scott Montgomery, Mel Bartley and David Blane: ICLS, UCL https://www.ucl.ac.uk/icls)

The focus of this session was on supporting the autumn school participants to develop their own models regarding social-biological interactions and processes. The participants worked in groups, supported by input from researchers from ICLS, presented their social-biological models to the class, and received feedback.

. Sept 1st PM Session 3: Using 'Omics Data in the social sciences (Adam Stevens, Kris Mekli, Neil Pendleton and Nicholas Rattray, fRAILL Manchesterhttp://www.micra.manchester.ac.uk/research/fraill/) 

This session focused on the &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; biomarker data that are increasingly available in longitudinal surveys, with presentations from members of the &amp;quot;Frailty, Resilience And Inequality in Later Life research team&amp;quot; (fRAILL) at Manchester. These was introductory sessions on Genomics (Adam Stevens and Kris Mekli), Epigenetics (Neil Pendleton), and Metabolomics (Nik Rattray) with particular consideration of how such data can be incorporated in social science analyses. These introductory talks were followed by an open discussion on the challenges of analysing 'omics data in the social sciences.

These data come in many different forms and granularities from the traditional longitudinal data provided by the UK's world envied cohort studies through user data generated social media data to tracking data generated by mobiles and live streams from sensors.

This workshop will bring together social and data scientists who work with these data with the aim exchanging ideas and develop the agenda for the social and behavioural sciences. In plenary we will see presentations on cutting edge methods and new research questions made possible by these data and in break out groups we will draw out the key themes and future methodological research agenda.

The intended output of the workshop is a position paper for submission to a top journal. All workshop attendees will be invited to co-author that paper, which is why we are inviting applications to attend this event. Applications are made via the registration link below.

The workshop will run from 13:00 on 19th January to 14:00 on the 20th January. There will be a workshop dinner on the evening of the 19th.

This informed the ESRC's research strategy in research methods for the period 2016-2019. We also undertook an assessment of methodological training need which has informed the Centre's training strategy and fed into ESRC's Doctoral Training strategy. 

In addition to strategic reviews and assessments, the NCRM research programme comprises 7 inter-related Work Packages. The majority have been running for a little over one year, so are still at a relatively early stage. Nonetheless, a number of findings have already been produced.

We have undertaken methodological research in the area of survey methodology which has developed a new method for studying the effects of interviewers on data quality. As part of this research we have developed new metrics for interviewer performance assessment and are in discussions with a leading data collection agency about how they might implement the new methods to monitor and improve interviewer performance. Research has also been undertaken into cost-effectiveness and accuracy of different data collection for surveys. Surveys are immensely important for government, academic, commercial and voluntary sector organisations and this research will help to improve the way this type of research is done and to also reduce the substantial cost of data collection. The research has been studying interviewer calling patterns and developing new ways of monitoring performance on large scale interviewer surveys. We have been working with a private sector partner to ensure that the work has relevance to actual practice. 

The UK has been at the cutting edge of recent developments in qualitative longitudinal research (QLR). The goal of QLR is to enable the exploration of complex processes, context and trajectories of social change and continuity. NCRM research is extending and developing secondary analytic practice in working with complex longitudinal data drawing on material from the ESRC Timescapes study. In our work so far, we have developed of analytic strategy using an archaeological metaphor to capture the layered 'scaling down' process of working across multiple sets of qualitative longitudinal data and their waves of data collection. This has involved 1. 'Surface survey' (mapping the scope and nature of the data) 2. A geophysical survey (corpus analysis) 3. Shovel test pits (case analysis across and within the data sets). We are now moving onto a 4th stage - Deep excavations. Using the outcomes of our 'surveys' and 'test pits', this has involved a narrowing of our substantive focus to 'arguments' and the development of an associated keyword list. To facilitate our 'geophysical surveys' (see above) we have utilised a range of computerised forms of analysis, including Nvivo, Leximancer and 'R'. To support our work we have completed training in using the CAQDAS package Leximancer, uploading of data set and initial analyses. 

Data Stewardship Organisations (DSOs) are charged with producing useful data products whilst minimising the risk of disclosure of personal information. Work in this area has traditionally focused on the disclosure risk associated with census and survey data products in the context of other information that an 'intruder' might use to identify persons and households. NCRM research addresses how such disclosure risks must be reconsidered in the rapidly changing linked data environment, in which extensive geographically and temporally referenced data about persons, addresses and households can be combined in analytically powerful ways. Work to date has shown, inter alia, that the classical Fellegi-Sunter linkage approach could be extended to cases where there are no key variables. Linkage was performed using Bayes factors generated from a full probability model fitted from labelled training data. However, the method was only shown to be effective (but much more effective than existing approaches) for 1 to 1 matching scenarios with low numbers of record pairs. 

A further strand of NCRM research addresses the problem that provision of courses in advanced social science research methods is unlikely to ensure that capacity is developed in areas of strategic need without attention to the quality of the pedagogy associated with such courses. Hence our aim is to provide an evidence base in which the call for 'more training' can be translated into knowing the kinds of training that are suited to the particular challenge of advanced methodological learning. We have carried out research on the pedagogy of methodological learning, involving learners and teachers of research methods to understand ways of learning and whether and how these are effective. We find that teachers of methods are developing pedagogic content knowledge that is specific to advanced method teaching. This is characterised by active learning that engages learners in the methods at hand, Learning by Doing to give learners experience of research practice, and reflexivity to help learners understand the different ways in which research problems can be engaged with. Methods teachers teach both with and through data, and respond to the challenges of diverse learners and dynamic and difficult content.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have already been used to inform policy for the ESRC.
