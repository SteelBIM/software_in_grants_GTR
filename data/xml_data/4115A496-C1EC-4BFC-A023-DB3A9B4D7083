mouse embryo</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/G011117/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In the last few years the genetic code or 'blueprint' for man has become available. Although this information is nearly complete, we still do not know how to translate the code, how to use it to rebuild the cells of damaged tissues or how to understand the remarkable development of an individual from a single fertilised egg. What we do know now is that this code is interpreted in each cell in the body by a group of agents that are collectively called 'chromatin-modifiers'. Our laboratory looks at the chromatin structure of embryonic stem (ES) cells. These remarkable cells are pluripotent, meaning they have the potential to differentiate into any cell type found in the body. Twenty-five years ago the first ES cell lines were derived from early mouse embryos into culture. The regulatory mechanisms, which define ES cell 'pluripotency' or differentiation, were not understood, although potential application for regenerative medicine was immediately foreseen. Deciphering how pluripotency is achieved and how it can be harnessed and maintained in culture are key questions for understanding normal development and successfully applying the knowledge to stem cell-based therapies. We intend to unravel the unique chromatin 'make-up' of pluripotent ES cells and their counterparts in the embryo that confers them flexibility and unlimited cell fate options. We also explore how this can be dynamically changed in a manner that is predictable when a stem cell decides to become a specific cell type (e.g. nerve, muscle or blood cell). This information will help us to understand how the genetic code is used, and help us to design better strategies for turning stem cells into cells that are useful for treating degenerative diseases and other human diseases.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Pluripotent cells develop within the inner cell mass (ICM) of early-stage blastocyst embryos, a cell population surrounded by an extraembryonic layer, the trophectoderm (TE). Here, we use both embryo-derived stem cells and in vivo studies to investigate the epigenetic mechanisms leading to blastocyst lineage segregation and pluripotency safeguarding. Recent studies in ES cells showed that many silent genes that are required later on during development are simultaneously marked with Polycomb repressor (PRC)-mediated H3K27 methylation, and marks normally associated with gene activity. Moreover, these so-called bivalent genes assemble RNA Polymerase (RNAP) complexes and are transcribed at low level, specifying a 'primed' state in pluripotent cells. We have begun to compare the chromatin profiles of ES and TE-derived trophoblast stem (TS) cells. Though many genes are bivalently marked in TS cells as in ES cells, they are not normally expressed in this lineage. To explore this further, we will examine the chromatin environment of ES and TS cells at bivalent promoters by assessing PRC1 and PRC2 binding, RNAP occupancy and conformation and, additional 'lock in' mechanisms in TS cells that may operate to avoid reprogramming. We also address the role of key stem cell transcription factors in targeting chromatin changes using ES cell de-differentiation models upon Oct4 loss or gain of Cdx2. In order to confirm the biological significance of 'primed' chromatin in the embryo we will use carrier ChIP assay to investigate the epigenetic relationship between ES and TS cells and in vivo ICM and TE cells. In particular, we intend to explore how and when specific differences in epigenetic programming are specified, at the locus level, between embryonic and extraembryonic tissues. This will lead to in vivo lineage tracing studies where single blastomere knock-down (RNA interference), jointly labelled with a dye, can reveal the effects of epigenetic program failure on cell allocation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>382110</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Chiba University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:description>Protein-protein interactions - mapping of domains</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E6FCB0C-4D92-488E-A518-161FCF8D7942</gtr:id><gtr:impact>* Publication (PMID: 22713603) and scientific communications (conferences, guest lectures).

? These findings discovered an early developmental role for the Polycomb group member Bmi1 as a key posttranslational co-regulator of Gata factors,and proposed a novel regulatory pathway by which Bmi1 action on Gata6 protein stability/activity directly impacts on cell fate allocations between extra-embryonic and pluripotent identities.
* Generation of truncated Gata6 mutants lacking the C-terminal domain alone (dCT) or including its Zinc finger region (dCTZF), where putative lysine ubiquitination sites are preferentially mapped. This allowed us to identify Gata6 C-terminal domain as being critical for Gata6
ubiquitination/degradation as well as for its interaction with Bmi1 in a ring domain dependent manner, providing further insights into how Bmi1 might stabilise Gata6 protein expression in primitive endoderm derivatives.

This allowed us to provide the first in vivo evidence that bivalent histone marking (i.e. H3K27me3/H3K4me2) operates in the early mouse embryos at silent, key developmental genes (PMID: 20573702). We furthermore demonstrated that a set of somatic lineage regulators that carry bivalent signatures is selectively targeted by Suv39h1-mediated H3K9 methylation (and de novo DNA methylation) upon TE lineage formation. In contrast, H3K9me3 marks were not detected in ICM as well as in morula cells at these loci, further suggesting that the acquisition of additional repressive marks at bivalent, lineage-inappropriate genes might be a late event linked with trophoblast cell fate consolidation and loss of lineage plasticity.

These findings discovered an early developmental role for the Polycomb group member Bmi1 as a key posttranslational co-regulator of Gata factors, and proposed a novel regulatory pathway by which Bmi1 action on Gata6 protein stability/activity directly impacts on cell fate allocations between extra-embryonic and pluripotent identities.

Application and exploitation

Our research lies at the heart of BBSRC's mission to support basic research underpinning human health. This project advanced fundamental understanding of how pluripotency is achieved and maintained, and how cell potency and specification are balanced in stem cells and in the early embryo. 

Capacity and involvement

All members of our research team participate in the various impact and communication activities. Staff/PhD students who contributed to the success of this award received multi-disciplinary training and benefited from a world-leading research environment at Imperial College and through collaborations at other Research Institutes of Excellence. They were active participants in weekly lab and divisional meetings. Attendance to national and international meetings as well as workshops (e.g. Epigenetics, Marie Curie Institute) exposed them to the latest developments in the field and provided career development opportunities by allowing them to present results to their peers and to the leaders in the field. Staff/PhD students also participated in teaching at our divisional MSc programme in Reproductive and Developmental Biology including practical training course as well as co-supervising MSc students within our group. Additional transferrable skill training was ensured within Imperial College London. Altogether, this means that staff has been trained to a very high level, enhancing UK's economic competitiveness and making him a highly employable and sought-after expert.

In the context of the early mammalian embryo this implies promoting the formation of two essential extra-embryonic tissues for embryo survival (e.g. the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm), while critically maintaining a pool of pluripotent cells with abilities to generate all somatic cell types found in the body. The isolation and propagation in culture of pluripotent cells from the early embryo was a pivotal achievement in the field of developmental and stem cell biology. These remarkable embryonic stem (ES) cells can indeed self-renew for unlimited periods of time whilst retaining their full developmental potency, hence offering a valuable model system to decipher how pluripotency is achieved/balanced and subsequently lost as the embryo develops.

 In the past few decades, it has become clear that chromatin and epigenetic factors can play a key role in a large array of biological processes, including development. The modification of chromatin and its histone components adds an additional layer of regulation that ultimately extends the information content of the underlying genome sequence. This project investigated the specific chromatin 'make-up' of pluripotent ES cells and their in vivo counterparts, and furthermore identified novel epigenetic pathways that underlie cell specialisation while preserving pluripotency during early embryonic development. 

Most significant achievements of this grant 1- Alder, Lavial, et al. Ring1B and Suv39h1 delineate distinct chromatin states at bivalent genes during early mouse lineage commitment. Development 2010. These findings provided the first in vivo evidence that Polycomb-mediated repression and bivalent histone marking operate at silent, key developmental genes in the mouse early embryo and furthermore proposed a novel epigenetic pathway by which extra-embryonic lineage commitment can be reinforced and pluripotency safeguarded upon blastocyst formation. 2- Lavial et al. Bmi1 facilitates primitive endoderm formation by stabilizing Gata6 during early mouse development. Genes &amp;amp; Development 2012. These findings uncovered a novel and early developmental role for the Polycomb member Bmi1 as a key post-transcriptional regulator of Gata factors. Notably, this study revealed how Bmi1 action on Gata6 stability can alter the balance between Nanog and Gata6 protein levels in individual blastomeres to introduce a bias towards a primitive endoderm identity, and more generally how mechanisms regulating protein stability/activity can directly impact on cell fate decisions. 3- Rute Tomaz et al. Jmjd2c facilitates the assembly of essential enhancer-protein complexes at the onset of embryonic stem cell differentiation. Development 2017. Further funding were successfully secured based on the above outcomes (point 1) and preliminary data generated by F. Lavial (Research Associate funded on this grant). This allowed us to identify a novel role for the epigenetic regulator Jmjd2c/Kdm4c in embryonic versus extra-embryonic stem cells independent of its canonical histone demethylase activity. Notably, we uncovered that Jmjd2c is strictly required for somatic multi-lineage differentiation by promoting the assembly of multi-protein complexes at poised enhancers in embryonic stem cells.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Understanding how differentiation occurs in nature is vital to recapitulating it in the clinic, for the benefit of patients. This work, though very basic in its focus, has great potential to be exploited for therapeutic and economic good. The research will shed light on how the correct balance is struck between generating/maintaining stem cells and directing their differentiation. This understanding will naturally flow into the clinic, in the form of better protocols for directing the differentiation of pluripotent and other stem cells. It will also inform regenerative medicine approaches that aim to reactivate endogenous stem cell pools in the body, by providing insights into which molecular pathways should be targeted. Increased understanding of how the formation of two essential extra-embryonic tissues (e.g. the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm) is promoted while safeguarding pluripotency in pre-implantation embryos will also greatly help identification of likely candidate factors that determine embryo implantation and its subsequent development and therefore impact on reproduction.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>24AAD3DB-4821-44CE-BA15-8C59849189AF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Generation of Ncoa3 ChiP-sequencing datasets in embryonic stem cells ad well as microarray datasets upon shRNA-mediated Ncoa3 depletion.</gtr:description><gtr:id>90702AFB-2685-46E3-877D-47509C89DEF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>* Publications (PMID: 23019124; PMID: 23287469) and scientific communications (conferences, guest lectures).
