As the brittle, near-surface crust tries to accommodate the deformation, earthquakes occur on faults inside the earth. The need to understand how the continents deform, and where earthquakes will occur, is compelling - between 1.4 and 1.7 million people have died in earthquakes in the continental interiors since 1900.

We can measure the way the continents are actively deforming using satellites. GPS can provide very precise measurements of how individual points on the ground move, but such points are often sparsely distributed. Over the past two decades, satellites designed by the European Space Agency (ESA) have demonstrated the ability of satellite-borne radar to measure displacements of the earth's surface. The radar repeatedly sends out bursts of a microwave signal that scatters back from the surface and is measured when it returns to the spacecraft. We use differences in the radar returns acquired by the satellite at two different times to measure the displacement of that point over the intervening time interval. Displacements of a few millimeters or less can be measured in this way.

As the continental crust deforms, the rocks continue to bend, building up strain that will be released in future earthquakes. When assessing earthquake hazard, in addition to knowing where the faults are on which the earthquakes will occur, it is essential to know the rate at which this strain is growing. These rates are small, however, and not easy to measure using radar in the presence of noise caused by changes on the ground from which the radar scatters and in the properties of the atmosphere through which the radar signal passes. In addition, errors in our knowledge of the position of the satellites affect our measurements. Methods can be devised to counter these difficulties, but the opportunities to apply them has been limited with the current satellites by the irregular and infrequent acquisition of radar images over many parts of the seismic belts.

We are motivated to bring the efforts of a team of investigators to bear on these questions because of the planned launch by ESA in mid-to-late 2013 of Sentinel-1A, a new radar satellite. An identical partner, Sentinel-1B will be launched 18 months later. Each spacecraft will pass over a given point on the earth's surface every 6 days; once both are in orbit any point will be revisited every 3 days. This short time interval, plus the fact that observations will be made for every pass of the spacecraft and its position will be carefully controlled and well known, will mean a radical improvement in our ability to measure rates of motion and strain. By combining the measurements from all available satellite tracks, together with any GPS data available, we will be able to map in detail over large areas the rates at which strain is building up. 

We plan to look at what happens inside the continents as they deform by using such observations to test and constrain physical models. Thus the displacements occurring in an earthquake measured by radar can be used to infer the movements that have taken place on the fault at depth. The way the earth's surface in the vicinity of an earthquake continues to move immediately after it tells us about the mechanical properties of the surrounding region, knowledge essential to understanding how the forces around a fault vary with time. On a larger scale, the spatial distribution of strain in the continents tells us about changes in the strength of the crust. With these constraints we can test competing hypotheses about how the continents deform and what are the major factors controlling where the deformation occurs.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have identified and engaged with a wide range of non-academic end users of our research, which will have wide-reaching economic and societal impact in several key areas:

1. Geospatial Service Providers.
The state-of-the-art, high-resolution deformation products that we will produce in this project have considerable commercial and societal value. We will use Sentinel-1 to provide near-real-time (rather than post-processed) deformation maps and time. Through the International Space Innovation Centre at Harwell (ISIC) we will actively engage with SMEs to develop and market targeted new geospatial services derived from our results, aimed at the end users in the public and private sector. Potential services could include real-time monitoring of landslides, volcanoes, and man-made subsidence. These impacts will be facilitated through existing links with ISIC and the National Centre for Earth Observation; NCEO aim to commit a member of their impact team to capitalise on the opportunities arising from this project.

2. Meteorological Agencies.
As a by-product, we will produce high-resolution maps of tropospheric path delay in near real time, which have the potential to be assimilated into numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The data will improve knowledge of the spatial distribution of atmospheric water vapour, and the ability to forecast localised heavy rainfall events. We have engaged with the satellite applications group at the Met Office, which currently assimilates path delay measurements from GPS sites. Although the InSAR path delay maps are snapshots in time, they are effectively continuous in space, and so complement the data currently available from GPS.

3. Government Institutions responsible for earthquake hazard assessment.
One of the most significant outputs of our research will be improved earthquake hazard assessment for the Alpine-Himalayan Belt through the new strain-rate and fault maps of the region. This will have high societal value to government institutions responsible for earthquake hazard assessment. Several of the investigators on this project are also investigators on Earthquakes without Frontiers (EwF), a NERC/ESRC directed program aimed at Increasing Resilience to Natural Hazards. Through this project we are already heavily engaged with a wide partnership of end users from across the entire Alpine-Himalayan Belt, including local, regional, and national governments and NGOs working on disaster risk reduction. We expect these organisations to use our new hazard map and will encourage this through the EwF partnership.

4. The Global Earthquake Model (GEM) and insurance industry.
GEM is a &amp;quot;global collaborative effort with the aim to provide organisations and people with tools and resources for transparent assessment of earthquake risk anywhere in the world&amp;quot; (www.globalquakemodel.org), funded through a partnership of public and private organisations, including the global insurance and re-insurance industry. Our high-resolution strain data from InSAR will inform the next generation of strain models within GEM. Furthermore, our fault-mapping work will feed directly into the efforts of GEM to identify active faults.

5. Public understanding of science.
Earthquakes and tectonics provide a compelling subject with which to engage the public in science. The investigators have a very strong track record in public outreach, regularly providing solicited and unsolicited interviews and articles for the national and international media.

6. Capacity building in developing countries.
The investigators have a strong track record of working with scientists from developing countries to help build capacity. This is particularly critical for work on seismic hazard as it is local scientists who have most influence on their governments and decision makers in times of seismic crisis and will be facilitated in this project through a funded International Opportunities Fund project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>817640</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nevada</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>InSAR GSRM</gtr:description><gtr:id>81B22B31-465C-44A5-AACA-32C92132C401</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs will be forthcoming, as this work is still in progress.

This marked the first time a significant ground deformation event was imaged with Sentinel-1's new InSAR technique-terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS)-in which the radar beam is carefully steered to improve image quality.

The TOPS InSAR images revealed changes in the volcano's surface topography, allowing the researchers to model magma flow underneath.

The conference will have a practical legacy, as well as advancing scientific understanding. Policy briefings are being produced on the main themes and conclusions of the conference, and government representatives have expressed their wish to continue a dialogue about these issues with those involved in the conference. The conference will also lead to publication of scientific papers. 

Booklets in English covering the course content of the related schools programme were provided to participating schools and students.

1. LiCSAR service launched December 2017.
2. Work on the Italy and New Zealand earthquakes using Sentinel-1 data.

2015 academic year entry:
1. Work on the Napa earthquake, including a publication in EOS. This is the first earthquake to use data from Sentinel-1 and demonstrated the potential of this system
2. Several publications by PhD student David Bekaert on the atmospheric contribution to InSAR data. One result of this was the production of a software toolbox (TRAIN) that has already been downloaded more than 300 times by scientists across the world.
3. The development of an automatic InSAR processing system using Sentinel-1 data is now well underway, with a plan to launch a pilot system in 2016.


2014 academic year entry:
Key findings:
1. Paper on normal faulting in Tibet. Demonstrates that mapping the faults that you can see is not enough - there is hazard away from the mapped faults.
2. Paper on velocity field in eastern Turkey. As well as demonstrating the method of mapping crustal strain from space, we show that you cannot consider eastern Turkey to be a set of crustal blocks - there has to be some internal strain as well.
3. Paper on crustal shear zones.

Different correction methods are applied today based on auxiliary data, including GNSS, weather models (e.g. ECMWF ERA-I, WRF, NARR, etc), spectrometer data (MERIS and MODIS), or combinations of different sources. Alternative methods exist to estimate the tropospheric delays from the radar data themselves. The success rate of the different techniques is dependant on multiple factors like temporal and spatial resolution, cloud cover, signal contamination, local topography, etc.

TRAIN provides a set of MATLAB tools that can be used to correct for tropospheric delays in InSAR data. Once set-up for one correction method, the toolbox allows for easy comparison with other methods, as all are formatted in the same way. The toolbox is fully compatible, but not limited, to the Doris and StaMPS software. Initial debugging has been done for ROI_PAC and PI-rate processed data, but user feedback and reporting will allow for further development. The toolbox includes the correction methods provided below, with a full descriptive manual on the input parameters, and tips/hints in case of problems.
