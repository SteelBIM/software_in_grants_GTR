However, such work has rarely taken account of the impact of religious faith on sexuality, and vice versa. Thus, current research lacks a serious attempt to document and reflect upon the sexual lives, identities, decisions, and expressions of religious/spiritual young adults. On the other hand, social research on religion generally fails to engage with the increasing prominence of sex, sexuality and eroticism in contemporary Britain. The proposed research project aims to fill this gap in academic and cultural knowledge. The project has four primary aims: \n\n1) To explore the constructions, presentations, and management strategies undertaken by religious/spiritual young adults (aged 18-25) from diverse faith backgrounds (namely Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Sikh, Jewish, and Buddhist) concerning their sexual identities, values, and choices; \n2) To examine the significant social, cultural, and political factors that inform the above-mentioned processes; \n3) To study how these religious/spiritual young adults manage their religious, sexual, and gender identities; \n4) To generate rich qualitative and quantitative data that will contribute new knowledge to academic and policy debates on religion, youth, sexuality, and gender. \n\nTherefore, the project will add to social and policy understanding of the inter-connection of faith and sexuality in religious/spiritual young adults' lives. It will also uncover the everyday negotiations which highlight the ongoing and simultaneous influence of religious faith and sexuality in the day-to-day. In essence, this highly significant and original study will explore how sex and religion inform respondents' lives, within an increasingly sexualised and secular British society. By doing so, the study will explore the continuing importance of faith in contemporary British society, and offers a new perspective on how faith is constructed, managed and presented in what is often seen to be an increasingly faithless society. \n\nIn order to capture respondents' experiences and life circumstances accurately, the two-year project will adopt a mixed-method approach, in three stages. The first stage involves the completion of a questionnaire - distributed in person, via post, e-mail, and the project website - by 600 respondents (100 from each of the above-mentioned faith communities). This questionnaire will provide an overview of each respondent's personal circumstances and experiences in line with the project aims. The second stage will involve semi-structured interviews with 60 respondents (10 from each faith community). The interviews will further explore issues raised in the questionnaire, and will allow respondents freedom to express and reflect upon their religious and sexual lives. The final stage of the research aims to more directly access day-to-day and ongoing experiences. 24 respondents (4 from each faith community) will be asked to keep a video diary respectively - for one week - in which they record their reflections on 'mundane' and 'significant' issues relating to their religious faith and sexuality, following some guidelines. This innovative method will allow the research to access everyday experiences which highlight the ongoing interaction between religion, sexuality, youth and gender. \n\nThe project will place great importance on user-group engagement. This is reflected in the collaboration with relevant religious and youth groups to recruit respondents, and in the advisory committee comprising, among others, six user-group stakeholders. User-group engagement will also feature strongly in the non-academic aspect of the dissemination plan, including an interactive website, articles, summary of research findings, and conferences/seminars. Academic outputs include a book, articles, and conference/seminar presentations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240424</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young religious adults: Some key issues</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AFAA4E0B-E4CD-4199-B3A0-FD44C59A8107</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture to second-year students on the module 'Belief, Spirituality and Religion', University of Nottingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A multi-faith exploration of young religious believers' sexualities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA73BAD2-69CD-4D31-BBB2-5B3EE26B406A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture at the Department of Theology and Religious Studies, King's College, University of London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young Christians negotiating their religious and sexual identities</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97FC8F78-9D64-4395-BB36-45CAD4594568</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BSA Sociology of Religion Study Group Annual Conference: The Changing Face of Christianity, University of Edinburgh</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researching religion, sexuality and gender: Some reflections</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F8030C8D-3952-4649-87ED-6033CDDF9B4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Gender and Religion in Present-Day Society' International Conference, Stockholm University</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transgression and transformation: Some sociological reflections on lesbian and gay activism within monotheistic traditions</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>39964FE6-9F3A-406A-A4D5-75185A7F3C49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Yip, A.

As one can see from the 50 engagement activities thus far, many of such finding-disseminating efforts focused on the above-mentioned non-academic user communities.

The participants held different meanings regarding their
religious faith. These meanings were not mutually exclusive.
Many considered being religious as having a belief in, and a
relationship with, a personal God or a divine power. To them,
this belief and relationship gave strength and meaning to
life. In addition, some participants considered religious faith
as a form of personalised spirituality and philosophy for life
that promoted self-improvement and enlightenment.

2. The participants acknowledged the significant social
dimension of religious faith which not only illuminated their
personal lives, but also helped foster interpersonal and
community connections. Some participants also emphasised
the sense of ethnic and cultural belonging that their
religious identification offered. However, some participants
separated personal spirituality from institutional religiosity,
considering institutional religion a social control mechanism
that excessively regulated gender and sexual behaviour.

3. Almost half (48.2%)1 of the participants considered
themselves 'liberal'/'very liberal', and a quarter of them
(25.1%) considered themselves 'conservative'/'very
conservative'. In terms of religious participation, the
majority of the participants (65.1%) were involved in
a religious community in one way or another and just
over half of the participants (56.7%) attended a public
religious gathering at least once a week.

4. While the majority of participants used a particular
label to identify their sexual orientation, some deliberately
questioned the usefulness and accuracy of such labelling.
On the whole, the participants were less reflective and
articulate about their sexualities compared to their
religious faiths, particularly heterosexual participants.

5. Fewer than half of the participants (43.1%) were
sexually active. Further, 12.9% of the participants engaged
in casual sex. Just over a quarter of participants who were
single (28.7%) were sexually active. Further, 36% of
participants in partnered but unmarried heterosexual
relationships were not sexually active, perhaps reflecting
their commitment to the religious ideal of 'sex within
marriage only'.

6. Most participants thought that the expression of one's
sexuality was desirable, and 29.9% thought that celibacy
was fulfilling. While many participants thought that
consenting adults should be allowed to express their
sexualities, opinions varied on the ways in which they should
do so, with some participants believing that consenting
adults should be able to express their sexualities however
they wished, while others believed sexual expression should
be limited to marriage or a committed relationship.

7. The participants were almost equally split on the idea
that sex should only occur within marriage, suggesting
that some religious young adults had moved from 'sex in
marriage' as the ideal to 'meaningful or committed sexual
expression' as the ideal (but in diverse relational contexts).
In addition, monogamy within a partnered relationship
was highly valued.

8. About one-third of the participants (31.6%) believed
that heterosexuality should be the only expression of
human sexuality, and a bigger proportion (52.4%) thought
that it should be the ideal for human sexuality. 58.1% of
the participants were committed to treating heterosexuality
and homosexuality on equal terms.

9. Just over half of the participants (54.8%) thought
that their religions were positive towards sexuality issues.
However, there was also a significant proportion who
viewed fairly negatively the knowledge base of priests or
religious leaders in relation to sexuality, particularly matters
pertaining to youth sexuality. For lesbian, gay and bisexual
participants, while some had successfully reconciled their
sexuality to their religious faith, some reported the
psychological and social costs of 'coming out' and
managing their sexual and religious identities.

10. Religious faith was by far the most important source of
information for the participants' sexual values/attitudes and
sexual practices. Religious texts, parents/caregivers, friends,
the internet and the media also played a role in this respect,
but less significantly. Only around 1% of the participants
considered religious leaders the most important source
of influence.

11. Further, in terms of sexual practices in comparison
to sexual values/attitudes, the significance of the role
of friends and the internet/the media increased, and the
role of religious faith, religious texts and parent/caregivers
decreased. This is likely due to the fact that friends and the
internet/media were perceived to be the safer and more
supportive sources to address the specific issues of how
to practise one's sexuality.

12. The participants' experiences in connecting their
religious faith and sexuality were diverse. There are
three primary manifestations: (i) tension and conflict
due to difficulty in managing these two dimensions;
(ii) compartmentalisation of these two dimensions in order
to minimise tension and conflict; and (iii) accommodation
and harmonious acceptance of these two dimensions.
19. The participants identified a variety of challenges for
them as young religious adults in secular society. These
included: stigmatisation of religion, sexualised culture,
drinking culture and consumer society. However the
majority (67.4%) did not believe that being religious
made their everyday life more difficult.

13. The majority of participants (68.5%) believed that
religious people were stigmatised in Britain. 35.3% thought
that it was difficult to talk about their religious faith with
non-believers. Further, some felt that references to religion
in society often took the form of jokes or gross
generalisations.

14. The majority of participants (76.1%) believed there was
too much focus on sex in mainstream society. Particularly,
they considered sexualised culture and the prevalence of
sexual promiscuity significant issues for religious young
adults.

15. The majority of participants (63.4%) believed that their
religions upheld gender equality in principle. However, some
expressed concern that this was not the case in reality, with,
for example, perceived gender inequality being evidenced
at places of worship.

16. A high number of participants (73.2%) agreed with
women being involved in religious leadership. This was
particularly important for young women who saw women
in leadership as role models.

17. Religious faith was considered the main factor
influencing how the participants lived their lives as women
or men. Some participants acknowledged that there were
discrepant expectations for women and men particularly
in the context of relationships and raising children.
However, 65.6% of women and 68.1% of men disagreed
that women should have primary responsibility for raising
children. To them, it should be a shared responsibility.

18. Religious young adults can benefit from hearing the
stories of their contemporaries to understand the wide
range of experiences and negotiations in their religious
and sexual lives. This knowledge could offer help in
integrating religious faith and sexuality more successfully.
Engagement with mainstream society may also encourage
understanding and respect between non-religious and
religious young adults.

19. Young religious adults desire an increased openness
to discussions of faith and sexuality within their religions.
Religious leaders and professionals should be open to such
discussions, willing to reflect on young adults' interactions
with secular culture and to engage with secular youth
workers and health professionals to find ways of
providing support for religious young adults.

20.Training of practitioners working with young adults
in secular contexts needs to recognise the role and
importance of religious faith in some young adults' lives.
More collaboration is also needed between religious leaders
and professionals who work with young adults in secular
contexts, in order to formulate policy and practice that
provides consistent advice and guidance.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since the completion of the project in February 2011, the research team have been busy disseminating the findings to diverse audiences through publications, national and international conferences/seminars. To date, we have presented findings in about 45 academic and non-academic conferences/seminars. We have also generated, thus far, 11 academic publications (including one substantial research monograph), and one research report aiming specifically at diverse non-academic communities (e.g. religious leaders, youth workers, sexual health advisors etc.). Owing to the substantial amount of data, we are still in the process of generating outputs, including another substantial research
