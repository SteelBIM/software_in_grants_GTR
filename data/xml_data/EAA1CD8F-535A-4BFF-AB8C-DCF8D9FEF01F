academics and their evidence base, to broadcast Resilient Therapy (RT) and build on the RT&lt;br />practice and knowledge base that Professor Hart and her team have begun to establish. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>With over 1000 academic studies on achieving resilience, few translate this learning into what to do in practice. RT, which has been co-innovated by academics, practitioners and parents of children with complex needs, is a way of working with disadvantaged children and young people that offers a framework for helping them bounce back. RT involves both developing the resilience research base and offering its lessons to practitioners, parents and young people. It is a scholarly, popular and user-friendly method of achieving good outcomes and is designed for all to use including parent carers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Through the use of pilot activities such as individual consultations, training, workshops, drama and mentorship, RT can bring about organisational change.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Building resilience will: spread knowledge, set up activities, ensure RT works in the real world; help community and university partners to swap their expertise and to recognise the value of each others' contributions, create an RT training programme and website. &lt;/p>

The 'Resilience House' exhibition showcased the various RCUK resilience related projects with which the University of Brighton and boingboing have been involved. Within the 'Resilience House' there were various areas that corresponded to the 5 key areas of the resilience framework and within these we displayed videos, posters, resilience guides and other artistic outputs. Young people with complex needs and mental health difficulties co-curated the event and they explained the outputs to the visitors and were also involved in interactive aspects of the house such as making a 'Resilient tablecloth' and making a 'Resilience cake'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>72D59889-0019-4DFD-BCEB-41CE4A37C78D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The festival ran for 2 days and on the second day, the 'Resilience House' was viewed by 135 people (accurate visitor statistics for day one are not available). Visitors to the stand asked questions about the projects that we have been working on and were keen to learn more about how we work with the various community partners. We have received requests to exhibit the 'Resilience House' at other conferences and events in the UK. The young people who co-curated and participated in the event have reported being more confident and they have experienced improvements in their mental health. Boingboing has appointed one of the young people as an artist in residence and they have a Visiting Fellowship at the University of Brighton. Other young people have been co-trainers at numerous events and a group of the young people are undertaking a cooperative research project on resilience.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Resilience House</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWMGU9nKX9U</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'The One Step Forward - Resilience Project Documentary' is a 14 minute film about a Resilience project that was undertaken by the Brighton and Hove Virtual School.

[Oral presentation] Annual Festival of Social Sciences, University of Brighton, 19th May 2016.

This presentation reports on emerging research findings of a co-created resilience building course for adults with mental health problems. This project is one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded Imagine: Social Context project (http://www.imaginecommunity.org.uk/projects/the-social-context/) which explores the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course was developed by a partnership of peer trainers, practitioners and an academic. Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems trained as tutors by a Recovery College. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving partnerships of health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). 

The course drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and evidence-based practice approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Emerging findings suggest this collaborative educative approach can effectively support resilience building. Secondly, contray to some individualising and responsibilising resilience discourses, powerful evidence emerged that participants identified with and valued the underpinning ecological model of resilience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lisa Williams Keynote, Mental Health and The System, Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0088B2A0-909E-44CF-A48E-E0655B7363A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lisa Williams delivered a keynote at the Leeds Conference to support understanding of the importance of context and the impact on mental health. 100% positive evaluation and lots of debates and interest.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Boingboing Twitter Account</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E990BCC-4BEB-4879-BA18-D7438F46FA9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Boingboing Twitter account was set up in 2012 to inform people about resilience related news and to inform people about the work that Boingboing Social Enterprise and the University of Brighton are involved in.

The forum was lead by members of the Blackpool HeadStart team (HeadStart is a &amp;pound;75m programme funded by the Big Lottery Fund to build the emotional resilience of young people aged 10-16). The Blackpool HeadStart Partnership shared their resilience model which helps explore potential resources available for young people to build their resilience individually, within their family, school and community. This new and innovative approach to applying resilience theory in practice is highly thought provoking and begins with the question 'What can we change together, so children and young people can flourish and belong?' 25 people attended the forum including a couple of people from Public Health England, who are developing a position statement on Adolescent Resilience to support local authorities to implement their approaches . There were also YoungMinds staff, someone from the Department of Health, a smattering of freelance consultants and NHS doctors and some young people on work experience at YoungMinds from various other London-based charities making up the 25 strong audience.

1. Gather evidence-based ideas for what they can do to increase their own happiness
2. Explore ways of applying what they learn to their own lives
3. Acquire ideas about how to share more happiness with those they care about
4. Develop a clearer commitment to taking action to support their own happiness and the happiness of those they care about

Session led to discussion and questions and further project work with some of the participants.

The Experience in Mind group asked for further training as they felt it had helped them manage their mental health. As a result, they co-wrote a book on mental health for parents and delivered training to practitioners and parents. The Experience in Mind Group changed its name to Art in Mind and Art in Mind co-wrote two research bids with the Brighton Uni team.

[Seminar presentation] 40th College of Occupational Therapists Annual Conference, Harrogate 28th -30th June 2016.

This presentation reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of a co-created resilience building course for adults with mental health problems. This innovative service development is also one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded project which aims to explore the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course comprised 8 weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers and occupational therapists (practitioners and an academic). Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who have been recruited and trained as tutors by a Recovery College in England. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). People who attend Recovery College courses are seen as 'learners' not, for instance, as service users, clients or carers.

The course content drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and occupational approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Findings suggest that Peer Trainers and Occupational Therapists (academics and practitioners in this educative practice model) have compatible knowledge, skills and experience that enable them to collaborate in Recovery College courses and effectively support resilience building.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.brighton.ac.uk/healthsciences/2016/07/16/resilience-workshop-occupational-therapy/#more-363</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited workshop on resilience practice and research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF34A8AC-FA22-4FB1-AF19-34FF3B7CA5B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The audience was a mixed range of professionals - managers practitioners and commissioners and people with learning disabilities through the self advocacy programme.

Drawing on their own experiences in co-productive research, as well as the experiences of those attending the session, they discussed ways in which individuals and communities can be supported to make 'resilient moves' aimed at transforming not just individuals but also the communities, organisations and environments in which we all live and work.

Students are based in the workplace and as well as learning English and Maths they learn employability skills and go on work placements every day to prepare them for a real paid job. It has tremendous success rates and is something that is growing in popularity in the UK and Europe.

This innovative service development is also one site of a wider multi-national UK research council funded project which aims to explore the potential for community university partnerships to make better and more resilient collective futures. The course comprised 8 weekly sessions developed by a partnership of peer trainers and occupational therapists (practitioners and an academic). Peer trainers are people with lived experience of mental health problems who have been recruited and trained as tutors by a Recovery College in England. Recovery Colleges are a growing initiative involving a partnership of the health service providers and service user organisations underpinned by a collaborative recovery orientated philosophy using an educative approach (Perkins et al 2012). People who attend Recovery College courses are seen as 'learners' not, for instance, as service users, clients or carers.

The course content drew on an adapted version of the Resilience Framework (Hart et al 2007) and a range of other resilience tools and models alongside the personal, practice and research expertise of the facilitators. It aimed to increase learners' resilience to respond on an individual and collective basis to the adversities they faced using internal and external resources and supports. This was achieved by combining lived experience expertise of mental health recovery and occupational approaches. The impact of the course was evaluated using qualitative data (eg interviews, course notes and products) and quantitative data (eg resilience scales). Findings suggest that Peer Trainers and Occupational Therapists (academics and practitioners in this educative practice model) have compatible knowledge, skills and experience that enable them to collaborate in Recovery College courses and effectively support resilience building.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sussexrecoverycollege.org.uk/courses/brighton-and-hove-campus/1-courses/115-resilience</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Resilience in young people: How can participation in enjoyable, structured activities help? - Kristina Usaite (Eastbourne) - 18 February 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6F74168-75C0-47B2-BD38-E331289ABC60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The speaker presented to a mixed audience of 20 people her research investigating how retired professionals from a range of disciplines have used participation in structured activities (often leisure/learning) to help young people respond to the challenges they face and support their resilience.

The session explored the transformation of mental distress from the exotic unknowable requiring technologies of government and self, available only through Psy practitioners, to a fundamentally social feature of modern living, drawing upon a number of empirical case studies around the UK where opportunities, comfort, a sense of meaning and social support are facilitated for suffering people in a way that statutory and biomedical services find difficult, where environments are presented that provide experiences of help, identity transformation and community without waiting behind a glass partition. Carl suggested a need to step outside the statutory and community institutions of mainstream mental health to explore the ways in which the amelioration of suffering can meaningfully occur through alternative social contexts and community arenas.

Consistent positive feedback from front-line practitioners and parent carers indicates that their day-to-day work has been directly influenced by the provision of opportunities to learn about resilience theory and the RT approach. Evaluations demonstrate RT has increased their confidence and feelings of effectiveness. Collaborative relationships between university and community partners are being sustained through social enterprise activities coordinated by a new Community Interest Company and a dedicated website www.boingboing.org.uk, has increased access to resilience based information and resources. National policy teams, senior civil servants and ministers, a leading national charity, community organisations, local authorities, academics, front line staff and parent carers have increased their understanding of resilience and Resilient Therapy, integrating the learning into their respective policy, teaching, research, workplace and home based settings. The mental health and skills (in training, writing and policy work) of young people with complex health difficulties has been enhanced and an RT toolkit for parents made available for free download. Statutory and third sector agencies have embedded RT in their organisations, with staff teams reporting the benefits of a 'shared language' and strengths based strategic approach in their work with children and families. RT is more securely rooted in the School of Nursing and Midwifery and related teaching curricula. Students report favourably on the inclusion of resilience concepts in their mentoring workshops and provide enthusiastic feedback about the positive benefits to community practitioners and parents teaching on university courses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Resilient Therapy (RT) Learning Programme suitable for diverse audiences has been tested, refined and now operational. The suite of information and training sessions reached 3230 individuals. 2. Community Interest Company created and managed jointly by academic and community partners. Dedicated website www.boingboing.org.uk received 18,000 hits since launch in June 2010, which is growing exponentially as our work develops. 3. Meetings with policy leads at DoH and DfE led to: ? Work cited (1:3 UK practice examples) in internal ministers briefing paper in relation to the implementation of the Coalition Government's white paper 'Healthy Lives, Healthy People' DH 2010 ? Resilience evidence base included in DfE internal briefing paper for mental health leads on children's emotional wellbeing and mental health for the Secretary of State for Education ? Briefing paper produced and widely circulated to Children, Families and Maternity division within DH, responsible for development of the Health Visitor Implementation Plan 2011, making a case for resilient practice amongst socially disadvantaged families. 4. RT toolkit for parents of young people with mental health difficulties produced and disseminated. 5. RT fully integrated into the manualised Insiders Guide Parent Support Course being rolled out to parent organisations across the UK. 6. Practice based community university collaborations expanded as result of project. Placement fellowship created with a community organisation for the length of the project continues, and RT has been embedded in the work of three additional community organisations. 7. Resilience evidence base and RT included in University courses and mentoring schemes.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>195B1F40-CB00-486E-AFAF-A7F84FE642FA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-189-25-0030/outputs/read/2d93a5f1-6d93-4dd7-bead-c5db1bdc0d9e</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited member Public Health England expert round table</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1199637C-B5A6-4FBB-83C5-E55B63E1D555</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert advisors to: Developing Resilience in Practice: A Health Visiting Framework 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>215E8868-EEB8-4060-A09C-AA184BDF1E4E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ihv.org.uk/uploads/iHV_Practitioner%20Document_AW%20WEB%2030.04.15.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited expert contributor to brief for the USA's Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's funding scheme on adolescence resilience</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20E2136B-03F8-44DE-9EFC-2842D28F8307</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited member Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Mental Health Expert Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5AD9984D-6CF2-44CE-B07A-D96173B8564D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited member of Horizon 2020 Societal Challenge Six Expert Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11691E21-C3C6-4144-88B4-37B7120E462C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Practitioner, citizen, service user and policy maker training in resilience-based practice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>812ABCAE-372F-4DF0-8B16-DBF99072B670</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All formal evaluations of training provision reported increased confidence and understanding of resilience based approaches.

We took the resilience research evidence base and put it together with other sets of ideas gleaned from our practice with very disadvantaged children and families in an NHS Child and Adolescent Mental Health Clinic. Alongside this, Angie's adoptive parenting knowledge went into the mix and, we've collected experiences from those we are working with in our RT Communities of Practice.

We distilled all these different sets of ideas into a handy RT table that summarises our approach and acts as a reminder to people of what's included. Practitioners and parents use the table to plan strategic moves with children. We've also been developing a version of the table for use with adults, and this is where we've got to so far with that, which is still work in progress, the Resilience Framework for adults.

Our Aims and Objectives

To actively promote an appreciation and understanding of resilience research and practice for the benefit of supporting children, young people, families and adults exposed to social disadvantage.

So, how do we do this?

By working in collaboration with university, third sector and statutory partners plus parents, young people and service users, we plan to:

- Establish a virtuous learning cycle between research, education and practice
- Work with individuals to weave resilience-based practice into their daily practice
- Deliver training on the resilience research evidence base and practical approaches to resilience building
- Produce resilience learning and practice resources
- Involve community partners in the work
- Promote the benefits of a resilient approach
- Encourage the development of resilience research that includes the most disadvantaged in our society</gtr:description><gtr:id>32A54F23-AD89-484B-ACFC-2C595FFD1C2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All the
