The integrity and logic of the ageing body and everyday practices may become questioned, the taken-for-granted nature of embodiment challenged, and people in mid to later life may increasingly be required to make sense of biographical and bodily changes in order to maintain and/or re-negotiate a sense of &amp;nbsp;'ontological security'. Previous research into ageing has however often inadvertently dislocated the experiences of ageing and personal meanings away from the everyday worlds and communities in which people live. The aim of this project is instead to reassert the significance of the ordinary and day-to-day by focusing on everyday meanings, lived experiences and spatio-temporal contexts. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project involves a diverse sample of 60 men and women aged between 50 and 70 years with different daily routines (work, non-work and voluntary). Data collection methods include participants taking photographs of aspects of their daily lives followed by in-depth interviews. The photographs become a form of a 'visual diary' as a means to explore the photographs, meanings, practices and spatio-temporal contexts of daily life. In particular, the research aims to be much closer to lived experiences in order to explore how people give meaning and engage with their everyday worlds.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>255809</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In collaboration with the Brunel Arts Centre, Dr Wendy Martin (School of Health Sciences and Social Care) and George Mogg (Arts Centre) presented an interactive photographic exhibition that highlighted photographs from the weekly visual diaries from an ESRC funded research project. The project titled 'Photographing Everyday Life: Ageing, Lived Experiences, Time and Space' sought to explore the method of photography as a means to map, explore and document the daily and lived experiences and meanings of people in mid to later life.

Within the exhibition we created the space of a lounge, a garden, a series of installations, mosaics, photographic images and digitised displays with the aim to portray our research findings in an interactive, creative and engaging way. We also collected ideas, images and feedback from the audiences who interacted with the exhibition. The photographic exhibition thereby provided a space to engage with ideas around daily life and ageing and we present aspects of the photographic exhibition to promote further debate, insights and engagement with the images and research. 

The exhibition was well received with 85 attendees at the research talks and about 85 more viewing the exhibition only. Participants from the research attended and provided feedback

The ESRC-funded research project 'Photographing Everyday Life: Ageing, Lived Experiences, Time and Space' involved a diverse sample of 62 women and men aged 50 years and over who took photographs of their different daily routines to create a weekly diary. The exhibition show-cased the results and was a backdrop to a week of events at the library associated with the research project. The Mayor of Hillingdon, Cllr Catherine Dann opened the exhibition at a well-attended launch reception on the evening of Monday 3rd November. Prof Mary Gilhooly, theme leader for Healthy Ageing within the Institute of the Environment, Health and Societies gave top tips from research on healthy living and ways to increase your chances of living to 100 years and over. The week continued with busy, bustling coffee mornings, opportunities to meet the Researchers, Dr Wendy Martin (Brunel University London) and Dr Katy Pilcher (Aston University), research talks and presentations and Digital Drop-In Clinics where Brunel London students helped members of the public with their digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops and cameras.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E984D364-7A0A-4E2A-B76F-3D6F58FD8CDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Thomas Ryan, Corporate Relations Officer said &amp;quot;The event has been so successful that the library has asked us to keep the exhibition there until further notice. We hope to arrange further exhibitions at Uxbridge Library in the future and to continue the Digital Drop-In Clinics on a once a month basis.&amp;quot;

The photography exhibition itself received a large footfall and displayed a creative and interesting window into people's daily lives. Photographic mosaics cleverly incorporated hundreds of small photographs of everyday scenes into a large themed photograph. A rolling slide show of photographs was displayed on the screens throughout the library and a washing line of small snap shots creatively displayed the outdoor everyday activities of the participants.

Dr. Wendy Martin, Principal Investigator, said &amp;quot;Producing the exhibition was a way of giving something back to our research participants and to showcase our research to the wider public. Most of the participants came along at some point during the week to see their photographic work displayed. We have received wonderful feedback and many have told me that the whole experience has been very reflective and thought provoking. People wandering through the library have been captivated by images of the ordinary and everyday, that often resonate with their own daily lives, images that can also challenge stereotypes of ageing. &amp;quot;

Drop-In Clinics where Brunel London students helped members of the public with their digital devices such as mobile phones, laptops and cameras was so successful that it became a long term project between Uxbridge Library and Brunel University London with monthly drop-in sessions led by student volunteers</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Festival of Social Science.

The world's population is ageing. One in four people are expected to be over the age of 65 in the next two decades, making 'the senior citizen' the largest demographic group in the Western World. At the same time that we are expected to live longer, there has been a proliferation of digital devices, information technologies and mediated systems of communication that network populations globally. How ageing populations, and those in later life, are experiencing a world that is increasingly mediated by the proliferation of digital devices is the primary focus of our research project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The international partnership is led by Concordia University and involves 12 universities in 8 different countries (Canada, America, Peru, Romania, Spain, UK, Holland, Malaysia) and is a multi-disciplinary network to explore and develop two key areas for future research: the digital and ageing. 

In particular, the partnership brings together community partners from each of the countries to explore and understand the emergent area of digiial technologies and later life</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The contribution of the project to international partnership was to build upon one emergent theme that showed the increasing importance of digital connectivity and the ways in which people in mid to later life actively engage (and resist) technologies of communication in their daily lives. These findings challenged the predominant view that people in mid to later life are passive users of digital technologies.

The research project also contributed the development of creative methodologies (visual diaries), the dissemination of social data via the means of the arts and humanities, and an understanding and exploration of the use of digital technologies in everyday life.

The exhibition initially created as a way to portray our findings among our research participants, as a way to give back for their participation, and enable their reflections on both the research topic - ageing and everyday life - and to allow them to provide feedback on our findings. 'Photographing Everyday Life' was also a free public exhibition at both the British Library and the Uxbridge Library. The exhibition has been on show for nearly 2 years in total and has led to numerous invitations to talk on public engagement and ways to present social science data via the arts and humanities. In this context, the photographic exhibition has led to a significant visual non-academic impact from the research. The key areas in which the photographic exhibition has led to cultural and societal changes has been by: (1) the challenge to stereotypes around old age through the portrayal of images of the ordinary mundane and everyday and showing the diversity of daily routines and practices; and (2) the questioning and reflections around meanings and practices of everyday life, for while the images portrayed the ordinary habitual and the familiar, to see an exhibition about the everyday within everyday public spaces was considered unusual to the people who came across the images in their own daily lives. The photographic exhibition has therefore resulted in significant cultural and societal non-academic impact and has been highly visible in public and ordinary everyday arenas. 

'Photographing Everyday Life' is an exhibition that highlights some of the photographs taken by research participants in mid-to-later life. Participants created a weekly visual diary exploring the rhythms, patterns and meanings that underlie our habitual and routinized daily lives. The exhibition presents the photographs in a creative and novel format. Within the exhibition we created a series of installations, mosaics, photographic images and digitised displays with the aim to portray our research findings on daily life in an interactive, creative and engaging way. We also collected ideas, images, insights and feedback from audiences who interacted with the exhibition. The exhibition therefore provided a way to disseminate social science data via the arts and humanities and enhance public engagement.

The photographic exhibition draws on a research database of visual diaries from the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council) funded project: Photographing Everyday Life: Ageing, Lived Experiences, Time and Space. It represents ordinary and everyday images of daily life that question and challenge the predominant stereotypical and alternative positive and negative images of ageing.

PHOTOGRAPHIC EXHIBITION: PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 

September 2015 - May 2017. Discovery Trail 18 (Mary Seacole Building, 1st Floor Mezzanine) The photographic exhibition is part of the 50th Anniversary celebrations at Brunel University London. http://fifty.brunel.ac.uk/discovery-trail/18-photographing-everyday-life/ The exhibition is predominately viewed by students in the allied health professions and allows them to explore and question the nature of ageing and everyday life that may influence their understandings and therefore their practice. 

November 2014 to February 2015. ESRC Festival of Social Science, Uxbridge Library, London Borough of Hillingdon. As part of the national ESRC Festival of Social Science the research was presented at Uxbridge Library, London Borough of Hillingdon as a free public exhibition. The photographic exhibition was opened by the Mayor of Hillingdon, Cllr Catherine Dann, and also involved an opening reception, research talks, digital drop in clinics led by Brunel University London students and coffee mornings. See: http://sites.brunel.ac.uk/photographingdailylives/aphotographicexhibition. The digital drop in clinics led to a long term collaboration between student volunteers from Brunel University London who assisted members of the public at Uxbridge library with their digital devices. Of particular note, was the way in which members of the public would come across the images in exhibition that resulted in reflections on their own daily routines and practices. 

May 2014. British Library, London. Dr Wendy Martin presented alongside the photographic exhibition at the public engagement event: &amp;quot;Portraying Ageing: Cultural Assumptions and Practical Implications&amp;quot;, held at the British Library Conference Centre on Monday 28 April 2014. See: http://socialwelfare.bl.uk/resources-tools/portraying14.aspx. This led to a wide range of members of the public viewing and reflecting upon the images and their own ideas and meanings about ageing and everyday life. 

June 2013. Interactive Photographic Exhibition, Michael Sterling Atrium, Brunel University London. Towards the end of the ESRC funded project Photographing Everyday Life: Ageing, Lived Experiences, Time and Space we created and disseminated our key findings via an interactive photographic exhibition at Michael Sterling Atrium, Brunel University London. The photographic exhibition was a collaboration with Brunel Arts Centre, an independent Artist and involved the active engagement of our participants. Within the exhibition we created a series of installations, mosaics, photographic images and digitised displays with the aim to portray our research findings in an interactive, creative and engaging way. We also collected ideas, images, insights and feedback from the audiences who interacted with the exhibition. The exhibition was well received with 85 attendees at the research talks and about 85 more viewing the exhibition only. The feedback was positive with participants enjoying seeing their own photographs, an opportunity to re-think the habitual and everyday and an exploration of the use of photography.
