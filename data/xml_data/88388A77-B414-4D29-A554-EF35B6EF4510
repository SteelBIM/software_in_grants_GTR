Competition law seeks to regulate the market behaviour of businesses, for instance by prohibiting the abuse of monopoly power and the creation of cartels. A typical price-fixing cartel involves collusion between would-be competitors who agree to fix prices at levels above the competitive price, making excessive profits at the expense of consumers and society generally. EU and UK competition law have traditionally been enforced virtually exclusively by an administrative body, for instance by the imposition of considerable fines. These fines do not compensate directly any of the victims of the competition law infringements. The historical primacy of administrative enforcement in Europe is in stark contrast with US competition law ('antitrust law') where private enforcement constitutes the vast majority of antitrust enforcement. The availability of a well-developed system of class actions has ensured that private enforcement is extremely effective and can result in end-consumers being compensated for their losses. The US system emphasises the importance of consumer rights, an aspect which appears to be lacking in the EU. A Commission White Paper published in April 2008 made a number of interesting proposals to facilitate and harmonise competition litigation across the Community. Reform of the UK system was also proposed by the OFT in its 2007 Recommendations, not as yet implemented. Both sets of proposals in particular consider ways of faciltating consumer redress.\nThere has been to date no comprehensive or systematic study of the case-law in which competition law issues have arisen in private litigation across the Member State legal systems, and this project will fill this lacuna. The project will be collaborative, with rapporteurs for each EU Member State and expert economic and comparative legal input. Each rapporteur will identify and provide details of all competition law cases before Member State courts over a period of ten years, in order to provide a comprehensive analysis of all competition law-related private litigation across the EU. This will allow for a clearer and fuller understanding of the obstacles to effective private enforcement, particularly in relation to consumers, and encourage learning and sharing of best practice. A recent cut-off point is necessary, and as Regulation 1/2003 came into force on 1 May 2004, and sought to enhance the role of the national courts in EU competition law enforcement, the intention is to consider all cases within the five year period either side of this date, i.e. 1 May 1999-30 April 2009. An economic overview of differences in procedural rules from an incentives perspective and a comparative review of differences in legal systems, litigation behaviour and other independent variables in a number of States will help us understand the legal context in which private enforcement exists, how it has been constrained and may be facilitated.\nThis is a vitally important period for this research to be undertaken and disseminated, as private enforcement is viewed by competition authorities and practitioners as a key element of a more competitive UK and European economy. The proposed research will inform ongoing policy debates at the EU and UK following the Commission White Paper and OFT recommendations, which suggested ways of facilitating private competition litigation and access to justice for consumers. The research will thus be of value to academics, practitioners, the judiciary, consumer organisations, business, policy makers and public enforcement agencies. DG Competition of the European Commission and the UK Office of Fair Trading have indicated their strong support for the proposed research, and it will allow the OFT to learn from developments in other Member States to enhance access to justice, the competition litigation system, and indirectly competitiveness, in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will lead indirectly to enhanced economic competitiveness across the European Union and within the UK in particular. It will add to our understanding of the extent to which private enforcement acts as a deterrent to anti-competitive activity, which damages society, and inform the debate on how private enforcement can be further facilitated and encouraged to ensure that competition law rights are effective and enable consumer redress. It was recognised in the 2004 Ashurst Report that private damages actions across the EU were in a state of 'astonishing diversity and total underdevelopment'. It is important to ascertain the extent to which this may be changing, what key obstacles still remain, to learn from different jurisdictions about how they can be tackled, and the extent to which these measures have been successful, as demonstrated by case-law trends. The research will enlighten about all aspects of the development of private enforcement of competition law across the EU, and indirectly facilitate a greater deterrent threat to anti-competitive behaviour through policy learning and development and thereby indirectly lead to benefits for the competitive nature of the UK and wider European economy.\nThe research will lend itself to significant knowledge transfer, and the findings will impact on the various stakeholders in the following ways:-\nPublic agencies and policy-makers- the research will provide greater information for the public sector bodies and policy-makers responsible for competition policy across the EU, notably the European Commission and the Office of Fair Trading in the UK. The research will inform their ongoing policy debate and reform processes. To date, the policy developments have been informed only by a limited consideration of one aspect of competition litigation. A comprehensive overview will help policy-makers to understand the wider context in which competition claims may be raised.\nConsumer organisations (e.g. the UK Consumers' Association)- there has been only one action raised in the UK under the specific consumer representative action provision, which was settled out of court and generally considered to reflect the weakness of the provision. Consideration of the legal mechanisms and extent of redress across the EU will inform as to how the position may be improved and enhance the position of damaged consumers for the future in the UK and across the EU- a key focus of the project.\nBusinesses which are the victims of anti-competitive infringements, by enhancing awareness of the availability of legal redress and informing the debate as to how these rights can be more effectively guaranteed in the future, in particular through the auspices of the Federation of Small Businesses and the European Small Business Alliance.\nLawyers and other professionals who practise in the area of competition law, primarily solicitors, barristers and judges. The research will inform them as to developing trends, comparative developments and develop shared learning from other legal systems and enhance their capacity to engage in the policy reform debate at domestic and EU levels. \nAt the conference at versions of the national reports will be presented, representatives of each group of beneficiaries will be invited to attend and provide input to the reports and project generally. The research, its development and outcomes will also be publicised via the project website. The Principal Investigator is a member of the Competition Law Scholars' Forum and the Scottish Competition Law Forum, and the knowledge generated by the study will be disseminated through these networks. The findings will be further disseminated in professional conference papers, workshops, short briefing papers and professional journals; and by conference papers and the publication of a monograph and analytical articles in peer-review journa</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>106405</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East Anglia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
