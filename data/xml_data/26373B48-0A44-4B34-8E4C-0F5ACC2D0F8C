In comparison with steel (7.8 g/cc), they have higher strength to weight ratio. 90% of aluminium shape castings are based on these Al-Si alloys and currently, ~ 5 million tonnes per annum are being used in automotive industry. The average car manufactured in 2006 contained between 110-145 kg of Aluminium, compared to ~1000 Kg of Steel. Life cycle analysis suggest that, a 100 kg weight reduction through substituting Steel with Aluminium parts would result in a saving of 900 litres of petrol during the car's life span (200,000 km) and 2,000Kg of CO2 savings (10 g/km). The big problem for the light metal industry in increasing the further use of these lightweight Al-Si alloys with respect to replacing steel in the transport sector is the lack of ductility and yield strength associated with the large grain structure, defects and large intermetallic particles. Since Al-Si alloys are difficult to grain refine, widespread adoption is currently constrained due to excessive casting defects and inadequate mechanical properties. Higher Si levels in these alloys results in large grains, which make casting difficult, thus resulting in very high rejection rates, up to 60% for high value critical components. 

Ti based grain refiners used for non-cast (wrought) Al alloys are less effective in cast Al-Si alloys due to reaction between Si and Ti. Brunel has invented an effective grain refiner that can revolutionize the foundry casting process for these Al-Si casting alloys, significantly reducing the casting defects and producing superior mechanical properties that, despite (deliberately) limited publicity, is already generating significant market interest within the materials supply chain. The Brunel grain refiner (BGR) improves castability of a wide range of aluminium alloys; eliminates hot-tearing, a common problem in castings; it improves much needed tensile strength and ductility; improves homogeneity in mechanical properties across the component; it enables thin-wall cast structures; and it tolerates high impurity levels (aluminium scrap can now be manufactured with superior properties). Additionally, it is expected to enable the casting of large and complex shaped structures using sand moulds and reduce the high (up to 60%) rejection rate during manufacture of high value components.

The unique selling points of the Brunel Grain refiner are that it is highly effective for bulk castings and easily employable by the industry. Currently there exists no effective grain refiner for Al-Si castings and previously difficult to produce high performance bulk castings without defects can now be easily processed.

Delivering benefits to a wide range of casting techniques, it should enable the production of castings with superior properties, allowing aluminium to replace a growing proportion of steel parts in the automotive sector. This will put the UK in the forefront of metallurgical technological developments. Very substantial environmental benefits are foreseen due to light-weighting and concomitant reductions in energy consumed and CO2 emitted.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Brunel has developed a novel grain refiner for aluminium-silicon alloys that refines both primary aluminium and silicon eutectic phases, which results in several advantages over current methods of grain refinement. The impact on casting technology would be significant. The Brunel Grain Refiner (BGR) provides fine grain structure at wide range of cooling rates, better fluidity during casting owing to the lack of large grains interfering with flow, less porosity with higher ductility, strength and toughness. The advantages in the casting operation would include; better process yield through reducing variation from melt to melt; less material used within runners and biscuits, meaning less internal recycling and dross loss; and less extremes in tooling temperature in die casting leading to higher tool life. 

Weight savings through the use of high performance Aluminum-Silicon castings, fabricated with BGR technology, are expected to create new market opportunities in casting new automotive components that have never been cast before. The current market size for automotive Al castings in UK, EU and worldwide are 0.07 mt, 2.8 mt and 5.2 mt respectively. Market size for BGR technology is estimated to be up to &amp;pound; 3 billion p.a.. Since adapting BGR would require no capital equipment investment for foundries, and little if any process changes, the market for casting is projected to be doubled in ten years. Volume car makers have identified that there is a huge potential for replacing steel parts, with Al provided the Al-Si castings are produced with higher strength and ductility, in an economical way. BGR has this potential due to the simple nature of the manufacturing process. 

Current rejection rate during manufacturing process varies between 5% and 60% depending on nature of applications. This high rejection rate for high value castings should be much reduced. Considering that BGR offers, reduced porosity and macro-defects, the rejection rate during manufacturing would b minimal (&amp;lt;5%).

Impact on academic would be through academic publications, news letters, magazines focussed on light metals industry work, presentation and exhibitions at international Aluminium conferences. 

By 2020, it is expected that there would be 1.2 billion cars worldwide. A 100 Kg weight reduction can result in 2.4 billion tons of CO2 savings (2 tonnes/car lifespan) by 2030, thus benefiting the planet's environment.

BGR allows direct recycling of aluminium alloy scrap that contains higher levels of impurities, so that post consumer Al alloy scrap as a valuable materials resource can be directly applicable for lightweight body &amp;amp; powertrain applications. This will make the UK less dependent on imports of expensive primary metal and contribute significantly to a lower environmental impact by re-balancing the flow of materials through the UK economy and reducing landfill and emissions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>121144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote speaker at International Symposium on Aspects of Mechanical Engineering and Technology for Industry, India, NERIST, Itanagar, India, December 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>649A0C35-D134-420D-9241-177E23495BEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 500 international (but majority from India) have attended the conference.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ameti2014.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited lecture at International Congress &quot;Non-ferrous metals and minerals-2015, Russia, Sept'2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5085A170-256C-4D40-A40E-F0F9602F0A05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 1000 participants working on non-ferrous metals have attended the seminar.

Pictured from left: Hari-Babu Nadendla, Magdalena Nowak, IOM3 President Mike Hicks, and Leandro Bolzoni.

The annual Award, now in its 38th year, is sponsored by Companhia Brasileira de Metalurgia e Minera&amp;ccedil;&amp;atilde;o (CBMM). This is only the second occasion the award has been made for work on aluminium-based materials. Over the last 20 years significant progress has been made in vehicle light-weighting through the use of advanced high strength steels. This has allowed automotive manufacturers to meet increasingly stringent EU automobile emission targets. Further progress in this area will require the use of other light-weight materials, including aluminium alloys. To maximise the benefits available from the use of cast aluminium components it is important to optimise strength levels and minimise property variability. This can be achieved by refining the microstructure in the cast product.

The 2016 Charles Hatchett Award winning work focuses on the development of Nb-B based inoculants for use in the production of aluminium alloy castings. These inoculants were shown to be effective in widely-used commercial Al-Si casting alloys, especially when the Si content is higher than 5%. Above this level of Si, conventional Ti-B inoculants lose their effectiveness as a grain refiner. Significant refinement of the cast microstructure was obtained over a broad range of cooling rates, encompassing those found in common casting methods such as die- and sand-casting.

The award winners, from Brunel University London, UK were presented with their medals at the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (IOM3) dinner held in London on the 12th July.

The following day, the lead author, Dr N. Hari Babu, presented the winning project at a seminar held at the Royal Society of Chemistry. The international seminar &amp;quot;Niobium for Aluminium Cast Parts in Automotive Components&amp;quot;, sponsored by CBMM, was attended by experts from the automotive supply chain and academia. The presentation described the fundamental metallurgy behind the design of the novel Nb-B inoculants and demonstrated their effectiveness in producing microstructure refinement at the laboratory scale.

The seminar was chaired by Dr Naila Croft from Beta Technology, the UK based company which manages the annual award process on behalf of CBMM. As International Coordinator of the Award, Dr Croft commented &amp;quot;We were delighted to host over 40 delegates in London for our important technical seminar. The speakers have described the initial development of the novel Nb-B inoculants. However, by bringing together representatives from academia and the automotive supply chain, the route to full commercial implementation of this development has been demonstrated.&amp;quot;

Marcos Stuart, CBMM's Director of Technology also noted &amp;quot;This international award is part of our activities to recognise excellence in research on niobium and its applications. There is no single solution to vehicle light-weighting, the important thing is to have the right material in the right place. There are technical and cost challenges to the adoption of large aluminium alloy castings, such as engine blocks, which include efficiently filling the moulds during the casting process. The Nb-B inoculant refines the grains, improving the fluidity of the material being cast, and therefore making it easier to completely fill the moulds, leading to a higher integrity product. It is now up to the supply chain to act to ensure the adoption of this exciting new technology.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://player.vimeo.com/video/205944823</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Materials in Car Body Engineering, Automotive Circle International</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B9F8F54-2FFD-4419-A647-9BEDC490448C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Lecture is &amp;quot;Materials in Car Body Engineering&amp;quot; organised by automotive Circle International, Frankfurt, 21-23rd April 2015, Over 300 delegates from worldwide automotive OEMs (JLR, BMW, Audi, Ford, Honda, Toyota, Daimler, Hyundai, Fiat, Renault, Volvo etc) have attended this conference.
