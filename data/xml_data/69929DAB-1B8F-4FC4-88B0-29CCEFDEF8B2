needs with particular benefit to coastal regions that have limited local energy resources. Commercial wave
energy development in China is hampered by low wave power density levels between 2-7kW/m, an order of
magnitude less than the UK, yet suffers on average from more than 10 high intensity typhoon events a year,
causing extreme wind and wave conditions. This project aims to address the survivability of wave energy converters in Chinese waters during reoccurring high intensity typhoons. The research will explore the development of cost-effective mooring systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will directly benefit Chinese wave energy developers in their effort to design the most
cost-efficient, yet reliable systems possible in conditions of tropical cyclones. Specific stakeholder workshops
open to device developers and other interested parties are planned to establish a pathway to impact. If the
proposed research is successful, it will make wave technology in regions exposed to tropical cyclones more cost effective.
It also holds potential for applications in other areas (e.g. floating tidal or fish aquacultures). The
anticipated typhoon risk maps may benefit companies as well as the wider general public utilising or visiting
Chinese waters in reducing their likelihood of typhoon exposure. Finally, the work will benefit UK plc through
exports in technology and expertise.

Journal papers and conference contributions will increase the influence of the research.

To explore and enable further collaboration between the UK and China both teams, and the teams of other feasibility projects funded by this call, propose to align project specific meetings with workshops involving other research groups. Potential options that will be explored include the existing Oxford Tidal Energy Workshop is (typically around end March / early April) and the PRIMARE research workshop (tbc). This represents a forum for technical discussion of preliminary findings; Chinese partners are invited. An earlier workshop is also proposed in China to enable discussion of feasibility project progress and explore wider collaboration opportunities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>127133</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>State Key Laboratory of Tropical Oceanography</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>SCSIO</gtr:description><gtr:id>DDD54785-9E98-42B2-9D6E-9C5BF14CE004</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Detailed technical report on typhoon frequencies and load impacts / mitigation for marine energy devices

China is actively developing its approach to marine energy, making this a key juncture at which British companies and universities can make an impactful statement of intent as world leaders in the field.

The visit will provided opportunities to meet key stakeholders in this emerging industry-including prominent State Owned Enterprises looking at investment, innovative private companies, leading research institutions, and key policy makers at the provincial and national level.

They also informed offshore engineers and naval architects about the possibility and extent to which extreme mooring loads may be mitigated through novel mooring components. 

The demonstrated feasibility of novel mooring systems has lead to joint industry project efforts with offshore wind developers, such as MingYang Wind Power. 

The research results were presented at the Department for International Trade (DIT) 'Powering The Future event' in Shanghai, China on 23/09/2016.

Most recently the results have been used to progress UK-China marine energy collaborations as part of a China-Britain Business Council organised mission to marine energy test sites in China, during 15/02-17/02/2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D69D29E9-A2D7-4CEF-8E2A-C0BC86CCB387</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Wave energy technology in China could potentially contribute 13GW of installed power to the country's energy needs with particular benefit to coastal regions that have limited local energy resources.

The collaborative research has quantified the engineering design envelope for typhoon conditions at the Danwanshan Island test site in China. The numerical modelling of a generic, heaving point absorber buoy compared the performance characteristics and mooring loads for conventional and novel mooring designs. The approach explored ideal, theoretical mooring behaviour, as well as practicable achievable behaviour. The physical testing has demonstrated the feasibility of such novel mooring systems to reduce the peak mooring loads in typhoon storm conditions, whilst not hindering the operational performance of the device. The physical tests have also improved and validated the numerical modelling of novel mooring concepts. 

The project has successfully established the research collaboration between the three partner institutions and associated researches, leading to continued research work, joint publications and collaborative funding applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Information on typhoon occurrence may be used by other users (e.g. shipping industry, environmental researchers).

Validated mooring performance is valuable for mooring developers and marine design engineers in order to potentially reduce peak and fatigue loads.
