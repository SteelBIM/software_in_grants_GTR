One class of promising materials are the transition metal oxides, featuring exotic phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, metal-insulator transitions, unusual magnetism and ferroelectricity. Among these, ferroelectric oxides--those possessing a switchable spontaneous polarisation--deserve special attention as they have a long track record of successful application in a wide range of technologies including ferroelectric random access memories, piezoelectric sensors and actuators, thermal imaging and non-linear optics. The properties of these materials, however, change dramatically when their dimensions are reduced to the nanometre scale, posing many challenges for their application but also offering new opportunities for engineering novel functionalities. In this project we will use state-of-the-art artificially layered epitaxial superlattices composed of ultrathin ferroelectric and non-ferroelectric oxides as a model system to study the poorly understood phenomenon of negative capacitance that has been proposed as a method for enhancing the surface potential in field-effect devices and surpassing the power requirement limitations of conventional CMOS transistors. We will conduct a detailed and systematic experimental study of the negative capacitance effect in a range of artificially layered materials, quantifying the effect, determining the optimum parameters for its observation and establishing the temperature range over which it is active. This work will pave the way to future realisation of prototype field-effect devices utilising the negative capacitance for performance enhancement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond the academic community, we expect the project to make an impact in the following areas:

Training of highly skilled professionals. 
One of the key areas of impact of this programme is the comprehensive training of graduates in a wide range of research-specific and transferrable skills. The technical expertise and independence gained during this programme will prepare prospective young academics for successful careers in scientific research in both academic and industrial settings. At the same time, the communication, analytic and other transferable skills acquired during the project will be highly valuable to the private sector, thus greatly improving the future employability of the individuals and contributing to UK's economy by providing new highly skilled professionals. Further details of the planned training are provided in the Pathways to Impact Statement.

Impact on the commercial sector. 
The fundamental research carried out during this project will be crucial in assessing the capacity for future exploitation of the negative capacitance effect in electronic devices (for example in improving the performance of field-effect transistors). As such, we expect the results to be of significant interest to the microelectronics industry and plan to investigate more applied aspects of this subject in subsequent projects in liaison with interested parties outside of academia. This project therefore has significant potential for generation of new intellectual property over the next 5 years and steps will be taken to create and exploit any opportunities related to development of new technologies arising from this research.

Outreach. 
While the technical aspects and potential benefits of this work can most easily be appreciated within academic circles and specific sectors of industry, we fully recognise the importance of engaging the general public who are the intended long-term beneficiaries of fundamental and applied research, the users of new technologies, and who influence, albeit indirectly, UK's research policy. We will therefore pursue various methods to communicate our research to non-academic audiences, including the publication of non-technical summaries online and/or in popular journals and exploiting opportunities for local and national media coverage. In addition, we will actively engage in outreach activities as part of an on-going UCL-wide effort to engage university students and high-school pupils in science though well-established as well as new programmes of work-experience placements, summer internships and summer schools.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99843</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have investigated the structural and electrical properties of artificially layered ferroelectric oxide superlattices with dense nanoscale domains.
