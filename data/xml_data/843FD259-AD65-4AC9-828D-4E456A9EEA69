environments for forestry</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I022183/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our vision: To impel climate change mitigation action by motivating private investments in sustainably managed forest ecosystem services. 
Our contribution: To address a critical KE gap between expertise on the mapping, modelling and quantification of the risk of forest carbon loss, and investor's confidence in forest investments (including in REDD+). 
Our focus: To address 4 categories of risks (i) Climatic (ii) Fire (iii) Anthropogenic and (iv) Regulatory. 
Our aim: To stimulate the exploitation of UK's world-class knowledge base -NERC and elsewhere - in forest loss and risk mapping by the UK knowledge brokers and financial institutions. 
Our impacts: To deliver, as a consequence of this work, a more accurate and holistic understanding of the real risk represented by forest propositions around the world; a more stable and mainstream investment environment for forestry and; to bring forestry from the margins of business, to a business line as common as aviation, motor or life and pensions. 

We request funding for a period of 12 months to support the creation of a ForestRisks-for-Finance Network. Partners, including WillisRE Ltd., ForestRe Ltd., Ecometrica Ltd, Acclimatise Ltd. The Edinburgh Centre on Climate Change, and Forest Research will contribute more than &amp;pound;55,000 in-cash and in-kind to this KE initiative. A PDRA will be appointed to effectively bring together the NERC funded and UK research community (on forest-loss risks) as well as to proactively engage with potential users (Brokers &amp;amp; End users). 

This initiative stems from (a) recommendations made at the NERC-funded Long Finance symposia on &amp;quot;Forestry and Finance: Where's the data&amp;quot; (London, July 2010 and Sept 2010), to which the PI (Patenaude) was an invited panellist and (b) the wider KE activities led by Richard Max-Lino (NERC Knowledge and Innovation Manager, Financial Services) and the Long Finance initiative (http://www.zyen.com/long-finance.html).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-11-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99283</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>LTS International Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hectares Indicator methodology</gtr:description><gtr:id>A706CBCE-A322-401C-8A03-C4FE535F6F64</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>DFID is the UK Government department responsible for leading the UK?s work to end extreme poverty, by fostering inclusive economic growth and sustainable development.

In addition, ForestRe will be a partner to the new NERC PURE project (NE/M008541/1) that arose out of the Forest Finance Risk Network which will work with ForestRe to develop potential insurance products for drought and pest and diseases which are currently largely absent from the market.

Existing research focuses on historic trends in P&amp;amp;D and individual P&amp;amp;D. The Woodland Carbon Code is the standard for woodland carbon projects in the UK and is developed by the Forestry Commission. Not all carbon sequestered in these projects can be sold as carbon credits. Some carbon has to be set aside against future losses. As part of the calculation some carbon has to be set aside against losses from P&amp;amp;D. This model therefore looks at the current and future P&amp;amp;D threats and provides the first model that attempts to quantify the risks from all of these and provide a single overall potential % loss to the woodland carbon projects over the next 100 years from them. This model is interactive and provides a tool that can be made to make decision on the adequacy of the buffer.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0D5F9EB-F527-46A3-8552-32AD40924FAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The model was funded by the first PURE Associates call (PA 13-021). The Forestry Commission and Forest Research have both looked at the model and it has already influenced debate on how to assess future risks from P&amp;amp;D. The researcher has spoken once at a technical seminar at Forest Research on the model and is to speak again in December at the Forestry Commission to an audience of staff working in the plant health area. Pat Snowdon, Head of Economics and Climate Change, was the partner to the PURE project and described the model to the Defra Chief Scientist who has asked for more information. A report is being finalised for him to this end. The team successfully applied for follow on funding from the NERC PURE call to embed the outputs of this model in the operational procedures for the woodland carbon code and to adapt the model for wider use in the forest sector and also for insurance purposes. This project is underway (NE/M008541/1). The idea and demand for the model came out of the Forest Finance Risk Network projects, as did the collaborative partnership for the new PURE project. Network members will contribute to the development of the model</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pest and Disease Model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/611BAE51-4363-456C-81B9-A6EF63B5F5D8"><gtr:id>611BAE51-4363-456C-81B9-A6EF63B5F5D8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling wind risk to Eucalyptus globulus (Labill.) stands</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forest Ecology and Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/70c249a4ac14b5ad5b843c106793563d"><gtr:id>70c249a4ac14b5ad5b843c106793563d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Locatelli T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/64660BD8-7273-4153-B3C0-C1496E200A0D"><gtr:id>64660BD8-7273-4153-B3C0-C1496E200A0D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Variance-based sensitivity analysis of a wind risk model - Model behaviour and lessons for forest modelling</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental Modelling &amp; Software</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/70c249a4ac14b5ad5b843c106793563d"><gtr:id>70c249a4ac14b5ad5b843c106793563d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Locatelli T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/I022183/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
