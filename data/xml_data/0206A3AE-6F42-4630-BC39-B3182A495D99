How do city leaders respond to global challenges and contribute to global governance? How are they influenced by city- to-city networking? How does city leadership translate into strategic responses to global challenges? Urban Gateways is designed to improve our understanding of how city leadership translates into long-term strategic visions, how it relates and contributes to global governance and how this global action is perceived ?on the ground? in cities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Urban Gateways will provide a global overview of the city leadership and strategic plans in both developing and developed countries, highlighting leadership approaches, strategic trends, foresight drivers and major hindrances in the development of strategic urban plans addressing global challenges. The project focuses both on major global cities and second-tier cities to offer not only international comparative assessments but also multi- tiered considerations that de-centre globalist models of international and urban research.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ACADEMIA
Urban Gateways is designed to shape the understanding of cities in international relations theory (IR) and international studies more broadly, as well as to promote a greater political awareness of the global challenges and processes that impact research on cities in urban studies. Urban Gateways will produce a number of outputs geared directly to allowing the participation of a wider audience in the discussion of global governance challenges as constitutive of the everyday experience of the urban dweller. 

Academic impact will be achieved through four main venues with the following targets:

1) peer-reviewed articles drawn from the fieldwork analysis of different cities and city networks. This output is designed to stimulate interest in the topic across a variety of IR and urban studies audiences reached through key journals in these fields; 
2) one early-career workshop in Oxford on the urbanization of global security. This initiative is designed to gather UK-based and international early career academics working on this theme, to promote collaborative research and future partnerships between urbanists and IR scholars;
3) a monograph following on the peer-reviewed articles and summarizing the main outcomes of the study for Oxford University Press, and an edited collection on cities and international security emerging from the related workshop. These output are targeted at the wider international relations and urban studies readership to systematize the appreciation of cities in world politics, while also allowing for a collaborative forum on the tangible impact of urbanization on IR;
4) a dedicated book series with the Palgrave Macmillan Pivot initiative on &amp;quot;global urban challenges&amp;quot; for international politics. This output is aimed at producing tangible and interdisciplinary outcomes, and benefiting both established and early career researchers with a wide-reach venue where to publish internationally-relevant city research.

POLICY
By engaging city officers in the fieldwork and workshop components of the study, Urban Gateways also seeks to foster academic research that is directly relevant to urban and international policymakers. The project is designed as a dialogue with selected local authorities from its early stages and is characterized by a series of ground-truth events across the development of the research. Policy impact will not only be achieved via the dissemination of publications, but also by the organization of a capacity-building workshop with early career scholars and municipal officers in the first year of the grant and mayoral forum at the conclusion of the project. 

Policy impact will be achieved through two main venues with the following targets:

1) future city leaders workshop, gathering six municipal officers from key cities investigated in the project and six early-career scholars specializing in key areas for Urban Gateways. This output is designed for direct impact on how the next generation of urban officers and international scholars view global challenges like climate change or social polarization, but also on how municipal officers interact with the international and urban studies academia.
2) mayoral forum convening up to four mayors interviewed during fieldwork and an equal number of key academics in international and urban studies. This output is designed not only to foster connections amongst leading municipal officers and scholars at the top of their expertise, but also to influence the internationalization of key cities such as London while receiving both substantial scholarly attention as well as international media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-23</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>243544</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Nations (UN)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Safer, smarter and sustainable Cities</gtr:description><gtr:id>C0CA7E4F-639D-4823-A1DC-3A617FAF9B37</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration resulted in the &amp;quot;Safer, Smarter and Sustainable Cities&amp;quot; report for the GNSC steering committee at the UN. The project involves a study aimed at identifying trends and commonalities in a selected pool of major international cities drawn from major city networks, key strategic orientations, inter-city connections, and gaps for further capacity building. In particular, the report focuses on highlighting touch points, development opportunities and conflicts/barriers between the &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;safer&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sustainable&amp;quot; city agendas that are now commonly discussed in the Habitat III process and applied in cities the world over.

&amp;quot;Powering Climate Action&amp;quot; analysed data from 66 cities in the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (C40). Within this data, it identifies typical power profiles that cities hold across 10 sectors, including transport, energy supply and water. We also observed a series of governance typologies that describe cities' approaches to climate governance. The report illustrates contrasting power profiles and governance models in cities from across the globe, but also commonalities that highlight great potential for knowledge sharing between cities. The research indicates that cities are in a strong position to catalyse climate action, particularly in cases where they collaborate with other actors.

&amp;quot;Climate Action in Megacities 3 (CAM 3.0) compiles and analyses data provided by 66 C40 cities in 2015, combined with previous data collected from cities in 2011 and 2013. The full database now includes nearly 10,000 climate actions taken by C40 cities during the past 5 years. Representing the largest and most long-term record of city climate action globally, CAM 3.0:
 
1) analyses climate action trends since 2011
2) highlights the critical role of networking and collaboration in cultivating city climate action
3) synthesises new data collected in 2015 on the costs of city climate action and the ways in which this action is being funded
4) provides an evidence base to encourage more investment in city climate action from the private sector and other investors 
5) investigates the direct benefits of city climate action, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions reductions
6) highlights cities' acknowledgement of increasing climate change risks, and their commitment to adaptation as well as mitigation

&amp;quot;Climate Action in Megacities 3.0&amp;quot; shows that cities are showing tremendous commitment to tackling climate change. However, there is an enormous number of actions that are not yet being taken which could make an even greater impact on emissions reduction and climate resilience.

The third report in the partnership, &amp;quot;Potential for Climate Action&amp;quot;, presents evidence of cities' potential for future climate action and establishes a framework to characterise the challenges that cities face. The report shows that political, regulatory and funding challenges are dominant across cities, and illustrates the role of collaboration, communication and coordination in overcoming complex challenges. Key features of the report are:

1) Analyses the most important specific actions that major cities can take to cut carbon emissions, and identifies the challenges that need to be overcome if mayors are to achieve them.
2) Identifies 2,300 priority actions which, if fully implemented, could cut GHG emissions by 50MtCO2e in the next few years.
3) Illustrates that city leaders need to partner with other actors to overcome the challenges that surround these potential actions - especially national/ regional governments, and private companies.
4) Calls for collaboration across sectors to identify the solutions that can be introduced to help cities accelerate and expand climate action.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The UCL research team provided high-level input (project framing, key messages, dissemination via events and talks), as well as day-to-day management of a dedicated team of research assistants (5 in total) and a consultant, hired at UCL to work specifically on the project.

The Future of City Leadership in the United Kingdom aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the UK, building on the Initiative's existing international work (via the &amp;quot;Urban Connections&amp;quot; project) to engage local governments across the whole country, both at the major metropolitan and the secondary level, to better understand the state of the art of city leadership in a context of major national and international socio-economic changes. The research will identify trends and commonalities in modes of city leadership in major cities, key strategic orientations and gaps for further inter-city connections.
