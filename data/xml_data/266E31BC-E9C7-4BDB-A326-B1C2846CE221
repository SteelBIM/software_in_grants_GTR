This study builds on recent research suggesting that celebrity informs young people?s educational and career aspirations in complex ways. It is exploring how accounts of aspiration within celebrity shape young people?s imagined futures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research questions are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What discourses (powerful and conflicting social stories) of aspiration circulate in celebrity representations?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do young people take-up these discourses in talking about their own aspirations?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do discourses of aspiration in celebrity and young people?s take-up of these relate to social class and gender?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This youth-centred study combines individual and group interviews with online forums and celebrity case studies and involves 144 young people in six English comprehensive schools. At the start of the school year, 24 participants per school, half in Year 10 (aged 14-15) and half in Year 12 (aged 16-17), will take part in group interviews. At the end of the school year 48 selected participants will take part in individual interviews. Between school visits, participants will be invited to join an online forum and there will be case studies of 12 celebrities who feature strongly in the group interviews.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit a range of non-academic communities. We have identified CAREERS EDUCATION, INFORMATION, ADVICE AND GUIDANCE (CEIAG) PRACTITIONERS as our primary user group. The study will provide careers educators and careers advisors working with young people in schools and colleges with knowledge of the role of celebrity in shaping young people's aspirations, in turn enabling them to engage with celebrity productively within their practice. To ensure a long term impact we will produce a glossy, colour 28-page Toolkit based on the research findings, with recommendations and practical ideas and activities. We will send two copies to all English Local Authorities (to be reviewed in light of the transformation of CEIAG services) and make it available online.

Our secondary user group are POLICYMAKERS in the Department for Education (DfE), Department for Work and Pensions and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills concerned with young people's educational and career aspirations and participation, and the relationship to wider inequalities. These are persistent concerns within educational policy (see Case for Support). This study will provide original evidence of how class and gender shape young people's educational and career aspirations through its unique and timely focus on the role of celebrity within this. To ensure long term impact on government, and think-tanks and policy networks with similar concerns, we will produce two policy-oriented Research Briefings (Interim and Final). Additionally the research could inform the work of government policymakers working on decisions following the latest review of the sexualisation and commercialisation of children. We will proactively intervene in evolving policy debates by writing to news outlets when relevant stories break.

In the long term, YOUNG PEOPLE will benefit from improved, evidence-informed careers advice and education, and from policies on educational and work aspirations that better take into account their needs, desires and social positioning.

The research will also be relevant to MEDIA EDUCATORS and YOUTH MEDIA COMISSIONERS. Media educators include teachers delivering media education and consumer literacy education in secondary schools, within Citizenship, PSHE, Media Studies, Sociology and English as well as practitioners working for cultural organisations with educational remits (e.g. the British Film Institute) and charities (e.g. Media Trust). They will benefit from understandings of how young people engage with celebrity that they can use in their work to help young people make sense of and make informed judgements about celebrity culture. Youth media commissioners in broadcasters who have education remits (e.g. Channel 4 and the BBC) will benefit from knowledge about how young people use their outputs and how they can enhance the educational aspects of these. We will seek long term impact on their work through publications of our findings in bespoke articles for key online and offline practitioner and media outlets.

Further details of our impact strategy are given in the Pathways to Impact.

We have built user engagement into every stage of the project, including gaining feedback on the proposal from members of key groups. In addition to the long term impacts above, we will seek immediate impact on the work of individuals who engage directly with the project through:
- Regular advisory group meetings with seven representatives from user groups.
- An interim practitioner workshop.
- A final communication event for invited stakeholders.
- Bespoke presentation of findings to participating schools.
- An accessible project website with regular updates, publicised via key networks and complemented by a social networking strategy.

We will keep the website live beyond the life of the project, including accessible versions of findings and implications for policy and practice (e.g. the CEIAG Toolkit and Research Briefings, see above).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-17</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>169818</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>End of Award Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9046B399-DBC7-430E-BE5C-601F15EC99CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Research Team held an End of Award Event on 10th-11th July.

The findings from the project have impacted the following groups in the following ways. 
1. Youth work practitioners have used the findings to inform their practice. This includes using ideas and resources produced by the research team in work with young people e.g. http://www.celebyouth.org/tania-de-st-croix/
2. Careers educators have used the findings to inform their discussions with young people e.g. http://www.celebyouth.org/claire-nix/
3. Media education teachers have used the findings in their teaching and the research has impacted directly on students via Laura Harvey's talk to the Media Magazine Conference e.g. http://www.celebyouth.org/pete-fraser/
4. Sociology teachers have used the findings in their teaching on topics on youth, education and research methods e.g. http://www.celebyouth.org/molly-rose/
5. PSHE teachers have used the findings to explore aspirations with young people e.g.http://www.celebyouth.org/they-want-to-be-famous-but-know-it-isnt-the-easy-route/
6. Third sector youth practitioners have used the work to inform their practice e.g. Character Scotland and A New Direction have both approached CelebYouth to collaborate
7. General public have benefited from a more critical debate about young people's relationship to celebrity e.g. over 100 comments in response to Daily Mail article, follow up media coverage including in US, appearances on national radio and television, large response to our article in Open Democracy
8. Performance artist Bryony Kimmings' work on Credible Likeable Superstar Role Model was informed by our findings and her powerful interventions into celebrity culture have had widespread impact
9. Young people have benefited from this through enhanced practice by professionals and better public understanding of their identities and aspirations. Some young people also took part in theatre workshops in which they acted out data from the study.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>905DEEA9-122C-414F-8E83-B427AD2EBFA3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>CelebYouth is the first UK-based large-scale empirical study of young people's relationship to celebrity. By engaging directly with young people, the study's findings challenge the dominant public narrative that young people are obsessed with becoming famous and that celebrity produces low aspirations and desires to get-rich-quick. Instead, participants had a wide variety of aspirations, with few desiring celebrity status or excessive wealth; many hoped simply to find interesting work and support families.

Celebrity provides a shared collection of stories through which young people can talk about other things, as the bible or classical mythology did for some in the past. Thus, celebrity is part of how ideas and values circulate in society - including about success, work, happiness and inequality. The data show a strong investment in meritocratic notions that talent and hard work should be, and are, rewarded, so masking ongoing inequalities. The study's conceptualisation of celebrity as a symbolic resource for young people opens up new questions for celebrity studies and education. As such, the research has been heralded as having &amp;quot;huge importance&amp;quot; in a 'Celebrity Studies' editorial and was at the centre of a keynote symposium at the 2013 British Educational Research Association Conference.

The study's novel methodology combines textual media analysis with youth-centred empirical research. This challenges how textual and empirical work have traditionally been separated into distinct fields (education/youth studies vs media/celebrity studies). The twelve celebrity case studies, which were subject to textual analysis, developed directly from group interviews with young people and subsequently were used in individual interviews, enabling analysis of celebrity discourses across datasets.

Studying celebrity empirically from young people's accounts rather than textually from academics' interests generated new knowledge about celebrity consumption via social media. The data show that YouTubers are a growing genre of celebrity, and identify the significance of YouTube as a site of youth cultural labour and career aspiration. The incorporation of social media (Twitter/YouTube) into the celebrity case studies highlights the changing public spaces and actors through which celebrity is consumed and its meanings produced. These findings call for revisions to contemporary definitions of celebrity; and to methodologies for the study of celebrity.

The study was one of the first to significantly deploy online tools for the communication of academic research, being cited as an exemplar of digital sociology. It is at the forefront of international moves to make research 'live' through a website/blog that shares methodological reflections, emerging findings and communication activities. Linking the website/blog to a YouTube channel, lively Twitter and Facebook accounts, and guest blogs, helped build a global community of scholars interested in how people use celebrity in their everyday lives. It has also impacted on a range of users within teaching, careers education, media and youth work. The associated mythbusting site was developed with practitioners to make the findings accessible to users. It includes illustrated stories of young people from the study and videos of data brought to life by a youth theatre group. Both sites remain active and leave a legacy of resources.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The study's findings on celebrity as a symbolic resource, social media celebrification and combining empirical with textual data are being taken forward by scholars in education, sociology and media and celebrity studies. A 76- interview dataset has been archived to support future work. The website was accessed by 18,801 people during the study's final year, Twitter followed by 1295 people, Facebook by 150, and YouTube viewed 1967 times. These continue to be accessed by academic and non-academic users. Academic publications from the study are in process, alongside a funding application to extend the work into a longitudinal study.

Through the mythbusting website (www.celebyouth.org/mythbusting) and public events, the study is providing youth practitioners with knowledge of the role of celebrity in shaping youth aspirations, enabling them to productively engage with celebrity within their practice. As one wrote, &amp;quot;it hadn't really occurred to me that celebrity talk was a way of talking about hopes, dreams, fears, fairness, equality I've had so many great discussions with young people since starting to read your blog&amp;quot;. A 2015 &amp;pound;15k Brunel Knowledge Transfer Secondment will extend, package and promote the online resources for teachers, media educators, careers educators and youth workers to ensure maximum impact.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2899F272-58AC-4824-9C17-C663F9749449</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.celebyouth.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7A57C830-35EE-459D-BE9E-5D8E3300A4B7"><gtr:id>7A57C830-35EE-459D-BE9E-5D8E3300A4B7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tom Daley's Something I want to say. . . : examining contemporary celebrity, identity and sexuality</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Media Education Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7279bc532df65787e5ba62ad60e5b4a9"><gtr:id>7279bc532df65787e5ba62ad60e5b4a9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Allen, Kim</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FB7F7475-96CE-48E5-9C1F-2634B083B40D"><gtr:id>FB7F7475-96CE-48E5-9C1F-2634B083B40D</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;quot;Will Smith is the coolest person on earth&amp;quot;?
