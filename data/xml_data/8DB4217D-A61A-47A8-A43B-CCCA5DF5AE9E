&lt;p>The degree to which recent changes in gender relations and intimate life are symptomatic of increasing individualisation has been much debated among western sociologists. These debates, however have focused almost exclusively on western societies. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study brings the modern societies of East Asia, exemplified by Hong Kong, into the frame. It will take account of global trends (eg the increasing participation of women in the labour market, later marriage and low fertility) but also consider how local historical, socio-economic and cultural contexts affect the ways in which modern social change is experienced and understood. Both Asian and western sociological literature will be reviewed to inform a comparative qualitative study based on life-history interviews with pairs of mothers and daughters in both the UK and Hong Kong, investigating how they see the changes that have occurred in the lives of themselves and each other, in particular in relation to intimate and familial relationships. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75935</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This study aimed to explore women's experiences of recent social change in Hong Kong and Britain, as a small corrective to the predominantly western focus of academic debates on of the consequences of late modernity for personal life. We conducted life-history interviews with young educated women and their mothers - 13 young British women and 12 of their mothers and 14 Hong Kong young women and 12 of their mothers - plus focus groups with young women. Women's lives in these two equally modern societies in part reflected global trends, such as women's increasing labour market participation and more women delaying or eschewing marriage and motherhood, but with some marked divergences - attributable not only to cultural differences but also material circumstances such as Hong Kong's limited welfare provision and extreme housing pressures. The British mothers in our sample grew up in a welfare state in which free education was, for many of them, a means of social mobility. Some of the Hong Kong mothers had experienced extreme hardship in their childhoods and had often been expected to contribute financially from an early age - sometimes in small family businesses, which were one route out of poverty. In Hong Kong mutual support and regular contact among extended kin was common (and necessary given economic uncertainty and poor welfare provision) and daughters usually lived with their parents until they married. Young British women tended to live apart from their parents except in crises, e.g. loss of jobs or relationship breakdown. Wider family affiliations were looser in Britain and some of the young women grew up with parents who had never married or living between two households where parents had separated (both arrangements were unknown in Hong Kong - though being reared partly by grandparents was common). Sexual mores were more relaxed in Britain and mother expected their daughters to be sexually active while Hong Kong mothers sought to preserve their daughters' chastity (not always successfully). Hong Kong daughters had been experienced much stricter discipline in their childhoods than their British contemporaries. All the mothers encouraged daughters' educational and career aspirations, but Hong Kong mothers pushed them much harder. Hong Kong young women were more career-oriented and, unlike many of their British counterparts, did not envisage taking career breaks or working part-time when they had children. 

In terms of family relationships, British women valued disclosing and confiding while Hong Kong women put more emphasis on companionship and practical support (BSA presentation 2012). While family solidarity was stronger in Hong Kong, neither sample in either generation led individualised lives and all constructed highly relational self-narratives. Hong Kong women of both generations, while also valuing aspects of Chinese tradition, were more self-consciously constructing 'modern' selves than their British counterparts - perhaps a product of experiencing such rapid social change.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings, however, might also be of interest to policy makers and NGOs concerned with family matters This is a small exploratory study and has most relevance to other academics interested in debates on intimacy and modenrity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D70B1B9D-B6EF-4989-BF88-090BCAFB8362</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture/ Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F29D70C0-57D8-4FF6-AA47-A83A404D908B"><gtr:id>F29D70C0-57D8-4FF6-AA47-A83A404D908B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modernity/Modernities and Personal Life</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Korean Journal of Sociology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b07b0aa531af202c4ca09e845c03dc2d"><gtr:id>b07b0aa531af202c4ca09e845c03dc2d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jackson S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7184ACDF-ED1A-4473-B584-F7B77E6E97F1"><gtr:id>7184ACDF-ED1A-4473-B584-F7B77E6E97F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mother/daughter relationships: cultural differences and modernity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discover Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fe3b0e9e5e6af1fec3bca4d558aeb208"><gtr:id>fe3b0e9e5e6af1fec3bca4d558aeb208</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>jackson s</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2B5CA179-69EE-4F60-A7E0-6F4911234AAA"><gtr:id>2B5CA179-69EE-4F60-A7E0-6F4911234AAA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reshaping Tradition?
