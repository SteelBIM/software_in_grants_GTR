NIAB has members associated with high affiliation of arable and horticultural growers. Alzeim has a well co-ordinated network of growers and farm specialists within Wales with whom the Consortium will place contracts and ensure a scientifically- led development of the crop. Grower guides and demonstrations plots will be made available via specialist meetings and workshops, such as Members Days at NIAB and. choice of cultivars and production methods will be published as part of the NIAB publication set when the crop is at a suitable stage of development. Meetings and workshops will be held to demonstrate the potential of this crop to meet the requirements of farmers, processors and the food companies. These will include the NNFCC at York and other bodies. It is probable that upland growers will be the first to participate and benefit, but when the `Black Mountains Effect' is understood it is hoped that growing can be extended to other altitudes and areas. At Bangor, in addition to published academic output in stress biochemistry and physiology and hydroponics, Prof Tomos has decades of experience of communicating science to lay audiences - including regular talks (live, radio and TV) and regular articles in magazines (eg Barn, Agenda, Y Naturieithwr). These include meetings with Farmers Associations (inc FUW in 2009). Other engagement activities include serving on the Board of Governors of BBSRC-IGER and as a (non-exec) director of an upland grasiers association (set up to manage changing regulations governing the use of uplands). This (galanthamine) project is particularly suitable for public engagement of science. Dr. Braganca is a member of WINR (Welsh Institute of Natural Resources) which has considerable outreach activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>198345</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sustanum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>AGROGAL Consortium (BBSRC-LINK)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E82E470-70DE-49B0-B87A-93F7F964B6AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Determination of the impact of a range of individual physiological treatments on galanthamine accumulation by daffodils.
