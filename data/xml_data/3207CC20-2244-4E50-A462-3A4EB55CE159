Investigating Renaissance gossip and nonsense in both well-known and less famous works will provide a unique perspective onto the past, an insight into part of our cultural heritage which would otherwise remain hidden. It will also shed light on concerns of the present day as gossip and nonsense still play a part in everday life, ranging from the gossip columns of tabloids to incomprehensible official jargon. \n\nGossip and nonsense have a particular power in the historical context of Renaissance France because they mark the point where the contemporary style of linguistic excess, seen in abundant lists, fulsome praise, and overflowing rhetoric, seems to go too far, in terms of either morality or meaning or both. Indeed, the great Dutch humanist Erasmus, whose guidebooks on how to write copiously were enormously influential throughout Europe, was also one of the foremost theorists of the dangers of an unbridled tongue. \n\nNeither gossip nor nonsense has been much studied as far as French Renaissance literature is concerned, yet they demand sustained enquiry. Gossip has an important role to play in Renaissance stories, given its unusual capacity both to reinforce links between those sharing gossip and undermine social networks, by casting damaging aspersions on individuals. Indeed, gossip became a literary genre of the time, as male writers expressed their political views through works purporting to transcribe the gossip of women of all social classes. Nonsense can pose even more basic questions, as the chapters of nonsense penned by Rabelais call interpretation itself into question. Yet, like gossip, nonsense can serve political or moral purposes, mocking the kind of legal and medical writings and practices that sought to order the messiness of human experience. Hence our research will uncover the wide range of social, political and moral uses made of nonsense and gossip in French Renaissance literary texts. \n\nDr Hugh Roberts (University of Exeter) and Dr Emily Butterworth (King's College London), will manage the project which involves the following activities:\n\n1. 2 monographs, on nonsense and gossip respectively.\n2. A PhD studentship, for a thesis on comic sexual euphemism in French Renaissance literature.\n3. A symposium and workshop for a team of international specialists with a view to producing a special issue of a refereed journal.\n4. 2 peer-reviewed articles co-authored by Butterworth and Roberts.\n5. Collaboration with 2 artists, Dominic Hills and Clare Qualmann, who will produce in interaction with the researchers a blog documenting the creative process, and artwork, to include, for example, iPhone applications which give animated versions of Renaissance stories (Hills), and a performance as well as flyers/posters (Qualmann).\n6. A website presenting the project, incorporating the project blog and a database of obscenities as an example of excessive Renaissance language.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our pathways to impact involve the following 3 projects:\n\n1. The London-based artist Clare Qualmann - see http://www.clarequalmann.co.uk/ - creating text- and sound-based artwork about gossip and the proliferation of language in public places.\n2. The Exeter-based artist Dominic Hills - see http://www.edgarmodern.com/Artist-Detail.cfm?ArtistsID=175 - reinterpreting Rabelaisian linguistic excess, probably in the form of interactive applications for mobile devices (e.g. iPhones).\n3. The database of Renaissance obscenities, currently 'live' on the website of the AHRC-funded research network on the notion of obscenity in the Renaissance - http://groups.exeter.ac.uk/obscenity/search/about.php - to be incorporated into the proposed project's website.\n\nI. Who will benefit from this research?\n\nOur pathways to impact are designed to benefit members of the wider public in the UK, and in the French-speaking world, through research-related performance artworks focusing on gossip, interactive art for mobile devices focusing on nonsense, and the database of French Renaissance obscenities to be incorporated into the project's website. Through their online presence (blogs, website, downloads) the impact proposals have the potential to reach a very wide geographical audience while simultaneously engaging community and tourist audiences in London for the proposed performance art. \n\nOur pathways to impact may also benefit the commercial private sector, for example through sales of fine art, perhaps in the form of iPhone applications, or in some other commercial form, while the material collected in the database of obscenities could form the basis of a commercial publication in France beyond the lifetime of the grant. Galleries may also benefit from the artwork; indeed, the award of the 2010 Turner Prize to Susan Philipsz for a sound installation indicates the timeliness of our proposals for innovative art, including a sound-based performance piece.\n\n2. How will they benefit from this research?\n\nThe impact projects will be of social and cultural benefit to the wider public. Our research themes are of continuing relevance and interest, which is precisely why they have excited the attention of contemporary artists. In terms of the artwork, a project blog will document the research and creative process, making this available to the wider public as the work is ongoing. Through performance and through other publicly-available art in London, Clare Qualmann's artwork on gossip will aim to engage the public very directly in reflection on their own (and other people's) everyday practices of talk and exposure to language. Dominic Hills's proposed art for mobile devices will seek to harness the playfulness of Renaissance nonsense and excessive language in a new and interactive form of fine art. The database of obscenities will offer an insight into the 'underbelly' of French culture, a glimpse of part of our cultural heritage that normally remains obscure, and will highlight the distinction - or lack of one - between 'high' and 'low' culture. All 3 projects thus engage the public with their own and others' culture, foster intercultural and historical awareness, and encourage reflection on various forms of excessive language which will in turn enrich daily life.\n\nWe also aim to reach the wider public through the media, via press releases from our institutions and from the AHRC, through direct communication with the arts press (e.g. Art Monthly) and through work with the University of Exeter's Research and Knowledge Transfer Office. The project website and the project's blog will also provide a platform for publicity and the dissemination of the work. This publicity may in turn lead to the interest of commercial beneficiaries of our research.\n\nWe shall deliver our 3 main impact projects within the 3 years of this project while further commerc</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195602</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Since the beginning of the grant, Clare Qulamann has been producing text artworks based on live games of Chinese Whispers or (as here) the transformation of a sentence as it is passed through an online translation programme.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC3A1BB5-49D0-4C4E-93EC-28E11B53818E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration between Clare Qualmann and Emily Butterworth as part of this grant has led to participation in the London art festival, Inside/Out.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Chinese Whispers: Online Translations</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/2013/08/chinese-whispers-using-online-translation-services/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>My collaborator Clare Qualmann and I led a performance entitled Renaissance Rumour and Chinese Whispers at the 2014 Inside/Out Festival in London.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B1BC9EC-38AF-4172-AF9B-9D80127DBC9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Audience reported change in thinking on the spread of rumour.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Renaissance Rumour and Chinese Whispers</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.insideoutfestival.org.uk/2014/events/renaissance-rumours-and-chinese-whispers/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We held a closing exhibition at The Cass, London Metropolitan University, Central House, 59-63 Whitechapel High Street, London E1 7PF, 11-12 December 2015, involving a display of Dominic Hills's prints and multiple games of Chinese Whispers of Sol LeWitt's sentences on conceptual art and simultaneous letterpress printing of the nonsensical results by Clare Qualmann and a presentation of the project by Emily Butterworth, Clare Qualmann and Hugh Roberts.

3. The database of Renaissance obscenities, currently 'live' on the website of the AHRC-funded research network on the notion of obscenity in the Renaissance - http://groups.exeter.ac.uk/obscenity/search/about.php - to be incorporated into the proposed project's website. 

We have pursued these pathways and created more during the project's three-year duration. We have documented our activities on the project blog: http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/ 

Natalie Steed produced a podcast: http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/podcast/ including interviews with researchers, artists, and recording of French Renaissance gossip songs, at our workshop at King's College London, 9-10 July 2014. A final exhibition of artwork from the project, at the Cass, London Metropolitan University, Whitechapel, London, 11-12 December 2015, also involved all key researchers and artists: http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/2016/02/final-exhibition/ We give more detail of the collaborations involved below.

Clare Qualmann
Clare has been working with Emily Butterworth on an art project inspired by Emily's work on gossip and rumour. Clare is an artist whose practice includes both performance and text-based work, and for the Gossip and Nonsense project she has created pieces that use the parlour game Chinese Whispers to explore the movement of information through networks and the ease with which it descends into nonsense. Clare has played games of Chinese Whispers with academics at both the project's colloquia (June 2013 and June 2014); hosted a performance-piece for the general public as part of the Inside/Out Festival in 2014; and performed more games with her colleagues in the Walking Artists Network. Some of these ephemeral performances have been documented by BBC radio producer Natalie Steed, and featured on the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Something Understood: Gossip and Whispers' in December 2014 (see below for more details). Clare then printed the resulting whispered sentences using Letterpress to produce a limited run of text-based artworks. She has also experimented with online translation services, feeding texts back and forth through various websites, and has produced artwork of the results.

Clare's outputs include:
1. Performances of Chinese Whispers at the two project colloquia (involving 15 academics), June 2013 and June 2014
http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/2013/10/chinese-whispers-gossip-and-nonsense/ 
2. 'Renaissance Rumour and Chinese Whispers', performance at the Inside/Out Festival, October 2014 (involving 20 members of the general public)

Other pathways to impact

Online magazine publication
To publicise the Inside/Out Festival event in October 2013, Emily was asked to write a piece for The Lady Online, entitled 'Tweets and Whispers' (published 15 October 2014).

Radio broadcast
In December 2014, Emily was interviewed for the BBC Radio 4 programme 'Something Understood' for an episode entitled 'Gossip and Whispers'. The programme featured Emily's work with Clare on the spread of gossip and rumour using Chinese Whispers, and it included recordings of the Inside/Out performance and the sixteenth-century French gossip songs performed at the London colloquium in June 2014.

King's College London Arts and Humanities Festival
In October 2015, Emily organised and took part in a talk on pre-modern gossip and song, featuring sixteenth-century gossip songs. The event was attended by 30 members of the university and the general public, and a recording is available to watch through the Festival website:

Charivari!
In December 2015, Emily was involved in an impact project organised through the Arts and Humanities Research Institute at King's College London that explored the pre-modern shaming ritual, charivari. It involved students of the KCL Music Department who researched and presented the material, and two newly commissioned contemporary responses to the charivari, written and directed by two Music students. The event was attended by 30 members of the university and the general public, and it involved 20 undergraduate students.

Dominic Hills
Exeter-based fine artist Dominic Hills has been working with Hugh Roberts since the start of the grant. His main production has been a series of over twenty prints inspired by playful and erotic Japanese woodcuts known as shunga. The prints are inventive responses to comic, obscene, or nonsensical expressions from the French Renaissance, drawn from Hugh's research in this area. We have documented our exchange in frequent blog posts http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/ 

Economic impact of the collaboration to date includes five prints Hills has sold through Robert Eagle Fine Art, London, retail value &amp;pound;500 each, &amp;pound;2500 total. 

Hills and the computer programmer Bobby Gilbert were awarded further funding of &amp;pound;7500 of REACT-HEIF (Higher Education Innovation Fund linked to AHRC-REACT and administered by the University of Exeter's Research and Knowledge Transfer), to develop a prototype digital version of Dominic Hill's 3D, pop-up or otherwise interactive prints. Work on the digital version, possibly to become a fine art digital book, is on-going. The blog contains examples of animated prints including a three-dimensional print of a nonsense love poem: http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/2013/06/illustrating-and-animating-renaissance-nonsense/

Hills's prints have also been fly-posted in London, Berlin, Basel and Savannah (Georgia, USA), partly to play with the nature of excessive language and partly in homage to his influences, including the Japanese prints (which were not always considered high art) and French student protest art from May 1968. See http://gossipandnonsense.exeter.ac.uk/gallery/He has also exhibited them at project meetings and at the final exhibition for the project in London in December 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D5D18EF4-BCBA-4B22-82B4-F4A6ABDD58F2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Gossip and Nonsense fell naturally into two complementary strands. We discuss the links between the two in our introduction to 'Gossip and Nonsense: Excessive Language in Renaissance France and England', the special issue of 'Renaissance Studies', 30 (2016) devoted to the project, which is available through open access throughout 2016: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rest.2016.30.issue-1/issuetoc

The strand on gossip, directed by Emily Butterworth, focused on literary representations of idle and excessive talk in the long sixteenth century, and investigated the impact of the French Wars of Religion on perceptions of gossip and rumour, placing them in the context of an emerging public sphere of political critique and discussion. Emily's book, The Unbridled Tongue: Babble and Gossip in Renaissance France (published by Oxford University Press in 2016), is about talking too much and why it was considered not just inadvisable but dangerous in sixteenth-century Europe. Despite denigrating idle talk, early modern orthodoxy was fascinated by what it could reveal: other people's secrets or the hidden truth about the self. Babble and gossip seem crucial to early modern conceptions of the self and self-governance. Influenced by great moralists of the tongue and its dangers like Erasmus and Plutarch, early modern writers thought of talking too much like a disease, a disease that could overwhelm and swamp an individual's subjectivity in an endless, automatic flow of words, that the subject had no more control over than other bodily effluvia (early modern discussions of the babbling tongue are often very visceral, and link verbal incontinence with other forms). The research for this strand identifies a number of rhetorical figures that recur in discussions of the loose tongue and provide telling perspectives. One of these is the figure of the 'public voice', often mobilised in the period as a voice of contestation and protest, and an unruly participant in the emerging public sphere of political debate and critique. Another is the rhetorical figure of parrhesia, or free speech, which appears ambivalent in many early modern accounts. Claimed particularly by early modern Protestants as a duty and a virtue, it represented for them the bold telling of truth to power, but could easily be re-described as coarse provocation.

Research into babble and gossip also uncovered surprising details about public and private life and the relationship between them. This was particularly visible in the case of the word priv&amp;eacute;, which in sixteenth-century French doesn't quite mean 'private', as it does now, but rather contained meanings of secrecy and intimacy that may well have invited investigation and suspicion. One of the main arguments in The Unbridled Tongue is that early modern discussions of gossip, intimacy, what can be said on the street and what should be kept in the bedroom, helped to construct our current concept of the public and the private.

What is surprising about early modern discussions of gossip, rumour, and related forms of excessive speech is how political they seem. Gossip and rumour were political tools, used and manipulated by various parties, especially in the pamphlet skirmishes of the French Wars of Religion (1562-1594). The book argues that sixteenth-century moralists did a lot of work to denigrate gossip by associating it with women, despite their fears about the political implications of male gossip. This association had two consequences. The first was to denigrate women's speech as frivolous and inconsequential; the second was to exclude gossip and informal speech from the polite public sphere through its proximity to the feminine and the frivolous. These consequences are still visible today, despite gossip's clear political power.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The special issue of 'Renaissance Studies' devoted to the project gives perfect examples of how our research themes and questions have given rise to new research in music, history, and English as well as French studies. The gossip project joins a newly established field in early modern studies, that of excessive and deviant speech - the 'sins of the tongue' of medieval pastoral literature. There is more work to be done in this area. As well as subject areas, we hope that our methodology in this project will have an impact on future academic research. The sustained focus on the vocabulary of the period to investigate a 'concept', and the close collaborative work involved in writing and editing the collective volume, both provide productive working models for future research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB869CB3-A37E-44D1-A279-AB0F64798EB2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rest.2016.30.issue-1/issuetoc</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4D9C8014-79F5-466B-A54F-26CFDAC9B94A"><gtr:id>4D9C8014-79F5-466B-A54F-26CFDAC9B94A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gossip and the Public Sphere in Les Caquets de l'accouchee (1622)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Forum for Modern Language Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e"><gtr:id>96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Butterworth E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D49923F-4C33-4767-B943-123DD07D1537"><gtr:id>7D49923F-4C33-4767-B943-123DD07D1537</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mauvaises Langues!</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e"><gtr:id>96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Butterworth E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-2-87775-567-2</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1D40FC0E-DAFD-4259-AF5E-3C60BD6C7B12"><gtr:id>1D40FC0E-DAFD-4259-AF5E-3C60BD6C7B12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gossip and nonsense in Renaissance France and England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e"><gtr:id>96cc5eaf6d8fbc36ea0a26bb74a1701e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Butterworth E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/52704B12-1DFF-4363-B2CB-9E51E3D7E26B"><gtr:id>52704B12-1DFF-4363-B2CB-9E51E3D7E26B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hubbub and satire</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9de016d2e42f9761359e21dab12d2dc4"><gtr:id>9de016d2e42f9761359e21dab12d2dc4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brady A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3FB8BCC3-679D-4342-92A1-3CABFDF5EA69"><gtr:id>3FB8BCC3-679D-4342-92A1-3CABFDF5EA69</gtr:id><gtr:title>Twelfth Nightand the philology of nonsense</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3305e939cd6d08de013cbffe7e8014a8"><gtr:id>3305e939cd6d08de013cbffe7e8014a8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zucker A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A73BD08C-13B9-4B77-9A10-E5167CF949BD"><gtr:id>A73BD08C-13B9-4B77-9A10-E5167CF949BD</gtr:id><gtr:title>When writers gossip: authorial reputation in the literary polemics of the French 1620s*</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4f3ff3b0b65cd9bed9505b4f0ef0ecb2"><gtr:id>4f3ff3b0b65cd9bed9505b4f0ef0ecb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bombart M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4CFDDEEE-39BE-4FE7-9B16-544088D5D5AB"><gtr:id>4CFDDEEE-39BE-4FE7-9B16-544088D5D5AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>'When the tongue slips it tells the truth': tricks and truths of the Renaissance lapsus*</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Renaissance Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b4f371d543b66a692d31697dcac555de"><gtr:id>b4f371d543b66a692d31697dcac555de</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Brancher D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B0723BF9-4B83-447E-ABA3-2D5C934CBEB6"><gtr:id>B0723BF9-4B83-447E-ABA3-2D5C934CBEB6</gtr:id><gtr:title>&amp;lt;&amp;lt;
