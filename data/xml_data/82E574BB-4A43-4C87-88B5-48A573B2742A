These agents resemble particles composing inert matter but a striking difference is that they produce their own motion. They are generically referred to as active particles.
 
Like herds and flocks, most active particle systems exhibit self-organized collective motion. The mechanisms by which self-organization emerges are still poorly understood. Current research on this question is intense. In this work, we view the emergence of self-organization as a bifurcation from a non-coordinated state of the system to a collectively coordinated one. Bifurcations are intimately related to what physicists call phase transitions, i. e. abrupt changes of the state of a system when its environmental parameters are changed. Everyday examples are changes of state of matter such as water changing from liquid to vapor when its temperature crosses the boiling temperature. In nature, animals groups may change from a random motion state (when they are foraging for food for instance) to a coordinated motion state (when they want to escape the attack of a predator) in a similar way. 

Our goal is to study mathematical models for active particle systems. We aim to develop macroscopic descriptions of these systems when the number of particles is large and to analyse their bifurcation from disordered to collective motion. Indeed, when the number of agents is large, it is neither possible nor efficient to follow each agent individually. Macroscopic models describe the evolution of statistical averages such as the mean density or velocity of the particles and are computationally much more efficient. Their rigorous derivation involves complex mathematical tools of kinetic theory but they give rise to an efficient way of analysing bifurcations. 

Like for matter, there are many different types of bifurcations in active particle systems. In this proposal, we will focus on two specific but important examples. The first one is symmetry-breaking bifurcations when a system state changes its underlying symmetry. The second one is bifurcation due to jamming, which occurs when finite sized particles reach the density where they are all in contact with each other as in dense crowds for instance. To test the general character of our findings, we will also investigate other kinds of bifurcations, by looking at systems of rigid bodies interacting through attitude coordination, having collective sperm-cell dynamics as an application in mind. 

The nature of mathematical models varies according to which state of the system they are adapted to. When several states are present simultaneously, they are separated by abrupt transition interfaces. To numerically approximate such situations, numerical methods that are uniformly accurate across the transition interface will be developed. They will allow us to validate the models by comparing them with real data in two selected applications, namely collective sperm-cell dynamics and pedestrian dynamics. In these two examples, we will showcase the usefulness of the models by using them to anticipate the outcome of various strategies of action aiming to change the collective behaviour of the system.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on society: Active particle systems are ubiquitous in biology and social sciences. Many animals live in large coordinated societies. Understanding collective behaviour is important for managing biological resources. Tissues and cells are composed of many individual entities which constantly coordinate to fulfill the needs of the organism. It is of key importance for medicine to understand this coordination as its disruption results in diseases such as cancer. In economics or social dynamics, similar collective phenomena occur and better understanding them would help in preventing financial or social crises. One focus of this project concerns collective sperm-cell dynamics which is a tracer of semen fertility. Collective dynamics triggers turbulent motion of the semen and is easily observed under the microscope. Automatized objective measurements of this turbulence are needed in artificial insemination centers to improve the quality of the selected semen samples. A patent application has already been filed (of which the PI holds 40 \% of the invention shares). Future developments in the area of human fertility are envisioned. A second focus is about pedestrian dynamics. In densely populated areas, pedestrian safety represents a major challenge. Efficiency issues are equally important in places like walkways or underground corridors. To forecast future occupation of walkways in real-time so as to guide people towards less crowded routes, the use of efficient models, such as macroscopic models is necessary. The models developed in the present project will greatly contribute to the advancement of our knowledge in these two selected applications. 

Exploitation: Collective dynamics can be used as a probe of the proper functioning of a system, like in the above example, where collective sperm-cell dynamics is used as a tracer of semen fertility. To the largest possible extent, other patents will be sought in the application areas targeted by this proposal. In particular, the PI is currently envisioning a system for crowd forecasting. As often as possible, the PI will look for ways to transfer the basic knowledge acquired in the project into practical innovations. The existence of a dedicated structure at Imperial will greatly facilitate this process. In addition, each faculty has a Knowledge Transfer Fellow and Intellectual Property is protected through Imperial Innovations Ltd.

Human resources: Young researchers hired on this project will be offered a stimulating environment, with a unique opportunity to work at the leading edge of research in applied mathematics and modeling. They will be encouraged to develop an autonomous thinking and research methodology and to follow their own threads of research. They will receive full support to attend the largest international conferences in the field and to present their own work. They will also be encouraged to visit other teams with the objective of building their own network of collaborations. On general aspects of staff development and support, they will find an extensive programme offered by Imperial College. By the combination of all these factors, young researchers will acquire a greater scientific maturity which will considerably improve their future hiring prospects. The PI has a long track-record of post-doc advising. Most of his former post-docs have found positions in academia, research related institutions or industry. People with a strong experience in mathematical and numerical modeling are highly demanded in UK and in Europe. So, it is expected that the young researchers hired on the project will subsequently be in a pole position in the market of highly skilled jobs, be they in academia or in industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>381010</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Case Western Reserve University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Mathematics</gtr:department><gtr:description>Phase Transitions in a kinetic flocking model of Cucker-Smale type</gtr:description><gtr:id>B2A7C53A-9235-4734-9257-43B362BB1009</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article has appeared; A.

1. Emergence of symmetry breaking phase transitions in concentrated semen: Semen confined in an annular channel exhibit spontaneous collective rotation. We have shown that this is linked to a transition from disordered sperm cell motion at low concentration (when the sperm is dilute) to collective motion at high concentration (when the sperm is undiluted). Indeed, self-propulsion of the sperm-cells combines with the effect of confinment in the annular chamber to force all sperm-cell to move in the same direction, leading to the spontaneous collective rotation of the sperm-cells around the inner radius of the annulus. We expect that the measurement of the rotation speed will provide an easy way to select the most active sperm. In a related publication we have shown that this activity level is correlated to a higher fertility. Hence, we can use this apparatus as a fertility diagnostic of semen samples in animal artificial reproduction industry. 

2. We have found new models for systems of self-propelled particles interacting through full body attitude coordination i.e. agents that do not only try to align their velocity to their neighbors but align the full attitude of their bodies modelled as rotation matrices. These models feature new mathematical objects such as spatio-temporally dependent rotation matrix or unitary quaternion fields, the properties of which are almost unexplored so far.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings 1 (symmetry-breaking phase transitions in concentrated semen) could be used by the animal artificial insemination industry to improve the fertility diagnostics of semen samples. 

Findings 2 (self-propelled particles interacting through full body attitude coordination) These models could have applications for instance, in the understanding of bird flocks of schools of fish and could be usefully reproduced for the control of fleets of drones or submarines. It could also be useful to understand collective sperm dynamics as sperm cells have complex shapes (they look like tennis rackets) which could have significant influence on their dynamics.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1DC89F6F-BB5D-423A-BEDA-7B026C24CC9E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/degond/Home/scientific-interests</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This model enables us to study the self-organization of tissue as the result of the interaction between collagen fibers and cells.
