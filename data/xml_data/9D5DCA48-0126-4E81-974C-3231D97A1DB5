2015-20</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M001660/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Funding is requested for the continuation of the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS), from 2015-2020, as the ESRC resource centre responsible for three British birth cohort studies. The 1958 National Child Development Study (NCDS), the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70) and the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) are major national, indeed international, data resources and form a core part of the UK's portfolio of longitudinal studies. 

This proposal builds on the existing strengths of CLS as an efficient site for cohort maintenance, data preparation and documentation, user support and engagement, training, capacity building and methodological advice. There is a strong scientific rationale for continuing to gather data from these cohorts. Each new survey enhances the value of the existing study and allows for further analyses examining how experiences and circumstances in early life may impact on later outcomes. 

Data collection: We aim to collect data from each cohort between 2015 and 2020: BCS70 at age 46 and 50, NCDS at age 60 and MCS at age 17. NCDS and BCS70 now have about 10,000 adult subjects each, and are coordinated to collect very similar information, allowing cross-cohort comparisons. In 2012, there was a 60-minute, face-to-face interview survey of BCS70 members at age 42 and, in 2013, a sweep of the NCDS cohort at age 55 that involved a web survey followed by telephone interviews for those not responding. MCS followed children at roughly two-yearly intervals up to the fourth survey at age 7 in 2008. This study, starting out with nearly 19,000 babies, has most recently collected data on approximately 13,000 children at age 11. A major survey of MCS members in 2014-15 is under development, and is projected to reach 12,000 individuals (this survey has been covered by a previous funding application). 

Tracking cohorts: Keeping in touch with members of the three cohorts over time is key to maximising response rates. CLS maintains address databases for each study, and we have recently extended our use of administrative data for tracking cohort members by using NHS records on BCS70 (at age 42) and MCS (age 11) and the National Pupil Database on MCS (age 11). As this was highly successful we plan to use administrative data for tracking all three cohorts in future. We will also continue to improve the websites we have established for members of each cohort.

Dissemination and Exploiting data: We have a carefully considered strategy for ensuring that data from the cohort studies are fully exploited by a wide range of users. Consultation conferences will be held, and working groups established, to ensure that the data collected are relevant to policymakers and other potential users. Workshops and conferences will be organised to publicise the datasets, provide training in their use, and to share the results of analyses. The CLS website, offering data documentation, and a searchable bibliography, will continue to be important for sharing information about the studies. We will develop and redesign the site, guided by careful monitoring of its use via Google Analytics. Media coverage of the cohort studies has proven to be an effective way of reaching many of CLS's target audiences, including policymakers, practitioners and the general public. CLS will continue to issue press releases on new publications and findings, and will make increasing use of social media. We also plan 'new data campaigns' for the MCS age 14 and 17 surveys, the NCDS age 60 survey, and the BCS70 age 46 survey, to raise awareness of newly available data. 

Impact: CLS recognises the importance of monitoring, recording and publicising the impact of its studies and has detailed plans for widening the scope of this activity during the new funding period. We will, for example, produce a series of case studies analysing the effect of our work on policy and practice and will establish a special section on the CLS website in order to showcase this impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this resource?
Data users
As CLS's core objective is to produce high-quality data resources, the primary beneficiaries of its work are data users. CLS is very conscious that data users exist across sectors, career stages, disciplines and countries. We will continue to increase the size, skills and diversity of this group. This will necessarily include targeting potential new users in the public and third sectors, doctoral students, and academics. In particular, CLS will build stronger relationships with Doctoral Training Centres and early career researchers.
Policymakers - Findings from the cohort studies have direct relevance to a range of policy issues. In 2010-15, CLS successfully raised awareness of cohort study findings among policymakers, primarily through its media and events work. Focusing on central government and devolved administrations - but also local government - CLS will continue to improve the accessibility of both the data and findings for these beneficiaries.
Wider research community
CLS holds considerable substantive, methodological and professional expertise. By contributing to relevant networks, events and publications, CLS will aim to share its knowledge even more widely with those involved in social and economic research in the UK and abroad. CLS will build on its current participation in networks and organisations such as the Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies, the European Survey Research Association, the British Educational Research Association, and others.
Practitioners
Findings from the cohort studies are useful to practitioners, their regulators, and their professional associations. CLS will continue to focus on practitioners whose specialisms have the closest links to the life domains covered by the cohort studies, including teachers and lecturers, childcare providers, pensions advisors, and health and social care practitioners.
Public service providers - Closely tied to practitioners are public service providers such as the NHS, schools, colleges, universities, social landlords, and local councils. Findings from the studies can provide background and context for service provision, particularly in justifying and evaluating services, but also to help shape certain practices (for example, encouraging health-related behaviours such as breastfeeding).
General public
As a publicly-funded resource centre, CLS has a duty to make its work transparent and accessible to the general public. However, CLS also has the potential to improve public understanding of social, economic and health issues. Findings from the studies often speak directly to issues in everyday life, such as parenting, general physical and mental health, preparing for retirement. It should also be noted that the general public includes cohort members and their families. Public outreach, such as press coverage of the studies, will contribute to boosting cohort members' engagement (see section 6 of Case for support for more information on cohort member communications).
Media
CLS has often reached its target audiences through successful engagement with international, national, regional and local press. More information on our media work can be found in the Pathways to Impact section.

How will they benefit from this resource?
CLS outputs and services will benefit the groups listed above in several ways:
-high-quality, well-documented data resources for research
-training and capacity building support for those analysing data, including students and early career researchers
-relevant and timely packaging of findings for policy development and practice guidance, for example, blogs, briefing documents and events, and social media
-easier access to published works using cohort data, for example through the CLS online bibliography
-accessible and engaging information on social, economic and health issues, for example through web news items, press releases, social media, and briefing papers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>18451665</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A novel computer game commissioned (and subsequently developed by Duck Duck Zeus), which explores findings from studies housed at the Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS). In particular, research on social inequalities: a reoccurring finding from these studies is that socioeconomic circumstances at birth are strongly related to events later in life. For example, those born into less favourable circumstances (in terms of lower income/wealth, education, or social class) are less likely (on average) to obtain higher education and more likely to experience health problems as adults. These findings have powerful repercussions for society, yet can be difficult to grasp. This game incorporates some of these findings into its gameplay. By playing the game and understanding how it is made the game aimed to help players to become more familiar with these relationships and gain a greater understanding of the potential of the longitudinal studies that underpin them.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CC90515C-0E8E-4030-ABF2-15B8D110403B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As of 16th March 2017, the game had been downloaded and played by 6,204 individuals across a wide regional distribution.

This event has the aim of disseminating research to a non-academic audience, such as the children, parents, schoolteachers and the like. We are going to discuss some of the research relating to reading for pleasure, and how to promote it within the home. Prof Alice Sullivan and Dr Sam Parsons presented findings from MCS and BCS70 on the importance of reading to child development and adult outcomes to parents and teachers, while Pamela Butchart and William Grill (both children's authors) carried out workshops with the pupils.

It is a large conference lasting 5 days with multiple strands parallel sessions at each time, attended by around 800 academics, professional survey practitioners and post-graduate students from around the world. 

This is one of the major international survey methodology conferences, which takes place biennially. It was attended by eight members of CLS staff. In total, we delivered and/or co-authored eleven presentations based on the three of our four cohort studies, covering surveying children and young people, collection of time-use and activity monitor data, data linkage, mixed-modes, event history calendars, para-data, DDI and interviewer training. Many of the presentations were joint with the survey agencies we have worked with on the studies (NatCen, IPSOS-MORI and TNS-BMRB). We are also organised seven conference sessions in total on surveying children and young people, collecting time-use data and administrative data linkage. 

Our presence at ESRA was backed up by a London-based social media strategy which involved tweets from the @clscohorts account to promote the presentations on the cohort studies and the sessions we organised. Two of the staff members also engaged in tweeting at the conference. It total we sent around 150 tweets making us among the top tweeters at the whole conference.

The report present the opportunity to the voluntary sector of baby boomers reaching retirement age. As this generation enters retirement, there is an oppotunity for the voluntary sector to recruit new volunteers. Representatives included Age UK, NCVO, Barnardos, and Jewish Care. It was organised by NBFA Assisting the Elderly, and hosted by Mercer.

I provided a keynote talk on the lives of the 1958 cohort as they approached retirement. The purpose of the talk was to stimulate thinking and discussion, and to provide background information on what this generation's lives are like. It covered the 1958 cohort's partnership history, employment history, health, caring responsibilities, social participation and wellbeing. The talk was incredibly well received and sparked discussion for the rest of the day.

Following my talk, participants engaging in practical discussion of how they might realise the potential of baby boomers as volunteers, but also provide flexible opporunitites to fit the lifestyles and competing time demands of this generation. 

Following the event, I was invited to give the same talk to Jewish Care to stimulate their thinking for their team away day. I have also been approached by NBFA Assisting the Elderly to pursue a joint project looking at the age 50 qualitative interviews in the National Child Development Study.

Selection bias, in the form of incomplete or missing data, is unavoidable in longitudinal surveys. It results in smaller samples, incomplete histories, lower statistical power and it is well known that unbiased estimates cannot be obtained without properly addressing the implications of incompleteness. However, statistical methods exist which enable users to exploit the full richness of longitudinal data and address sources of bias. We present the first results from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies Missing Data Strategy using data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) which follows the lives of 17,416 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958. Also known as the 1958 Birth Cohort Study, it collects information on physical and educational development, economic circumstances, employment, family life, health behaviour, wellbeing, social participation and attitudes. Since the birth survey in 1958, there have been ten further 'sweeps' of all cohort members at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 44, 46, 50 and 55. Within Rubin's framework we present three papers where we clarify the situations where complete case analysis and methods that operate under the Missing At Random assumption return unbiased results. We present a three step empirical/data driven approach that maximises the plausibility of the Missing At Random assumption in NCDS and quantify the effect of strong departures from MAR. Our findings have implications for missing data handling in the 1958 cohort and other longitudinal studies as they will help inform the selection of auxiliary variables and allow researchers to effectively communicate the assumptions underlying popular MAR methods such as Multiple Imputation, Full Information Maximum Likelihood and Inverse Probability Weighting.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.closer.ac.uk/event/longitudinal-methodology-series-ix-centre-longitudinal-studies/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Christine O'Farrelly to give advice on collecting saliva samples</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>783C2964-A89C-4EC2-9F01-F1179B1EA524</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with Christine O'Farrelly (Healthy Start, Happy Start - Trial Manager, Imperial College London) plus two of her colleagues to give advice on collecting saliva samples from children, based on our experiences of doing this on Millennium Cohort Study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release: LGB bullying</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BD52B2AA-58D1-4C55-A1EC-D0C7AB78AE2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Bullying does not stop in the playground for lesbian, gay and bisexual young people, study finds

In this research project we explore the feasibility of conducting a longitudinal survey, which would capture the full picture of the growing-up process possibly from birth to the end of a child/young person's education. As part of this they are undertaking a review of key national and international longitudinal surveys in order to:
? Understand key design decisions (population coverage, sample design, questionnaire development and testing methods used, etc.)
? Learn lessons from the above about what worked well and what worked less well (particularly regarding participation) to support recommendations that will be made to the European Commission.

The work asked professionals within universities and Widening Participation personnel to consider admissions practice and the way subjects may act as a signal to admission staff. The abstract follows: 

In the first half of this seminar Dr. Morag Henderson will look at Subject Choices at 14. Does the school curriculum generate educational inequalities? This paper reports on initial findings from a major ESRC project on social mobility. We identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. This topic is particularly important for England as the school curriculum encourages specialisation at a relatively early age compared with other European countries. This curriculum differentiation is typically framed in terms of 'choice', but in practice young people's choices are constrained by their schools. In addition, adolescents are likely to lack the information needed to foresee the long-term consequences of options taken as young as age 14. Yet most past research on 'subject choice' has focused on the 
later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. The choices made at early branching points can limit pupils' subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. 

We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining these curriculum clusters. We also examine the role of the intersections of these variables, for example, the different role of gender for working and middle class 
youth. Using measures of prior attainment at 7 and eleven, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually exacerbate inequalities.

It includes a computer-based training session that gives participants the opportunity to analyse the data under the guidance of experienced users.

The workshop was fully booked with 25 delegates. They scored it an average of 8/10 on both satisfaction and relevance. 

Some comments included:

The STATA coding was excellent.

An excellent course that gave me a better understanding of how I could use MCS in the future.

Everything was very useufl as I am new to the MCS data. Workshop was a great idea. Many things are much clearer now and I feel more confident in trying to work with these data.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/Conference.aspx?itemid=3258&amp;itemTitle=Training+workshop%3a+Introduction+to+the+Millennium+Cohort+Study&amp;sitesectionid=28&amp;sitesectiontitle=Events&amp;returnlink=Conference.aspx%3fsitesectionid%3d28%26sitesectiontitle%3dEvents%26from%3d0</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BAMBERG Sibling analysis family structure</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>867EB236-D957-4D61-87CF-9994A8CBFB7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented to SLLS conference has sinced been written up and submitted to an international journal</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Improving UK evidence on health and environmental (low carbon) behaviours: a one-day workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9AF3B691-29C5-4737-BF4B-F92474FD9313</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There is potential for a combined approach to tackling climate change and improving public health.Against this background, the workshop aims were to assess data sources on environmental (particularly low-carbon behaviours) and health behaviours in order to enhance the UK research data infrastructure.

They are considering four outcome domains: health; behaviour; cognitive outcomes; and social and peer outcomes. 
The measures to be used for each of the outcomes for each of these domains are:
? Health: overweight/ obesity / BMI (measured at all sweeps from age 3 to age 11)
? Behaviour: Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and its subscales (measured at all sweeps from age 3 to age 11)
? Cognitive and educational outcomes: the various cognitive assessments implemented at the different sweeps, from age 3 to age 11; plus linked National Pupil Database (NPD) Key Stage 2 (KS2) scores at age 11. 
? Social and peer outcomes: bullying (as reported by child at ages 7 and 11); peer problems subscale from the SDQ (as reported by parent at all sweeps from age 3 to age 11).

This is an intensive piece of work and I am seeking your support to join an Advisory Group to help to oversee the development of this work and to monitor progress. 
The commitment involved:
? Review the draft literature review between 14 and 17 March 2016.
? Participate in an Advisory Group meeting 17 March 2016 to sign off literature review. Time to be arranged
? Review PREview scoping report + analytical plan 4 between 4 April and 7 April 2016
? Participate in Advisory Group meeting 7 April 2016 for presentation of analytical PREview scoping report + sign off of analytical plan. Time to be arranged
? Review draft report between 27 April and 6 May 2016

This would be considered a non-controversial response. The intuitive assumption when considering subjective wellbeing and psychological distress is that factors associated with one are associated with the other - albeit in the opposite direction. But what if we're wrong? What if wellbeing and mental illness, or happy and sad, are not two sides of the same mental health coin?

In this blog for World Mental Health Day, Dr Praveetha Patalay examines the factors that influence children's mental illness and wellbeing using the Millennium Cohort Study.

Some comments from delegates include:

I really enjoyed the breakout sessions, and it was great to hear what other participants' priorities were, as it gave me insight to their work &amp;amp; how others use the MCS.

[I enjoyed the] opportunity to contribute input into the age 17 sweep in the context of the constraints of funding and respondent burden. Also an opportunity for me to learn from others about the different cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes/ measurement tools. And of course to meet colleagues and for networking.

This event was part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science, and was hosted by Barclays at their creative space in east London. It was hosted by CLS in collaboration with the Anti-Bullying Alliance.

Speakers included Dr Stella Chatzitheochari, University of Warwick (presented research on bullying among children with disabilities); Dr Morag Henderson, CLS (presented research on bullying among sexual minorities); Prof Louise Arseneault, King's College London (presented on the long-term effects of childhood bullying on adult physical and mental health); Kiri Joliffe, Young NCB representative (presented a first-hand account of her experiences being bullied at school); Anna Feuchtwang, Anti-Bullying Alliance (chair).

There were just under 140 delegates in attendance: 42 members of the third sector, 28 members of the public sector, 38 academics, 21 members of the general public, and 9 others.

Following the presentations from academics, the panel (including a young person and members of the Anti-Bullying Alliance team), engaged in a discussion with the audience.

Delegates gave this event an average of 8/10 on satisfaction, and a 8.5/10 on relevance.

Following the event, a PGCE Programme Leader from the UCL Institute of Education requested more information on the research to inform teacher training on equality and diversity.

CLS also had requests for further information from Buckinghamshire County Council, The Theatre Centre (empowering young leadership and youth activism through the arts), and members of the public.


Following the event, the Founder and President of Red Balloon Learner Centres asked to collaborate on future bullying work.

Following the event, a delegate from Buckinghamshire County Council requested 100 copies of all event materials to distribute to delegates at the Council's upcoming E-Safety Conference for students and professionals working with children and young people.

My name is Clare Ward and I'm the Chief Executive of Superu (Social Policy Evaluation and Research Unit) in New Zealand. 
Superu is an autonomous Crown entity that has been set up by the New Zealand government to increase the use of evidence in social sector decision-making (policy, funding, and delivery) to improve outcomes for families and children. The NZ Government has a particular focus on taking an investment approach, investing early for measurably improved longer-term results. This approach requires all parties to use evidence and Superu is one of a number of initiatives that the Government has put in place to help achieve this.
Part of their role relates to influencing the development of sustainable research assets to support good social science research. In this role they manage the contract for the longitudinal Growing Up in New Zealand Study which is delivered by Auckland University. A particular focus for us is increasing the use of this data in policy-relevant research.
We advised Clare on how we are working to encourage the use of the data to inform policy-making as well as how we work with ESRC.

The 20th century witnessed significant improvements in health in most countries including substantial increases in survival to older ages and large reductions in late age mortality. The continuing rise in life expectancy is undoubtedly one of the great successes of public health, but has also raised the question of how healthily the gained years of life will be spent. We use data from UK's birth cohorts, other longitudinal studies and repeated cross sectional surveys to investigate competing theories of the joint progress of health and mortality. Sullivan's method and regression based approaches were employed exploiting their different underlying assumptions to empirically test the compression, expansion and dynamic equilibrium of morbidity hypotheses. We found evidence for expansion of morbidity in the working age population, whereas a more complex pattern emerged in the older population, indicating a structural break between generations. The opportunities and challenges of employing longitudinal and life course studies to empirically test competing theories of ageing and practical implications for the study of potential mechanisms that underlie the joint progress of health and mortality will be discussed.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Katherine Woolf regarding setting-up a new cohort study</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DE3B3F31-29EC-4255-9330-1C49DA5C8E36</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One hour meeting with Dr Katherine Woolf (Senior Lecturer in Medical Education, Deputy Lead for Research UCL Medical School) to give advice regarding setting-up a new cohort study</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release: Able pupils from poorer homes 'less likely to be judged above average'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F48DC435-1C22-4D7D-A5B7-784B756D74C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Able pupils from poorer homes 'less likely to be judged above average', new research suggests

The prevention of non-response in longitudinal surveys: an overview of the literature and some ideas for future research

This presentation is about the prevention of unit non-response in longitudinal surveys through improving survey practice. I will give a brief overview of the relevant theoretical and empirical literature on non-response in longitudinal surveys covering all of the main sources of non-response i.e. location, contact and co-operation and focusing primarily on evidence from major face-to-face longitudinal surveys in the UK. Recent developments such as the use of para-data, adaptive or response designs and targeted response inducement strategies will be discussed. I will highlight some gaps in our knowledge and suggest some ideas for future research and practice.

The impact of attrition and non-response in birth cohort studies: a need to incorporate missingness strategies

This paper reveals the need to incorporate strategies to handle missing data by revealing the extent of attrition in the 1970 British Birth Cohort Study (BCS70) and how it affects sample composition over time. To begin with we illustrate the construction of inverse probability weights (IPWs) to adjust for the unit non-response. Secondly, we illustrate the impact of using IPWs and multiple imputation (MI) for an artificially constructed set of patterns of missingness for a substantive research question. Our findings show that when the predictive power of the response models is weak, the efficacy of using IPWs is undermined. Further, MI is effective in reducing the bias resulting from item missingness when the magnitude of the bias is high and the imputation models are well specified.

We recorded the two presenations and they are available on the project website.

Missing data handling in longitudinal studies: Evidence for the 1958 British birth cohort.

Selection bias, in the form of incomplete or missing data, is unavoidable in longitudinal surveys. It results in smaller samples, incomplete histories, lower statistical power and it is well known that unbiased estimates cannot be obtained without properly addressing the implications of incompleteness. However, statistical methods exist which enable users to exploit the full richness of longitudinal data and address sources of bias. We present the first results from the Centre for Longitudinal Studies Missing Data Strategy using data from the National Child Development Study (NCDS) which follows the lives of 17,416 people born in England, Scotland and Wales in a single week of 1958. Also known as the 1958 Birth Cohort Study, it collects information on physical and educational development, economic circumstances, employment, family life, health behaviour, wellbeing, social participation and attitudes. Since the birth survey in 1958, there have been ten further 'sweeps' of all cohort members at ages 7, 11, 16, 23, 33, 42, 44, 46, 50 and 55. Within Rubin's framework we present three papers where we clarify the situations where complete case analysis and methods that operate under the Missing At Random assumption return unbiased results. We present a three step empirical/data driven approach that maximises the plausibility of the Missing At Random assumption in NCDS and quantify the effect of strong departures from MAR. Our findings have implications for missing data handling in the 1958 cohort and other longitudinal studies as they will help inform the selection of auxiliary variables and allow researchers to effectively communicate the assumptions underlying popular MAR methods such as Multiple Imputation, Full Information Maximum Likelihood and Inverse Probability Weighting.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release: Psychological distress on the rise for younger generations as men feel the strain in middle age</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13AB1356-82F4-4CBD-BA47-436DFADE2D0C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Generation X suffers poorer mental health in mid-life than the Baby Boomers before them, according to new research from the UCL Institute of Education (IOE).

There was considerable discussion afterwards and from this we started to form a research group on the topic of Subject Choice bringing together international researchers who are working in this field. 

The abstract follows: 

In this paper we identify patterns of subject and qualification choices made at age 14. Most past research on 'subject choice' has focused on the later stages of educational trajectories, particularly Higher Education. However, the choices made at early branching points can limit pupils' subsequent options, potentially contributing to educational inequalities. This paper identifies the patterns of General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) subjects chosen by a cohort of young people born in 1989/1990. We make use of the Next Steps data (formerly the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE)) which is linked to the National Pupil Database. We develop an approach to measuring the academic selectivity of subjects and qualifications. We examine the roles of social class, parental education, income, gender and ethnicity in determining participation in these curriculum groupings. We also examine the role of the intersections of these variables, for example, the different role of gender for working and middle class youth. Using measures of prior attainment measured at age thirteen, we address the question of whether curriculum differentials simply reflect differences in prior attainment or whether they actually exacerbate inequalities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.slls.org.uk/#!call-for-papers/c11p2</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;
