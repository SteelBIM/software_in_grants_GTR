Finding and implementing these solutions is a top priority for governments and scientists worldwide, and has been articulated as a key BBSRC strategic objective. Opportunities for plant science to contribute to global food security include increasing the yield and quality of crops, combatting diseases, enabling maximal crop productivity in sub-optimal growth conditions, and increasing maximal yield potential. Utilising non- food components of food crops, such as cell wall material and waste products of food production to produce energy and industrial feedstocks, has a major role in reaching sustainability and maximising overall yield of renewable resources from limited land and soils. Grass crops are essential for human existence by directly or indirectly serving as the primary source of human nutrition. Wheat, rice and coarse grains such as maize are the most important crops for human food production, therefore increasing grain production sustainably is a critically important strategic and scientific objective. Wheat is the main arable crop in the UK, planted on 60% of arable land, with an annual farm gate value of ~&amp;pound;2.5b and a processed product value of approximately &amp;pound;150bn. Yield increases in wheat are slowing compared to past gains achieved primarily through improved agronomy and also in relation to other grain crops, notably maize. Genetic and transgenic improvement of wheat is therefore a very high priority in the UK and world- wide, and large international programmes for wheat genetic improvement are underway. A high quality genomics sequence provides a complete, accurate and durable record of genes, predicted proteins and other genomic elements that today are a fundamental foundation for neay all areas of biological research. This proposal describes a UK component of an international coordinated wheat genome sequencing project that will make decisive and innovative contributions to sequencing the wheat genome and supporting crop improvement through genomics.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Bread wheat has an exceptionally complex genome comprised of three independently- maintained genomes, each of which is approximately 6 Gb- more that the entire human genome. Wheat genes are found predominantly as small (1-4) clusters, with an average density of between 1 gene/86kb in proximal regions and 1gene/180 kb in distal regions of the chromosome. Genes and gene islands are separated by extensive tracts of nested retrotransposon repeats comprising approximately 85% of the genome. The gene content of diploid grasses is approximately 30-35,000 suggesting bread wheat has approximately three times this number of genes. The scale and complexity of this genome requires a large coordinated effort and the development and application of new technologies. Work in the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium aims to generate accurate sequences of nearly all genes, annotate these and place them in a syntenic framework. Four chromosomes will be sequenced to high quality reference standards using a combination of established methods and novel sequencing technologies. Re-sequencing methods will be developed to access sequence variation in the Triticeae in concert with the pre-breeding programme. Finally, bioinformatics resources for the long- term maintenance and analysis of the sequence will be established.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The transformative effect of access to high quality genome sequence that is carefully analyzed, and directly and freely available to all users, is well known. Wheat is one of the three major crop plants of global importance, and the predicted impact of a high quality wheat genome resource on crop improvement will be profound, as genomics provides a framework for new breeding methods that are substantially faster and more effective. The wheat genome project will have two immediate impacts on a wide range of new research in wheat by researchers world-wide, and on the application of genomics to breeding and crop improvement by the breeding and agricultural biotechnology industries. Thus plant and crop scientists working in academia and industry are direct beneficiaries of the outcomes of the project. The impact of a genome sequence to these researchers will be profound. Access to and systematic study of all proteins sequence variation in the Triticeae, global gene expression, and the systems-level analysis of biological functions will transform research in crop improvement. Because many agronomic traits in wheat, such as yield and abiotic stress responses, are due to the effects of many genes, such traits will now be accessible to the full range of experimentation possible in modern biology. Consequently progress towards increasing yield stability and sustainable production will be substantially accelerated. The agricultural biotechnology and crop breeding industries, and bioinformatics and computer scientists working on genome assembly and analysis, will benefit from a similar revolutionary effect of genomics seen in rice and maize breeding. A key impact will be the direct and permanent improvements in the rate and scope of wheat breeding, leading to the production of new wheat varieties that can maintain high levels of productivity with reduced inputs. Research funding organizations are also direct beneficiaries of this project by enabling transformative research in wheat improvement, particularly through international collaborations. The impact is a major tangible contribution to meeting important societal goals in food security and sustainable production world-wide. Many indirect beneficiaries of the research can be predicted. Wheat growers will benefit from new varieties that will be more productive and with new end-uses, leading to more stable incomes and diversified production. By addressing the environmental sustainability of crop production through new genomics- lead research in nutrient- and water- use efficiency, the major environmental footprint of wheat production could be reduced, having a beneficial impact on the ecology and sustainability of the agricultural landscape. Other indirect beneficiaries are food processors, who will have access to affordable and a more secure supply of a global staple product. In turn consumers will benefit from more stable prices and access to a staple food.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2667351</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International wheat congress (Frankfurt)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4FEB441D-4F59-4DE9-A786-81C290AD7D7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference presentation organized by German Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (BLE)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wheatinitiative.org/events/international-wheat-congress</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TGAC web and social media figures relating to the wheat genome release</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D40F5335-41CD-4F17-A909-03FDA494BA77</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.tgac.ac.uk/news/241/15/The-Genome-Analysis-Centre-announces-an-important-milestone-in-wheat-research/

This assembly is ~40% more complete, and 40 times longer sequences than previous assemblies. This data is publicly available on the TGAC and ENSEMBL websites, to BLAST search, browse gene models and to download. To this assembly we writing an new scaffolder to integrating additional data types e.g. longer range mate pairs (~20kb), fosmid libraries in vectors that are compatible with Illumina sequencing of fosmid ends (FosIlls) for scaffolding in the 40kb range. A manuscript has been submitted to BioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/10/13/080796) describing this work, and this has just been accepted by the journal Genome Research for publication in May 2017 (Clavijo, Venturini et al. 2017). To this Chinese Spring reference assembly we have now added another 4 hexaploid and one tetraploid assemblies whihc are publicly available http://opendata.earlham.ac.uk/Triticum_aestivum/EI/v1/ 

For objective 2 we have annotated genes within the genome using new data generated as part of this project which includes full length transcripts sequences using PacBio long read technology and strand specific Illumina compatible RNA-seq libraries with long (250bp on Illumina) reads. See Clavijo, Venturini et al. 2017

For objective 3 we released our genome assembly assigning scaffolds to chromosome arms using flow sorted data we published in 2014. We have now integrated PopSeq genetic markers, whihc allows us to identify known and novel translocations see Clavijo, Venturini et al. 2017

For objective 4 as discussed in the mid term review, we have developed a high throughput, low cost BAC sequencing pipeline to prepare and sequence the samples in a rapid, cost-effective manner. We have parallelised processes to sequence at first 384 samples (BACs) at once then increased this 6-fold to processing 2304 samples at once, and most recently 9,216 samples. We have also decreased the cost and increased the throughput to the extent that it is possible to sequence the whole bread wheat genome using randomly generated BACs at low cost. This would achieve further cost savings as creating an MTP is time consuming and costly. We have integrated of these random BACs with those of the already sequenced 3DL MTP - a useful test case for the whole genome. We have also used these BACs for quality control of our TGACv1 assembly (Clavijo, Venturini et al. 2017) and supplied them to the IWGSC.

For objective 5 we have tested Moleculo synthetic long range data, 10x Gneomics, plus in vitro (Dovetail) and in vivo Hi-C data for longer range scaffolding especially in areas of poor recombination.

For objective 6 the re-sequencing of genes of mutagenised populations, and genes of diverse Triticeae genomes relevant to wheat pre-breeding research, we have developed an automated exome resequencing pipeline starting with leaf tissue and progressing to identify millions of EMS induced SNPs. This pipeline is useful for wheat and numerous other crops. 
This is now published in Krasileva et al. PNAS 2017

For objective 7 to maximize the impact of the research through training and outreach we provided annual training workshop in using the wheat genomic resources for breeders, and were excited to hear about the breeders work as well as their positive feedback on our progress and to hear what data or tools they would like us to prioritise to serve the community.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Developing new genotyping platforms, identify tightly linked markers and clone genes underlying key traits.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AC342A80-F010-432C-B29B-9420D3BC2788</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.wheatgenome.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK Future Wheat meeting</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6D828755-CC98-41B8-BAAE-9B2AC979113E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Formulating a plan for future wheat research in the UK including effective collaboration between experts in JIC, Rothamsted, TGAC, NIAB, Universities of Bristol and Nottingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Genomic Selection meeting at CGIAR</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78CA8A3F-91C6-4AA3-A51F-C5E6CF85A5FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an international meeting at CGIAR headquarters covering multiple aspects of the advatages and challenges of genomic selection (GS).

A document is currently being drafted for Nature Genetics on the findings form this meeting e.g.

&amp;quot;Genomic selection directly addresses three of the four factors that affect the rate of genetic gain in animal and plant breeding (Meuwissen 2003): (i) time - through the ability to select individuals before obtaining their phenotypes, some of which can only be measured after the animal can reproduce or plant reaches maturity; (ii) selection intensity - as the cost of genotyping an individual or line is lower than the cost of phenotyping more candidates for selection can be handled; (iii) and accuracy - because genetic estimates of breeding value (GEBV) can, in some circumstances, be more accurate than conventional estimated breeding values. Additionally, genomic selection can catalyze a unification of breeding methods, tools, and technologies across several plant and animal species, which in turn can provide a push toward the modernization of other aspects of breeding programs. These could include the widespread adoption of clearly defined breeding goals, economic selection indices, objective quantification of genetic gains, and new trial design and analysis.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Wheat pan-genomics</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D053324D-8AEB-477E-AD66-60D5D3347A86</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We described the EI technological advances and our plans to use these for improved wheat breeding with interested parties from developed and developing countries to improve their wheat breeding programs by sequencing key accessions from their countries. This has lead to the establishment of a large multi-national collaboration with substantial cross links and obvious synergies. The worry prior to this meeting was that there would be disparate efforts using different technological approaches which would prevent comparison, meta-analysis and lead to a split in wheat genetics/genomics - this has been avoided and we expect great progress to be made in short time frames.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This resource consists of TILLING populations developed in tetraploid durum wheat cv 'Kronos' and hexaploid bread wheat cv 'Cadenza' as part of a joint project between the University of California Davis, Rothamsted Research, The Earlham Institute, and John Innes Centre.

There is a need to improve crops to feed the world's growing population with the backdrop of climate change. Translation of fundamental plant biology research (e.g. from Arabidopsis thaliana) into crops such as wheat provides a potential route to deal with this challenge. However learning even simple tasks such as growing and crossing wheat plants requires time and effort, while material and methods sections in published articles are often short and cannot substitute teaching aids. This is also true for more complex topics such as the genomics aspect of wheat.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3F41CF9C-6929-49B8-8096-A259C7DCC058</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2000
