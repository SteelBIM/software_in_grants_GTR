series exploring socially just education and inequalities in education</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M001873/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This seminar series seeks to explore the idea of a socially just education system and how such a system might address inequalities in society. The seminars and mini-conferences will explore alternative and innovative examples and ideas from schools and universities across a range of countries and consider whether these alternatives may reduce social and educational inequality. Do they offer an insight into how to improve education for all?
Political, organisational and cultural pressures make it challenging for people to consider alternatives to the mainstream. We want to be able to reflect on our own educational assumptions, practices, and systems so as to be open to possibilities of doing things differently. In order to challenge ourselves as much as possible, it is important that we invite contributors who are able to focus our attention on radical alternatives in education. We will therefore invite researchers and practitioners who focus on innovative and new ways of operating. These examples are not being showcased as ideal models to emulate but as a means of envisioning alternatives to the systems that dominate in society. By doing this, we want to start thinking in ways that have 'yet to be thought', to transform education for the future.
This seminar series will bring together a range of eminent international researchers and practitioners to share their work and to enable the development of new networks of researchers and practitioners working in different fields. Through the face to face meetings and the use of our interactive site, teachers, parents and academic researchers from Denmark, India, Mexico, Australia and the USA, for example, can share their experiences of working in innovative schools, colleges, universities and community settings. Researchers from leading international universities will talk about their decades of work studying the impact of different educational practices on inequalities. Students who have had the freedom to take a lead in designing their own education will explain what they have learnt from being able to do this. Postgraduate students will talk about their research into educational alternatives. Universities and schools will learn together. Teachers and students will listen to one another. Researchers and practitioners will work together. Through collaborating with all of these people, we will ask searching questions about whether organising education in radically different ways, actually makes a positive difference to the lived experiences of students.
The practice of freedom will be a particular focus of the seminars and this freedom can take many forms: freedom in terms of curriculum and pedagogy; freedom in assessment; freedom to make decisions. To mirror this, we will make sure that all events operate in a spirit of freedom, so that all participants can get involved in setting the direction and focus of sessions.
The seminar series will be organised as seven open events. Each will have a specific focus which will draw attention to a different facet of socially just education and inequalities (Outlining the challenge; Pedagogy and Curriculum; Assessment; Freedom, Autonomy and Democracy; Systems, Structures and Governance; Education of the Future, The Ways Forward). Each will be organised to be of interest to a wide audience and to encourage communication and the building of professional and academic networks. 
Each seminar will be free to attend and they will take place in a variety of venues across the UK, including Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, London, Newcastle, and Oxford.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of the research will grow as our knowledge of this new field develops. 
Academics: The seminar series benefits academics across a range of disciplines (for example, Education, Sociology, Youth and Community Work, Geography, Philosophy, Social Policy). Of particular significance is the development of new connections between international fields of research in socially just education, social inequalities and counter-hegemonic educational practices. The series will link academic contexts with independent organisations through the work of the selected project team. 
Practitioners in examples of socially just and counter-hegemonic educational organisations: These organisations are, by their definition, unusual within their social, political and educational contexts and practitioners may often feel isolated. The seminar series provides the opportunity for these practitioners to form networks, either in person at the mini-conferences, or virtually through the web-based provision. There are key opportunities for these practitioners to reflect on their practice and in particular, on its role in relation to addressing inequalities.
Practitioners in more traditional educational organisations: Although practitioners in traditional educational organisations may be given time to reflect, it is likely that the space for them to choose what to reflect upon is limited (Au, 2008). In particular, the performativity discourse which is dominant, particularly in the UK and USA, places constraints on innovation and creativity and limits thinking (Bernstein, 1996). The seminar series, with its emphasis on studying examples of autonomous, alternative or counter-hegemonic systems, provides opportunities for all practitioners to reflect upon their own environments and what might be learnt from these alternatives.
Trade Unions: Teaching Unions which represent schools (for example, NUT, NASUWT, ASCL, NAHT), further education (ATL), universities (UCU) and the community sector (UNISON) will be included in the detailed planning and organisation this seminar series. Through attending, participating and sharing their perspectives, they will offer and gain valuable insights into this field.
Policy makers: The seminar series has a clear and overarching connection with policy in that it is underpinned by a critique of the structures, processes and cultures of conventional educational organisations which, as researchers have shown, have done little to reduce inequalities and much to exacerbate them (Reay, 2012). By studying educational alternatives and their potential impact upon inequalities, especially those in an international arena, policy-makers have the opportunity to reflect upon and reconsider their assumptions about educational practice. Connections will be made with policy institutes such as the IPPR (Institute for Public Policy Research), PSI (Policy Studies Institute), NEF (New Economics Foundation), as well as campaigning bodies including Compass (Together for a Good Society), CASE (Council for Advancement and Support of Education whose commissioning editor and a founder member of CASE will be invited to the seminars), Phoenix Education Trust and EUDEC (European Democratic Education Community). They will be invited to the seminars and publicity material will be created for them as part of the portfolio of publications. 
Parents and students: There will be opportunities for parents and students to be involved with the planning of the events and the sharing their experiences of being part of alternative and counter-hegemonic organisations. The format for this will be carefully negotiated so as to ensure that these groups serve to personally benefit from attending these events, rather than to simply 'use' them in a tokenistic manner. The use of World Cafe Forums and Open Space Technology are ideal ways of ensuring that discussions are open and equitable.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>25829</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Mexico, United Mexican States</gtr:country><gtr:description>UK-Mexico research collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>DF875D7F-3977-4596-9D68-21ABF760321F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

Strong relationships have been built between UK and Mexican academics. Since the formal workshop (in Feb 2015), Professor Fernandez Cardenas has visited the UK for an additional research visit, during which he presented his work on dialogue and transformation at the University of Hull and the University of Cambridge. He is currently collaborating with Prof Montgomery on two new research projects. Another colleague from Tecnol&amp;oacute;gico de Monterrey (Dr Sandra Gudino) will be visiting Hull in May 2016 to further develop collaborations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Prof Catherine Montgomery (University of Hull) led a British Council Researcher Links Project with Professor Juan Manuel Fernandez Cardenas (Tecnol&amp;oacute;gico de Monterrey) which focused on the development of dialogue and transformative learning in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) education with particular reference to basic education and English. The aim of the workshop was to bring together early career researchers and experienced researchers from Mexico and the UK to develop research capacity in the field of dialogue and transformative learning in order to improve the overall quality of education and achievement of school age children. In addition to Prof Montgomery, Dr Max Hope (University of Hull) and Dr Will Curtis (University of Warwick), both key members of the project team for the ESRC seminar series, attended the workshop in Mexico. Strong collaborations were built with academics in Mexico.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 5: Freedom, Autonomy and Democracy in Education (Hull)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F17F3CC8-238A-413B-9DC0-40425FCC34BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the fifth of the seminar series and took place in Hull on Wednesday 9 March 2016, 12-5pm (University of Hull). This was an open event which had been widely advertised through our website, posters, emails, Facebook and Twitter. The aim of the event was to bring together practitioners, parents, teachers, students, academics, policy-makers and educational campaigners. Participants included some who had attended previous events, but many new people, especially those from the Hull area, attended this event and thus joined the network for the first time. These included practitioners, students, teachers, but also - significantly - it included a number of young people from local community organisations. Shami Chakrabarti, Director of Liberty, opened the event with a keynote address on 'Human Rights and the Educational Space'. She answered questions from the floor and stayed for a book signing. This was followed by a choice of four workshops: Prof David Leat (University of Newcastle) and Helen Burns (SOLE Central) on 'What would a 'Freedom to Learn' School, College, University or Community Setting be like?'; Janet Huscroft (Hook School) and Prof Michael Fielding (IoE) on 'Dare to Dream'; Prof Mike Neary (University of Lincoln) on 'Student as Producer and the Politics of Abolition'; Dan Ford, Dr Max Hope, Alys Mendus, Prof Catherine Montgomery (University of Hull) on 'Moving freedom forward: the legacy of Freedom to Learn'. The event ended with a closing address from Dr Patrick Yarker (Learning without Limits Project) speaking about 'Towards a Transformative Pedagogy'. The keynote addresses from Shami Chakrabarti and Dr Patrick Yarker were both filmed and are available on YouTube or via the URL below. Important impacts worthy of note are: first, the launch of the Call for Papers for a special issue of FORUM; second, the initial development of ideas for a 'manifesto' associated with the ideas of the project; third, the development of strong connections between participants based in Hull and beyond.
The project partners took the opportunity of the event in Hull to hold a team meeting to work on publications, dissemination, and plans for future collaborations.
Two postgraduate students were given bursaries to attend this event, both from University of Hull. They were both involved with co-ordinating the event and facilitating a workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.freedomtolearnproject.com/hull-9-march-16/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 2: Pedagogy and curriculum: The Danish Case (Oxford)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3B5D4481-96A9-46F2-A765-43318473B8E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the second of the seminar series and took place in Oxford on Thursday 12 March 2015, 12-5pm (Oxford Brookes University). This was an open event which had been widely advertised through our website, posters, emails, Facebook and Twitter. The aim of the event was to bring together practitioners, parents, teachers, students, academics, policy-makers and educational campaigners. Participants included about half of those who had attended the first seminar event in London, and many new practitioners, students, teachers and others, particularly those from the Oxford area, south-east and south-west of UK. Two keynotes speakers came from Denmark to share experiences of working in radical student-centred schools and universities (Associate Prof Ernst Schraube, Roskilde University and J&amp;oslash;rn West Larsen, Hellerup School). Prof Diane Reay (University of Cambridge) acted as discussant. All three of these were filmed and are available on YouTube or via the URL below. In addition to the two keynote sessions, there were four workshops (of which each participant was able to choose two). These were: 'Three decades of vibrant curriculum innovation' (Mike Davis, Human Scale Education and Jacquie Thomas, Stanley Park High School); 'Dialogic Learning Spaces (Dr Joanna Haynes and Dr Paul Warwick, Plymouth University); 'Makerspaces, Hackspaces and Fab Labs: Creative Pedagogies for Transforming Education?' (Sally Eaves, Aston University); 'Student as Producer: From Student Engagement to Radical Participation' (Prof Mike Neary, (University of Lincoln). The final hour of the day was spent in small group discussions about developing future collaborations. Important impacts worthy of note are: first, some new collaborations have been formed, through which new funding bids are being constructed (notably, Dr Max Hope, University of Hull and Dr Judith Suissa, Institute of Education); second, teachers and academics have started to make connections, including developing relationships between the UK and Denmark (and a new exchange scheme for undergraduate students has since been formalised between Roskilde University and the University of Hull).
Three postgraduate students were given bursaries to attend this event; one from University of Manchester and two from University of Hull.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.freedomtolearnproject.com/oxford-brookes-university-12-march-2015/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 1: Socially just education and inequalities: outlining the challenge (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7734F51-D2C8-4D9E-8D56-E6314F29EA68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the first of the seminar series and took place in London on Tuesday 14 October 2014, 12-5pm (Goodenough College). The aim of the event was to bring together a previously unconnected group of individuals who all had something to contribute in terms of the themes of the seminar series. Participants included people from schools and universities, from Education, Social Sciences, Geography, from those focussing on democracy, alternative education, inequalities. There was a mixture of professors, early career researchers, PhD students, and more. There were two keynotes sessions - one from Prof Diane Reay (University of Cambridge) and one from Prof Michael Fielding (Institute of Education, University of London). They launched the seminar series by outlining the challenges of developing social justice within neo-liberal educational systems, arguing that exploring radical and democratic alternatives might provide useful insights. These keynotes were followed by participative activities using a World Cafe format where participants could move from one discussion to another. Two important impacts are worthy of note: first, decisions were made about the future of the seminar series based on the democratic involvement of participants at event; second, connections were formed between individuals which have continued since this event (for example, Dr Helen Lees, Newman University and Prof Peter Kraftl, University of Leicester are working together on a funding bid and a new interdisciplinary seminar in Belgium).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.freedomtolearnproject.com/esrc-launch-event-a-call-to-action/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Launch and continual development of website, Facebook page, Twitter account, YouTube channel</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E7B2414-2910-40D8-9131-8589C30CB2D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ESRC seminar series has a clear and stated intention to reach beyond those in conventional academic circles, and to form an online interactive network of practitioners, teachers, parents, academics, students, educationalists, policy-makers and more. As part of developing this wider profile, a great deal of energy has been put into developing and maintaining a website, Facebook page and Twitter account. All keynotes lectures have been filmed and placed on our dedicated YouTube channel. These have, so far, received over 1750 views, suggesting that the reach of this medium extends far beyond those who have been able to attend the events in person. The Facebook page has over 640 'Likes', many of which are from members of the general public rather than from academics (one post achieved 6700 likes). The Twitter account has nearly 300 followers, including those from the UK, Norway, USA, Spain, Mexico, Denmark and Australia. Important impacts of developing and maintaining this website and other social media channels are: first, information about the events has been widely available, meaning that participants have been drawn from communities far beyond academic ones; second, ways of contacting project team members has been publically available, enhancing routes of communication. This has made a notable impact on the number of postgraduate students and teachers who have become involved with the project; third, members of this growing network is visible to others (especially through Twitter and Facebook), thus supporting people to make direct contact with one another; fourth, the website has a 'contact' facility, though which we have extended our mailing list.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.freedomtolearnproject.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 6: Thinking the yet to be thought: Education for the Future (Cardiff)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F473891-BF41-4BD4-8C87-CC6C48A13B5C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the sixth of the seminar series and took place in Cardiff on Tuesday 5 July 2016, 12-5pm (Wales Millennium Centre). This was an open event which had been widely advertised through our website, posters, emails, Facebook and Twitter. The aim of the event was to bring together practitioners, parents, teachers, students, academics, policy-makers and educational campaigners. Some participants had attended previous events, but there were a significant number of new people, including many from Wales. The theme was 'Thinking the Yet to be Thought: Education for the Future' which worked well in a futuristic venue like the Millennium Centre. The opening keynote session was by Prof Keri Facer (University of Bristol) on 'Using the Future in Education'. This was highly interactive and involved lively discussion in terms of how participants viewed 'the future' and their relationship with this. This session was followed by six different 'pitches' from the audience on how they wanted education to be developed for the future. These ideas had been submitted in advance, and the shortlisted six were selected for their innovation and diversity. They were: Pitch 1, David Leat (University of Newcastle), Making the case for community curriculum making; Pitch 2, David Gribble (international expert on democratic education), Advocating that democratic education is the best alternative; Pitch 3, Helen Lees (Newman University), Arguing that the future is home education; Pitch 4, Dan Ford (University of Hull), Imagining the future as wild pedagogy; Pitch 5, Gillian Hunt (Edinburgh), Envisioning 'fearless learning'; and Pitch 6, David Egan (University of Wales), Presenting a perspective from Wales. These pitches were followed by a group session which focussed on developing a manifesto on what 'freedom to learn' means and how the learning from this seminar series can be shared more widely. Important impacts worthy of note are: first, the ongoing development of the 'manifesto' associated with the ideas of the project; second, the development of the network to include colleagues from Wales.

This was an open event which had been widely advertised through our website, posters, emails, Facebook and Twitter. The aim of the event was to bring together practitioners, parents, teachers, students, academics, policy-makers and educational campaigners. Participants included some who had attended previous events, but mainly a new audience of academics, practitioners, students, teachers and others, particularly those from Scotland. Two keynotes speakers launched the event. These were Dr Velda McCune (University of Edinburgh) speaking on 'Learner Autonomy in Higher Education' and Prof Terry Wrigley (University of Northumbria) on 'Another School is Possible'. These were followed by an interactive storytelling-based group activity, facilitated by two PhD students from the University of Hull (Dan Ford and Alys Mendus). The event ended with an interactive panel addressing questions about ' what would a socially just education system look like?' Panel members were: 'The Real' David Cameron (Educational trainer, consultant, with extensive experience of supporting the development of education in Scotland); Prof Michael Fielding (Institute of Education, London); Dr Velda McCune (University of Edinburgh); Sue Palmer (author: Toxic Childhood: How The Modern World Is Damaging Our Children And What We Can Do About It); Prof Diane Reay (University of Cambridge); Imogen Wilson (Edinburgh University Students' Union Vice President Academic Affairs); Prof Terry Wrigley (University of Northumbria). The keynote speeches and the interactive panel were filmed and are available on YouTube or via the URL below. Important impacts worthy of note are: first, the development of strong connections between colleagues based in Scotland with each other, and with those based in the rest of the UK; second, the finalisation of a proposal to create a special issue for FORUM to accompany the seminar series. This has been accepted by the editors and will be published in Autumn 2016.

This was an open event which had been widely advertised through our website, posters, emails, Facebook and Twitter. The aim of the event was to bring together practitioners, parents, teachers, students, academics, policy-makers and educational campaigners. Participants included many of those who had attended the London and Oxford events, alongside many new academics, practitioners, students, teachers and others, particularly those from the Newcastle area, north-east and north-west of the UK. Two keynotes speakers were invited from the USA. Dr Wayne Au (University of Washington) opened the event with 'Unequal by Design or Assessing for Equity?' Prof Michael Apple (University of Wisconsin) closed with 'The Tasks of the Critical Scholar/Activist in Education' (both of these were filmed and are available on YouTube or via the URL below). In addition, four workshops were offered: 'Power and the academy: the role of students' unions within HE governance' (Prof Rachel Brooks, University of Surrey); 'Freedom from 'Closing the Gap'?' (Prof Liz Todd, University of Newcastle); 'Reimaging assessment and feedback in Higher Education' (Dr Will Curtis, University of Warwick) and Early Career Researcher Presentations (Dr Gill Davison and Millie Thomas, University of Sunderland; Stephen Broughton, Oxford Brookes University). Important impacts worthy of note are: first, strong connections were formed between colleagues at University of Newcastle and those in the partnership group which, it is hoped, will lead to further research collaborations; second, PhD students and early career researchers were given the opportunity to present their work alongside leading international experts in the field; third, relationships were established with the keynotes speakers who, as a result of this event, have been invited to contribute papers to a special issue of a journal.

This is entitled 'Alternative Education'. The main motivation for establishing the SIG came from Dr Helen Lees (Newman University), a key member of the project team. She become the first formal convenor of the SIG. Setting up this SIG involved gathering evidence of demand from BERA members, holding an inaugural meeting at the BERA Conference in September 2014 and adhering to all formal procedures for SIGs. At the BERA Conference in September 2015 (Belfast), there were 8 papers presented as part of this SIG, four of which were part of a symposium. At BERA Conference 2016 (Leeds), there were double this quantity which signifies the growing interest in this work. In October 2016, Dr Max Hope (University of Hull - PI for this project) became the co-convenor of the Alternative Education SIG. She will work closely with Dr Helen Lees to organise an event for March 2017 which will build on this seminar series and continue to develop collaborations. There are currently over 50 members of the BERA Alternative Education SIG.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.bera.ac.uk/group/alternative-education</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 7: Future Directions Seminar (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2388107-B79F-4E75-9679-E6E946866533</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was the final one of the seminar series and took place in London on Tuesday 20 September 2016, 12-5pm (Goodenough College). As it was the final event, the focus was slightly different from the others. Everyone who had attended any one of the previous six events were invited (totally 295 people) so that we could reflect upon the learning throughout the series and consider the future for this work. The final version of the printed 'manifesto' was launched and multiple copies distributed to participants. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive with many participants commenting on how well it had captured the central values and principles that had been discussed throughout the series. They also welcomed the small, compact, innovative design which resulted in a small credit-card size 'pocket guide' to freedom, autonomy and social justice in education. This will now be turned into a web-friendly version so that it has a lifespan beyond that of the paper copies.
The forthcoming Special Issue of FORUM: for promoting 3-19 comprehensive education was also unveiled. This consists of fourteen new papers on themes of freedom, autonomy and social justice. Some of the authors are new to publishing and include teachers, practitioners, doctoral students and young people themselves. Their papers are published alongside those of eminent internationally-renowned scholars in this field such as Prof Diane Reay (University of Cambridge), Dr Wayne Au (University of Washington) and Prof Kitty to Reile (University of Victoria). 
This event also included elements of appreciative inquiry, facilitated by Dr Paul Warwick (University of Plymouth), where participants were invited to think about the past and the future and to consider how they might contribute to this. A number of interesting and exciting options were discussed from through this process, some of which will be undertaken by individuals, and some by small groups.
The project partners took the opportunity of the final event in London to hold a team meeting to consider the sustainability of this work. Several important outcomes resulted from this: a) a closer relationship will be fostered with the BERA Alternative Education Special Interest Group so that the network of participants can be directly linked in with other activities; b) an annual conference will be held, organised and hosted by a different University on each occasion (the first will be in March 2017 at Newman University); c) opportunities for offering immersive 'alternative education' experiences will be explored and advertised to the network; d) the website, Facebook page and online profile will be developed so that the high profile of the work is sustained and the network continues to grow; e) a symposium will be organised for the BERA conference in 2017.
Three postgraduate students were given bursaries to attend this event; two from University of Hull and one from University of Manchester. Two of these were involved in the project team meeting as well as the main event.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.freedomtolearnproject.com/final-esrc-seminar-series-event-takes-place-in-london/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>49991</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Spencer Small Grant (Purpose and Values of Education)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-01-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Spencer Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>201600140</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A82F3837-094A-48B7-8373-43042E9780A0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>47200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>British Council Researcher Links Mexico</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>4CE85CF3-7A77-4933-B3A1-684A618080FC</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A tangible output from this series has been the production of a 'manifesto' which summarises the key findings from the project.
