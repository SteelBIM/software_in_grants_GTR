How one defines torture, who sets the standards and how one implements these are now matters of international and national importance.\n\nThe standards relating to torture have been created through international law. This has been done in a number of ways, most notably through written agreements between states (known as treaties) which create legal obligations for states. There are also a number of other documents which are created over which there is a question as to whether they create legal obligations. These are known as 'soft law' documents. On the one hand states and others are more likely to agree to these documents because they are not binding. However, the content of them can develop the detail on what states should do to prevent torture, for example, and various organisations and actors may use them to try to set standards for states and hold them to account. Although there has been some literature on their role and their potential importance in setting and developing legal standards, less attention has been paid to practical examples of these type of documents and to considering how they are used by states, non-governmental organisations and others, whether internationally or within particular countries.\n\nThis research takes one example of a 'soft law' document, the Robben Island Guidelines on the Prevention of Torture (RIG) and aims to consider how they were created, whether they create legal obligations, how they are used internationally and nationally and how the standards within them can be implemented. The Robben Island Guidelines were created under the regional human rights body for Africa, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, and they set out requirements for states to prevent and criminalise torture.\n\nThis is a unique opportunity for high value research in this contentious area of torture given the background and experience of both the Principal Investigator, Co-Applicant and the Research Assistant. \n\nThe Principal Investigator and the Research Assistant will carry out a literature review relating to soft law before examining the documents and material of the African Commission and its Follow Up Committee established to implement the RIG. It will also undertake a series of trips to several African countries to determine views on the use of the Guidelines nationally. A series of seminars will also be held. A PhD studentship will track what mechanisms are available to prevent torture in one African state of the candidate's choice.\n\nThe outputs of the research will be both academic and practical.They will include a book length study on the Creation and Implementation of Standards of Torture, and several articles in leading journals on torture and the strategic use of soft law. More practically, the research will involve seminars the result of which shall be the adoption of policy papers and guidance on implementation of RIG, including a strategic plan for the Follow Up Committee on implementation of RIG. The seminars will bring together members of the Follow Up Committee and other international organisations such as the APT and national bodies such as police and prison ombudsmen and NGOs, as well as government and others to discuss implementation of RIG. A final conference at the end of the project will examine the role of soft law in international human rights law. This will invite key individuals and organisations from the field of international law generally as well as RIG in particular. The research will also provide a website on the RIG and their implementation. A PhD will be completed within the period of the project. \n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>576329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open Society Foundation, New York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Open Society Justice Initiative</gtr:department><gtr:description>Open Society Justice Initiative group collaboration on litigation before the African Commission</gtr:description><gtr:id>F27454F0-82E3-492A-ADA7-AC960283ABA8</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Invited to be part of group collaboration involving lead NGOs working on enhancing litigation and follow up before the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cape Town</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Cape Town</gtr:description><gtr:id>9DBB828C-62DE-4A11-8BB8-A82794F7A913</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>As a result of this project, we were invited to become partners on a European Commission funded grant looking at the implementation of Article 5 in six African states.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Amnesty International</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Working with Amnesty International to update their Combating Torture Manual</gtr:description><gtr:id>68A61DED-39F0-45E3-9624-E3FD07A6BA72</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>As a result of our work on this project we have been invited to work with Amnesty International to update their Combating Torture Manual.

Our project aimed to examine from a very practical perspective issues about the use of soft law. We have done this through detailed analysis of one soft law document of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights namely the 'Guidelines and Measures for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture, Cruel and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa' (Robben Island Guidelines) (RIG). We considered that through tracking the development and subsequent use of one soft law document the IHRS project could contribute to a better understanding as to how soft-law documents impact upon the development of international human rights law. While the focus of the project was on the use of the RIG, and soft law documents generally, rather than compliance, issues relating to compliance have been looked at impliedly. Furthermore, while the RIG has been used as a case study, during the course of the research we also looked at a number of other types of soft law documents such as concluding observations of treaty bodies, resolutions and individual communications. This led to look at what forms of follow-up there should be to these documents. The project findings indicate the following:

1. Use of the RIG by the African Commission:

We found that there was very limited reference by the African Commission itself to the RIG in all aspects of its work. This included in its resolutions, decisions on individual communications, concluding observations and other documents. Where there was reference to the RIG, this was mostly in passing often referring to it as a document rather than any specific provisions, and frequently the RIG are not mentioned in isolation but in conjunction with a range of instruments. Although there are a few examples of communications which make reference to particular provisions of the RIG. 

2. References to the RIG within the UN human rights mechanisms

Our research also examined references to the RIG by the UN human rights mechanisms. Here we found a number of incidences where the RIG have been referenced by UN mechanisms not just in passing but in a more substantive way. In particular the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture has referenced the RIG in a number of reports on missions to countries where the mandate holder called on the respective State to &amp;quot;abide by&amp;quot; the RIG. The SRT has also mentioned specific provisions of the RIG in reports to the UN General Assembly and in joint reports with other UN Special Procedures. In addition the RIG has also been references in a number of press releases by the SRT. References to the RIG by other UN Mechanisms is limited, although instances of NGOs referencing them in their documents submitted to the UN were found.

3. Domestically:

Our research does not claim to be comprehensive as we did not visit all states across the continent and therefore our findings are more a snapshot of how RIG has been received and used at the national level. We conducted research visits to Egypt, Ethiopia, The Gambia, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda. In deciding upon which States to visit we strategically chose States from different regions of the Continent and ensured we included States which had received visits by the CPTA or Follow-up Committee, and/or the APT,and those which had not. .



We found that overall, the majority of interviewees had not heard of the RIG prior to our research visit. Very few people had heard of the RIG. Of those that had only a handful have actually used RIG in their work. Where it has been used this has been as one of a number of reference tools for drafting legislation or awareness raising on an issue mostly around the criminalisation of torture, for example in Uganda the RIG was used as one of the resources for preparing the Torture Prevention Bill but it was one of a number and no reference to it has been made to the RIG in the preamble to the Bill, so its use is &amp;quot;hidden&amp;quot;. 



We did discern that knowledge of the RIG seems to be dependent on whether or not the Follow-up Committee, CPTA or APT has actually visited the country and organisation, or if the organisation or individual had attended a session of the African Commission. 



Some broader findings.

These findings have led to some broader findings from the research.

(a) Preference for UN instruments and standards rather than African documents in practice, despite rhetoric that useful.



One perhaps surprising finding from our analysis of the RIG is that while on the one hand, we are told that their merit and relevance comes from the fact that they are an African document adopted by the African Commission and that they were to 'Africanise international standards', in reality most would turn to the UN standards first. Those who claimed that regional standards are better because they will be closer to the culture and context of Africa did not in fact use the regional instruments over international.



(b) A mechanism for implementing soft law



It is unusual to have a mechanism to follow up a non-binding document and the appointment of a follow-up committee, now the CPTA, to monitor the RIG was therefore welcomed. However, there are a number of issues raised in this regard with respect to the ability of the RIG to have an impact.



Firstly, despite the rhetoric that the RIG are an important African document, their use at all levels is very limited. This is not wholly negative however. This, as outlined above, appears to be the result of strong and accepted international instruments as well as a lack of awareness of the existence and content of the RIG. There is a recognition that where there are gaps, the RIG can usefully fill these spaces if the African Commission and its CPTA are prepared to develop further guidance and standards in these areas. In addition, many pointed to the continued need for the existence and use of the RIG as having a symbolic relevance as an African document and in its ability to bring together some key international issues in training and advocacy contexts. These areas include, but are not limited to, OPCAT and prevention.



There was also a desire for the CPTA's capacity in terms of its membership to be broadened, with perhaps increased involvement of other actors such as NHRIs. The need for the CPTA, in collaboration with the other special mechanisms of the African Commission, to develop standards, comments and guidelines on torture related issues was also felt to be worthwhile endeavour. However, we also found that it was crucial that the mandates of the CPTA and the Special Rapporteur on Prisons in particular be debated in more detail and practical tools developed to ensure that they support and strengthen rather than overlap or duplicate each others' work.



(c) binding versus non-binding?



On the whole there was a preference to make reference and to use binding standards first and then to look at non-binding standards. In particular this was noticeable in litigation where I think everyone involved in litigation stated that they would of course use binding instruments first and it seemed odd to them to even consider non-binding standards. (I often struggled with people involved in litigation to get them to understand why we looking at non-binding standards and these proved to be the most difficult interviews to explain to people why I was asking questions about binding and non-binding documents.) In litigation many I spoke to appeared wary to use non-binding standards in their litigation and in particular non-binding standards that were not domestic standards because the judges would not view these non-binding, &amp;quot;foreign&amp;quot; standards as relevant or applicable within their jurisdiction. It was mentioned to me on numerous occasions that judges are not well informed about international and regional standards.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E9AEB2F-4D7F-405B-A779-2372B7782801</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influencing the work of NHRIs in monitoring implementation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D01CD0CE-9951-43C8-AF7A-A05901123826</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Influenced NHRIs in terms of their monitoring of implementation of decisions on human rights violations in their countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influencing the policy of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CAE1A6D-9CD4-4992-9C5F-51684079F2D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our findings from this project and seminars held during the lifetime of this project have aimed to engage directly with stakeholders, including the African Commission on Human and peoples' Rights.
