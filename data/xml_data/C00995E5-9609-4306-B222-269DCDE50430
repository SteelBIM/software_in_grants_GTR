&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to promote knowledge sharing between researchers and practitioners through the development of a new web-based discussion forum&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to increase research awareness about interventions for ASD for people who need to evaluate them, through the provision of research-aware leaflets, a research toolkit and workshops on intervention (project partners - charities National Autistic Society and Waterloo Foundation)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to bring the research ?laboratory? closer to people's lives, through engagement activities and communication packages (a DVD and booklet on neuroimaging research).&lt;/li>

The majority were non-academic clinical or educational professionals who discussed topics including diagnosis, interventions, anxiety and sensory issues, and multi-disciplinary working. The forum was used to coordinate discussion in advance of two international meetings. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation data revealed difficulties in site navigation and greater suitability for more focused discussion topics with clear incentives.

? Professional development opportunities were created by meeting researchers online, learning about international research projects and gaining access to written resources stored within the online forum.
? A direct early impact of this work was that the project team applied for and were awarded a new ESRC knowledge exchange grant, &amp;quot;Developing a research-policy-practice Hub(&amp;pound;200,000). This work has been supported by Welsh Government in matched funding. The new grant capitalises directly on the original project. It builds on the team's experience of useability challenges in online contexts and focuses on working across both practitioner and policy communities. The project also consolidates collaborations with charities and with Bangor University and involves policy consultant placement visits at Cardiff University.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Aware Booklet</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6B4520D6-6035-491F-9329-CFC9182EBF1A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The booklet raised positive feedback from parents and also from the Charity Research Autism.

The workshop was then repeated twice in South Wales focus only on ESDM. The first event was attended by 60 and the other two by 20 each.

Awareness of the importance of early intervention was raised. As a direct outcome, 23 clinicians obtained new early intervention training sponsored by the Welsh Gov and therefore this initiative led to 28 new children obtaining intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researchers on the Road</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B7805FC-C574-426E-B9AB-5266D1AA0B11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The visits to parent groups around the country generated questions and discussion and raised awareness about research

The event was co-organised by members of the Wales Autism Research Centre (including Dr Louise White) and the NAS group. Although not within the original grant application, this event was a clear opportunity for dissemination of the grant outcomes. Moreover, this opportunity was also used to feedback the results from an additional research study within the centre.

This knowledge exchange grant led to three main developments. The first was the provision of a new knowledge sharing opportunity designed for practitioners and researchers who work in the field of autism spectrum disorder. We developed the first stage design of a new web-based forum for sharing expert knowledge. In the small scale trials, 171 individuals registered with the AWARES-talk forum, including individuals from UK, Japan, Sweden, and USA. The majority were non-academic professionals who discussed topics including diagnosis, interventions, anxiety and sensory issues, and multi-disciplinary working. 

The second development was a research awareness raising exercise in the non-academic community. Awareness of research in the area of early intervention was raised through three workshops on evidence-based intervention for health practitioners led by an international expert from the USA Prof Rogers who gave presentations on a new intervention -Early Start Denver Model. One workshop was expanded to include researchers who led two UK-based interventions. Research awareness in parents was also raised through the production of a Research Aware Booklet which helps orient parents to the importance of looking for evidence when choosing an intervention for their child and the production of a Research Toolkit, a resource for non-academics to help them appraise the scientific content of interventions. 

The third development was to increase direct engagement with users of future research, through the provision of engagement activities and improved communication. We carried out Researchers on the Road meetings with 25 parent group leaders, representing approximately 100 members. A DVD now on Youtube was produced to introduce neuroimaging techniques to families and a booklet distributed to 780 people.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of this project formed the basis for the subsequent development of the Research-Policy-Practice Hub, an ESRC funded project that can be used by practitioners and policy workers. The early intervention workshops led to new intervention training sponsored by the Welsh Gov leading to benefits for children receiving early intervention. The engagement activities highlighted what parents needed i terms of areas for improved communication that can be addresses by better website information and resources.



The aim of the toolkit is to increase research awareness for individuals who need to evaluate research evidence and will therefore be of benefit to practitioners, government or charity advisors, and individuals working in health or educational intervention programmes. The Research Toolkit document has also been distributed to contacts related to the 'What Works' initiative, including Rachel Tuffin (the College of Policing), and to Prof. Leon Feinstein of the Early Intervention Foundation. We have also recommended that the Research Aware leaflet is included in post diagnostic packs in other health boards across Wales and in England.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>29DA6CD0-418C-4CE1-9976-22B54B58491A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/warc/files/2014/06/Integrating-research-and-practice-in-ASD-Project-Report-September-2010.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9C88D00B-A990-47B4-8650-A2E97BF5B505"><gtr:id>9C88D00B-A990-47B4-8650-A2E97BF5B505</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sharing research evidence about autism: how do we do it?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Developmental Disabilities</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0a4beb1b2347562a7630abe67c15cf2"><gtr:id>a0a4beb1b2347562a7630abe67c15cf2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carrington, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4A873268-943B-4535-AE55-E586EF6D95B1"><gtr:id>4A873268-943B-4535-AE55-E586EF6D95B1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Knowledge acquisition and research evidence in autism: Researcher and practitioner perspectives and engagement.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in developmental disabilities</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f5f3576329882aa63e7921f60b1976ec"><gtr:id>f5f3576329882aa63e7921f60b1976ec</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carrington SJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0891-4222</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/14D34650-BD82-476F-ABEF-44E8556244E3"><gtr:id>14D34650-BD82-476F-ABEF-44E8556244E3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Integrating research policy and practice in Autism Spectrum Disorders</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Society for Autism Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/93b27d63f58c271cf7cb36f6d772e6b4"><gtr:id>93b27d63f58c271cf7cb36f6d772e6b4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>White, L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5B5009CC-266D-474C-AF4B-E0DD86B03DD8"><gtr:id>5B5009CC-266D-474C-AF4B-E0DD86B03DD8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Engaging members of a community in research</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/52da0470ddc7957881ad7e162c14acaf"><gtr:id>52da0470ddc7957881ad7e162c14acaf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Price, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-189-25-0275</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I030085/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5858EC49-4786-4440-8352-1AB0B6DC5F23</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Psychology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
