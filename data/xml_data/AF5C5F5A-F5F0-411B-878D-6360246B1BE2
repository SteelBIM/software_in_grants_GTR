The populations of the honeybee and wild pollinators have rapidly declined due to habitat change, global warming and disease. There is a burden of responsibility for researchers and public bodies to explore ways to halt this decline. To date, most of the response to this challenge has been led by natural and social/economic scientists and although the arts community has worked on awareness raising projects there has been little collaboration. Responding to this observation, this network will bring together arts researchers with natural and social scientists, beneficiaries and policy makers to 
explore the role that the arts can play in increasing understanding of the causes of the decline in pollinator populations and influence policy decisions to help halt this decline.

By bringing the network members together the 'Cross-pollination' project will: 
- help scientists produce better understandings of pollinator decline; 
- explore new collaborative ways of working where the perspectives of the 'arts' and 'sciences' enrich each other; 
- help change the perceived value of pollinators; 
- and effectively influence decision-making.

Drawing on existing networks, Liggins (PI) and Christie (Co-I) will bring together key researchers, artists and stakeholders to participate in a series of exploratory arts workshops that will explore theories of aesthetics, sensory perception, differences in perspectives and language, and investigate possible creative interactions and partnerships. From these meetings a series of speculative art interventions will be set up to produce art works and explore ideas arising from the collaborations. Using the methodology of the 'Art Crit', not normally used within the scientific community, Cross-pollination will enable researchers from various disciplines and stakeholders to interrogate the art process, to share reflections, and explore the range of value judgments. Throughout the process, artists will be partnered with scientists and decision makers with the expectation that a future research agenda will be developed. 

Confirmed participants include award winning scientists in the area of pollinator research from the UK and USA and high profile arts researchers from the fields of aesthetics, perception and community arts. An important addition are two linguists studying the language of environmental research and its affect on perceived values. The Co-I Christie's expertise in the Valuation of Nature for Ecosystem Service Sustainability, will provide a further focus for the project. PI Liggins has undertaken a number of science/art projects, most recently with the NBGW and is presently contributing to the NERC project Duress Theme 5 led by Co-I Christie to deliver research through arts practice, particularly looking at differences in perception of value.

A number of the representatives in policy making organisations are also involved, such as Pollinator Taskforce Wales, Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) Deliverable 3a Global Pollinator Assessment. Co-I Christie has led a number of research projects involved in the economic evaluation of nature and bio-diversity and was PI the NERC Valuing Nature Steering project. Further confirmed beneficiaries, who have been involved in the development of Cross-pollination include the BumbleBee Conservation Trust (Bee Wild project), BugLife, The Bee Garden at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (NBGW), Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, and the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales 120 Miles of Garden project. The NBGW, where some events will take place, is well-placed to disseminate many of the ideas and findings to the general public, as there is an established Bee Garden Visitors Centre, and there are already links with other National Gardens, such a Royal National Garden of Scotland and the Nanshan Botanic Gardens in China.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>From the outset organisations, policy makers and individuals who will benefit from the research findings will take part in the structured process of collaboration. The stakeholders listed below are confirmed network members and have been consulted in-depth on the development of Cross-pollination in order that the project maximises its potential impacts. 

On a national level the project has ensured that for example the Welsh Pollinator Taskforce are active through the process as two key participants are members. The range of key participants have been carefully planned to maximise the opportunities for more inclusion of artists and arts researchers policy-making boards.

On a global level confirmed network participant Potts (Reading University) is a key member of the Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and Chair of the IPBIS Deliverable 3a Global Pollinator Assessment. This organisation acts as an interface between the scientific community and policymakers to build capacity for and strengthen the use of science in policy making and address gaps in the science-policy interface on biodiversity and ecosystem services. This organisation is currently looking at the socio-cultural, indigenous and other values associated with pollinators and pollination, and Cross-pollination will directly contribute to the assessment and via IPBES to policy making globally. The U.S.A. for example last year launched a Pollinator Health Task Force, after seeing a 23% reduction in bee populations, therefor it is important that this project involves international participants (Graystock), to internationalise the range of impacts, and ensure a more international representation.

Co-I Christie has been PI on a number of NERC and Defra funded projects for valuing ecosystem services for biodiversity, a contributor to the UK National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), which in turn helped shape the UK Government's Natural Environment White Paper. He is at present lead investigator of the Valuation Theme of the DURESS project (Diversity in Upland Rivers for Ecosystem Service Sustainability), and through key participation in Cross-pollination will be able to network the findings through a broad range of policy-makers and develop new methodologies for both economic and non-economic environment valuation projects. 

Organisations who will ensure that any findings are incorporated into the public face of their enterprises are Dr Beynon's Bug farm and The Bee Garden at the NBGW, the Bee Wild Project (Bumblebee Conservation Trust) in West Wales, and the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales, 120 miles Station Gardens project. The former is a new centre opening in West Wales, the brainchild of the entomologist and TV presenter, Beynon, whose award winning research is in the field of beetles. At present the Farm is conducting field studies into farmland biodiversity, ecosystem services provided by wildlife particularly Lowland Heath (a priority habitat in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan), and the future of sustainable food production. Over the next few years a Public Tourist Centre is being developed at the site to enhance public awareness of the importance of insects for sustaining biodiversity. Beynon is a key participant and the art/science interactions of this project will have impact through this commercial enterprise. The Bee Garden at NBGW will display on-going findings of the project and the artworks. In addition the Garden holds training days and events for bee-keepers and Growing for Diversity.

In addition ongoing Blog and Social Media will commentate on the process of the project. This will be linked to the NBGW and to the UWTSD INSPIRE websites. The BBC One Show and BBC Spring-Watch have previously featured De Vere, Lucas and Beynon, and it is expected that this project will attract similar media coverage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36113</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Safekeeping Bees, Symposium Plymouth University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>171763E1-8CBD-4E10-B0BC-C76C2DB4A475</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Safekeeping Bees was an Interdisciplinary Exploration of the Future of Bees in Britain.

Beynon and Tombs gave a talk on the science and art perspectives of insects, and then using recycled materials, the children made 'musical' instruments to imitate insect noises. Alongside this, they learnt about the science behind how and why bugs make sounds (e.g. grasshopper stridulation). They recorded their sounds individually and using the MadPad app on a iPad to make the sounds, which they then recorded together by the children as an insect orchestra. The resulting piece of music was then played back to them in an empty grain silo.

During 7th and 8th April 2016 the Intro Networking Event took place at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Alex Campus, Swansea and the National Botanic Garden of Wales.
During March the key participants of the project were finalised, and these attended this event joined by further interested parties. All the participants came together to share ideas, discuss their wide-ranging research and start the collaboration process.
The main aim of the Networking Intro Event was to initiate an inter-disciplinary research network on the vital subject of pollinators. During the project this network, through collaborative art projects, will explore how science and art research can interact to create new ideas and innovative methodologies for research into pollinators.
Participants of the event included award-winning scientists in the area of pollinator research from the UK and USA, high profile artists and arts researchers from the fields of aesthetics, perception and community arts. Important additions were linguists studying the language of environmental research and its affect on perceived values. The project leader Professor Andrea Liggins (University of Wales Trinity Saint David) has undertaken a number of science/art projects, most recently with Dr De Vere Head of Science and Conservation at the National Botanic Garden of Wales. Professor Michael Christie's (Aberystwyth University) expertise in the Valuation of Nature for Ecosystem Service Sustainability provided a further focus for the event.
A number of the representatives in policy-making organisations were also involved, such as members of the Pollinator Taskforce Wales and the Intergovernmental Science -Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Co-I Christie has led a number of research projects focussing on the economic evaluation of nature and bio-diversity and was PI for the NERC Valuing Nature Steering project. Further participants at this event, included the Bumblebee Conservation Trust (Bee Wild project), BugLife, The Bee Garden at the National Botanic Garden of Wales (NBGW), Dr Beynon's Bug Farm, a representative from Natural Resources Wales (also a scientist), and a representative of the Heart of Wales Line and Arriva Trains Wales 120 Miles of Bee Garden project.
Day One started with presentations about art/science collaborations from the perspective of firstly the artist and then the scientist. These presentations were followed by sixteen Pecha Kucha, where each participant had 6 minutes and 40 seconds to describe their research.
PechaKucha or Pecha Kucha (pronounced 'pech-a-kee-shoe' and is Japanese for 'chit-chat') is a presentation style in which 20 slides are shown for 20 seconds each (6 minutes and 40 seconds in total). The format was conceived to keep presentations concise and fast-paced. Pecha Kucha has been used by artists and designers to view several presentations within a short time period.
This was followed by a speed-networking event where each individual scientist and artist had a chance to meet and discuss possible collaborative art projects for 15 mins.
Day Two progressed from these introductions with the objectives of sharing ideas and forming collaborative partnerships. The enthusiasm of the participants was tangible resulting in a multitude of possible art/science projects, which were arranged under themes. These were:-
1. Farming and Environment Policy
2. Multi-model
3. Pollinators and their Habitats
4. Preservation (Wild Bees)
5. Communication
6. Lines and Journeys
7. Perception and Motivation
Professor Mike Christie summed up in a presentation on the potential of the project to influence policy-making and this was followed by a tour of the National Botanic Garden of Wales, with a focus on the new butterfly house in the making by Head of Science and Conservation, Dr Natasha De Vere.
Follow-on Meetings
The thematic groups met in person (including visits to The Bee Lab Bristol, Dr Beynon's Bug Farm and the Science Lab at the National Botanic Garden of Wales) and via Skype to discuss and finalise the individual Art/Science projects. From these meetings, which took place prior to September 2016, a large number of art outputs were agreed, twice as many that were in the AHRC proposal. The networking to date therefor had been very successful, but more funding was required. An application to the Arts Council of Wales was made, which was successful and this ensured that the following projects could progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project will not be complete until 31st November 2017. The Cross-pollination project is a networking project and as a result of bringing artists, scientists and stakeholders together initial impacts have already been achieved.
a) The Chair of Heart of Wales Railway Development Group was invited to the Introductory Networking Event as this group was planning bee friendly gardens at each of the 27 stations on the line. At this event a suggestion was made by one of the attending artists for each station on the Heart of Wales Line ( Arriva Trains) to 'adopt' a species of bee. Following discussions of the concept an executive decision was taken in September 2016 to re-name The Heart of Wales Line from Llanelli to Shrewsbury (Arriva Trains) as The Bee Line, with stations along the route being branded for different bee species, and bee gardens at each station being developed with assistance of scientists involved in the project, from the National Botanic Garden of Wales and the Bumblebee Conservation Trust. Although not passing through populous areas, this line is primarily a tourist line and the renaming and branding will enhance the public's awareness of the plight of the bee, as well as other pollinators, particularly as it is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2018 . The collaboration from the scientists with the volunteers developing the gardens will ensure greater success with this initiative.
b) The collaboration of Professor Andrea Liggins PI (arts and photography researcher) with Andrew Lucas, ( hoverfly scientist/researcher working for Natural Resources Wales) has resulted in some early impact. Liggin's research has been focused on finding ways of imaging those type of landscapes that have been seen to date as having little visual value, the lowland peat-bog, the grasslands and hedgerows. It is this type of environment, namely wet grassland, that is the preferred habitat of the hoverfly and some trial photographic artworks have been produced. Lucas believes that these non-descriptive, atmospheric images of his study sites, may help to convey the essence and in turn value of these non-picturesque and often overlooked landscapes. Therefor, the photographs have been and will be included in a number of papers and presentations by Lucas. Natural Resources Wales have decided to use them on their website under the theme of grassland management. Presentations to date include to the annual meeting of The British Ecological Society as well as three regional conservation groups. This collaboration is continuing.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1B9163F1-6E02-476E-AA36-9A4BEA006722</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As Cross-pollination is a network project due to be completed 31st November 2017 the findings are at present initial findings. Only one aspect of the expected findings is described here, that of examining the perceptions of artists and scientists of one another and their disciplines, with the objective of developing greater understanding to inform this project and future art/science collaborations.
After the 2 day Intro Networking Event the participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to examine perceptions held at the beginning of the project. The questionnaire was designed and analyzed by Dr Sophie Bennett from Aberystwyth University. Two additional questionnaire surveys are planned to look at any changes of perception during the life of the project.
Section from Analysis of Cross-Pollination Questionnaire One - April 2016
Respondent profile
The majority of questionnaire are female (75%), based in Wales and are 35 years of age or over (64%). Most participants described themselves as scientists (42%) or artists (33%). 
Summary of results 
1. Difference between disciplines 
Results from the questionnaire indicate that, overall, participants do not view arts and science as completely distinct disciplines. The majority of participants were able to work with others around them, no matter what their discipline and became less aware of any differences as the event progressed. The commonality between disciplines was mentioned by some participants and realised during the networking event. Where differences do occur, participants described these as being differences of methods and methodology, education and overall focus. This was described by a number of participants as the difference in focus between end goal and process. Scientists use a framework of evidence and metrics to reach an end goal, whereas the arts concern themselves with the process, using qualitative methods and intuition. This was described by one participant as:
I still find it difficult to understand how a process can be useful if there is no end goal! In science, you talk about a piece of research in terms of what you found out. It sometimes seems condescending to ask an artist why they did something or what that art actually means/depicts.
Some participants describe differences as a result of opposite perspectives, where scientists use hypotheses to begin with and artists use grounded theory to arrive at a hypothesis: 
Formulating a hypothesis which is proven/disproved if often used in the scientific research and grounded theory where experimental works leads to the formulations of a hypothesis is used in artistic research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to tell.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E1E28F8D-0E45-4BCB-90D2-3DAC5C7DA22D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://crosspollinationartsciencecollaboration.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/N00597X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>1A1A6805-9DC4-4BCE-BC70-9F2AA4FD093B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ecol, biodivers. &amp; systematics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B94A2498-60DA-4055-A957-686B6CB42654</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BC807E7B-C08E-46F6-9E44-E65554CFBA4B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Linguistics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5020ECC8-E0E8-434D-BDD5-663A9C04EFA2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Conservation Ecology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A8CCE2FA-9D1B-4880-9BD3-C4C078F9CD7F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Fine Art HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1BF93D24-EF76-46A8-848B-CCD6008D74BC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Photography HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
