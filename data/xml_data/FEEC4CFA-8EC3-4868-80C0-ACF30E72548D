of cost in deploying innovative measurement, control and protection functions for the power network requires to be proven
in the context of relevant industry standards, with particular emphasis on current and voltage measurements.
Consequently, the core research idea of this proposal is to assess the feasibility of this undertaking through systematic
research and implementation of a range of innovative error compensation methods. In particular, the feasibility study will
aim to demonstrate that metering and protection accuracy classes for voltage and current transducers are attainable by this
technology.
In order to address the objectives of the project, the research programme will be subdivided into specific work packages.
The scope and methodologies adopted with respect to the individual tasks are described in the Case for Support
attachment under the following work packages:
WP1. Engagement with stakeholders (Month 1-12)
WP2. Design and simulation of transducers and experiments. (Month 1-7)
WP3. Assembly and packaging of electrical current and voltage transducers. (Month 4-7)
WP4. Characterisation and environmental/high-voltage stress testing of transducers (Month 7-12)
WP5. Development and testing of sensor interrogation hardware and software. (Month 1-12)</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project stands to make a huge impact on the UK economy by taking to market, via a new SME vehicle, a groundbreaking
technology. Since this sensing technology is able to leverage the standard telecomunication-grade optical fibres
that are installed on power networks, it could lead to the elimination of many costs conventionally associated with power
network instrumentation, and simultaneously address the challenge of providing wide-area sensor coverage with minimal
investment. This could lead to greater integration of our electrical and environmental sensing systems, and to extensive,
wide-area, real-time knowledge of electrical transmission and distribution systems.
This project aims therefore to address the entirety of the 'energy trilemma' within the scope of early-stage feasibility
funding, in order to maximise the positive impact of this technology by demonstrating its excellent economic potential.
Strathclyde and Synaptec has conducted in-depth interviews with Alstom, Siemens, ABB, Toshiba, and S&amp;amp;C Electric
Company and a range of network operators relating to the efficacy of the technology and its market potential. All interviewees were confident that the market potential is very high, at both high-voltage transmission level and at medium
voltage distribution level, and particularly where fibre is pre-installed. Based on discussions with end users and potential
partners, the impacts of taking the technology towards market through this project are described below:
1. Reduced costs to consumers through savings on network operators' costs:
Synaptec and Strathclyde's conversations with major UK power network operators have shown that deployment of this
technology could vastly reduce the cost of instrumenting network sections by up to 90% by removing the requirements for
civil infrastructure investment in sensing locations, and by eliminating the need for supporting telecommunications and
power supplies. The financial benefits accrued by network operators must be passed on as cost savings to their customers,
ultimately reducing the cost of electrical utility bills in the UK.
2. Improved security of energy supply:
By providing a cost-effective method to provide more extensive instrumentation and protection of the power transmission
and distribution network, the large-scale affordable deployment of the technology will curtail the impact of faults (e.g. short
circuits), leading to a reduction in both the duration and the geographical reach of power outages (black-outs) experienced
by energy customers in the UK. This in turn leads to further savings for network operators by reducing penalty metrics such
as customer-minutes-lost.
3. Reduced emissions through integration of low-carbon technologies:
The provision of extensive, cost-effective visibility of the network status at all points on the system increases its
responsiveness and stability. This level of awareness and control is crucial to enabling network operators to permit higher
levels of renewable generation and energy storage devices to be connected to the network. Enabling a higher penetration
of renewables will lead to a reduction in carbon emissions and will contribute to a more sustainable and diversified future
energy system.
This project is likely therefore to have both large scientific and economic impact which will be ensured through continual
engagement with UK industry which stands to benefit greatly from the development and ultimate commercialisation of this
innovative technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>148054</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Strathclyde</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Power Network Demonstration Centre</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration partnership on the Mid-Stage Innovate UK Energy Catalyst Bid</gtr:description><gtr:id>56E9E76E-9375-403B-9255-137E75302571</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A successful Mid-Stage Innovate UK Energy Catalyst Award.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>NPL will bring in expertise in metrology, ITL in instrument transformers, Bellrock in cloud-based condition monitoring systems, and PNDC will offer expertise and facilities to test the new transducers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The consortium was established to jointly carry out a new R&amp;amp;D project, a follow up to the present project.
