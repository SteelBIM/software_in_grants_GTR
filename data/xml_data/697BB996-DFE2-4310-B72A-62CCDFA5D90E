On the 17th November 2009, a memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between SVVU, Tirupati and University of Nottingham (UoN). Two early career scientists from SVVU, Dr K.V Subramanyam and Dr R.N. Ramani Pushpa were later awarded India distinguished visiting fellowships (IDVF) by the UoN for a 3 month research sabbatical in Prof Chang's laboratory at the School of Veterinary medicine and science (SVMS) from 15th April-15th July 2010. Each IDVF was worth &amp;pound;3500. The two visiting fellows worked on innate immunity to influenza viruses in skeletal muscle cells and generated proof of concept data which helped to obtain a PhD studentship jointly funded by the UoN and Pfizer Animal health. This research is near completion and a high impact research paper with joint authorship of the UK and Indian scientists will be submitted soon. 
? As a result of the contacts and network developed, we have recently been successful in obtaining funding for a Trilateral research in partnership award in influenza virus research&amp;quot; with partners from TAUVAS, India and Virginia-Maryland Regional college of Veterinary Medicine Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (USA). 
? Under the auspices of the BBSRC-India PA and UKIERI grant, an International conference on &amp;quot;Emerging and Transboundary Diseases of Global Importance&amp;quot; was organized during held during 15th to 16th July, 2013 and a post conference &amp;quot;Farmer's Meet&amp;quot; on the 7th July, 20 13 at Chennai, India.

Prof Chang and Dr Kuchipudi visited the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals during October 2012. Following extensive scientific meetings and discussions, a number of keys areas have been identified for strategic long-term research collaboration between both the organizations. A significant step towards furthering research collaboration is that, Dr Sanjeev Kumar, scientist working on avian influenza project at IAHVB has been offered a PhD project at SVMS in principle and will be starting a PhD with Prof Chang by September 2014. He will be jointly funded by the University of Nottingham (tuition fee) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) (living expenses).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>85AD7AA9-BC88-4AAD-B354-792A6F3B6235</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>During the period of the grant we have engaged with the following institutions in India through bilateral visits and research meetings
