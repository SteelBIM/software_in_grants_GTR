Abstract: This study explores the link between business model reconfiguration (BMR) by incumbent firms and organizational performance. We investigate this relation using regression analysis and unique survey data from a sample of 206 publicly-traded UK and US service firms. Although, across all our sample firms, BMR is not associated with superior performance, an inverted U-shaped relation is estimated between the scope of BMR and firm performance for firms which are also engaged in process/product innovation. These results contribute to the innovation and business model literatures by offering support to the view that innovative incumbents need to adopt BMR that is broad enough to maintain coherence among business model constituent elements, but not so broad to avoid the escalation of conjectured organizational costs.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint research work</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As part of a funded collaboration initiative between Bath University and TUM, my Bath colleague Professor Ammon Salter and I work jointly with TUM-based professor Oliver Alexy on a project using the dataset that has been created thanks to the ESRC-funded project.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation at Academy of Management Conference, Atlanta, USA, August 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AFE64D9D-41CB-459D-9B41-CFA5C1BBB3FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of paper &amp;quot; When Does Business Model Reconfiguration Create Value? &amp;quot; at the Academy of Management Conference, Atlanta, USA, August 2017</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MSc Teaching on &quot;Profiting from Innovation&quot; at the University of Bath School of Management</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>863305A8-7111-489D-ADCF-D51E2EE37CBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Incorporated published work and findings from the ESRC-funded project in the MSc course unit syllabus.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at the European Patent Office (EPO) on &quot;Protecting Intellectual Property in Business Model Innovation: Strategies for Innovating Incumbents and New Entrants&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>67C0613D-3A5A-4506-8D2C-4411485638D9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Gave a talk on &amp;quot;Protecting Intellectual Property in Business Model Innovation: Strategies for Innovating Incumbents and New Entrants&amp;quot; at a conference on Intellectual Property which was organized by/at the European Patent Office in Munich.

The first conference session will explore if and how the so-called &amp;quot;peculiarities&amp;quot; of services affect the ways in which firms use formal, contractual and strategic means to protect and capture value from their IP.

Summary of the article:&amp;quot;There is a growing consensus that the adoption of open innovation business models by firms contributes to
their innovation output and potentially their performance. However, as firms are becoming increasingly open and collaborate with horizontal and vertical partners, they are facing the challenges of protecting their intellectual property and of capturing value from innovation. Studies
have examined how formal and strategic appropriability mechanisms (e.g. patents, trademarks, design rights, secrecy, lead time advantages, complementary assets) influence the extent to which firms capture value from their innovation.
New research from Dr Panos Desyllas and colleagues delves further into this area, considering how the availability and use of different combinations of appropriability mechanisms are related to firms&amp;acute; collaboration activity, especially with different partners
and at different stages of the innovation process. In focussing on how this applies to knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms, their research has produced fresh insight&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bath-TUM Workshop, Munich</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B6CA2493-2785-4375-9326-1C56B37F8F19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop took place on September 14-15, 2015, at TUM Business School.

Desyllas, M. Miozzo, I. Miles and H. Lee. 

This study builds on the strategy literature on competitive advantage and a problem-solving perspective of value creation and capture to understand how firms' approaches to capturing value from innovation are interrelated with their broader competitive strategy. Comparing and contrasting IP management between cost- and differentiation-focused firms, we find that cost-focused firms perceive jointly all value appropriability mechanisms as being relatively more effective means of capturing value from innovation, compared with differentiation-focused firms. We also find that cost-focused firms perceive formal appropriability mechanisms as being relatively more effective means of capturing value from innovation relative to non-formal appropriability mechanisms, compared with differentiation-focused firms. Importantly, the relation between strategy and IP management holds even after controlling for previous explanations of IP protection choices on the basis of innovation- and industry-level factors. These results contribute to the literatures on value creation and capture by showing how IP management and the competitive strategy of firms are interrelated.

Output 2: &amp;quot;Innovation collaboration and appropriability by
knowledge-intensive business services firms&amp;quot;, M. Miozzo, P. Desyllas, H. Lee, I. Miles.

We uncover a &amp;quot;paradox of formal appropriability mechanisms&amp;quot; in the case of knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms. Despite evidence that KIBS firms do not typically consider formal appropriability mechanisms, such as patents, to be central mechanisms for capturing value from innovation, we show that they are nevertheless important for their innovation collaboration. We find a significant positive association between the importance of innovation collaboration and the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms. We interrogate the evidence for clients, as they are the most important partners for innovation collaboration. We find that the importance of innovation collaboration with clients goes hand-in-hand with the importance of formal appropriability mechanisms, although a negative relation appears when firms assign very high importance to formal appropriability mechanisms. Thus, modest levels of emphasis on formal appropriability mechanisms may prevent conflicts over ownership of jointly developed knowledge assets and knowledge leakages, while also avoiding the possibly negative effects of overly strict controls by legal departments on innovation collaboration. As well as exploring formal appropriability mechanisms, we also investigate the relationship between contractual and strategic appropriability mechanisms and innovation collaboration for KIBS firms.

Output 3: How much value is in business model reconfiguration? P. Desyllas, A. Salter, O. Alexy

This study contributes to research on business model innovation by exploring the links between business model reconfiguration (BMR) by incumbent firms and organizational performance. We conceptualize BMR as concurrent adjustments of multiple business model constituent elements, such as a firm's resources and competences, internal organization, relation to external stakeholders, and the nature of its value proposition (e.g. Gerasymenko 2015, Demil and Lecocq 2010). Our results suggest that the scope of BMR has important implications for incumbent firms' ability to improve performance after reconfiguring their business models. Although on average BMR is not associated with superior performance, we find that an inverted U-shaped association between the scope of BMR and firm performance holds for firms which are also engaged in process/product innovation. This result emphasises the benefits of modest BMR and suggest that, even though BMR should be carried out in a way that preserves coherence among the various business model constituent elements after BMR takes place, BMR can also have organizational cost implications that must be considered. Our results are also consistent with the view that there are complementarities between product/process innovation and BMR. These complementarities may reflect some superior innovation capacity of firms engaged in BMR to sense and seize new opportunities and deploy the requisite complementary assets. To the extent that new business models are directly linked to new products or processes, these more tangible forms of innovation may offer greater legitimacy and sense of direction among internal and external stakeholders. We also find that the introduction of radically new products/processes strengthens further the moderating role of product/process innovation, suggesting that there is a greater value creation potential waiting to be unlocked by BMR.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have implications regarding the development of a deeper understanding of innovation in services. The so-called &amp;quot;peculiarities of services&amp;quot; that set them apart from manufacturing, such as the intangible nature of their product, simultaneity of production and consumption, heterogeneity of outputs and importance of organizational factors in firm performance may even extend to the ways of appropriating the benefits of innovation. Some KIBS firms play central roles in innovation processes throughout the economy, as sources of innovations, agents of transfer and diffusion of knowledge, or innovation support for other sectors. Our results pave the way for a better understanding of both inter-organisational collaboration for innovation and the role of the functioning of the intellectual property rights system for KIBS firms.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DA167503-3A51-4165-A1F5-18A001D065F8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/management/faculty/panos-desyllas.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Innovation Caucus Member (Innovate UK &amp;amp; ESRC)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>98BE9316-38AA-493A-B742-5588BFAF7AB1</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://innovationcaucus.co.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an original survey sample of a maximum of 255 product and process innovations introduced by 167 publicly-traded British and American KIBS firms. The survey allowed us to explore firm-level characteristics which are not available from existing databases. This survey provides information on a firm's competitive strategy; the extent to which knowledge is codified, systematised and formalised; innovation collaboration activity during the creation and commercial exploitation of innovation, details about business model innovation activity etc. Drawing on these data, one can explore various possible links between competitive strategy, innovation collaboration and IP management. In addition, our study explores the perceived effectiveness of the full range of appropriability mechanisms, including formal appropriability methods (patents, trademarks, copyrights, design rights), contractual agreements used as behaviour enforcement mechanisms (employment contracts and confidentiality agreements), and strategic appropriability methods (secrecy, lead-time advantages, complexity, complementary assets). Most previous work only compares patents with secrecy.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0DB4C985-F81A-4BCA-A572-D2269FADEEBA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our study has been accepted for publication in a special section on &amp;quot;Patent Use&amp;quot; of the peer-reviewed academic journal Research Policy with guest editors Professors Ashish Arora (Duke University, USA) and Suma Athreye (Brunel University, UK).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Profiting from innovation in services</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AA2AD2F9-DB62-4C6C-AE49-5035DEA80536"><gtr:id>AA2AD2F9-DB62-4C6C-AE49-5035DEA80536</gtr:id><gtr:title>Innovation collaboration and appropriability by knowledge-intensive business services firms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/28008caf09273fc1d80239dba57b8595"><gtr:id>28008caf09273fc1d80239dba57b8595</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Marcela Miozzo</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7497A0BA-8D14-436B-A70B-435AD9D9DC75"><gtr:id>7497A0BA-8D14-436B-A70B-435AD9D9DC75</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of competitive strategy in capturing value from innovation in knowledge-intensive service firms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Management (Invited to Revise and Resubmit)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/006c447cf95e881f955441cf1a084134"><gtr:id>006c447cf95e881f955441cf1a084134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Panos Desyllas</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A4D390D7-C02B-4F6B-83F9-DFF55EC06222"><gtr:id>A4D390D7-C02B-4F6B-83F9-DFF55EC06222</gtr:id><gtr:title>Innovation collaboration and appropriability by knowledge-intensive business services firms</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/54cf9520c8042e762d3775fdf1830fc3"><gtr:id>54cf9520c8042e762d3775fdf1830fc3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Miozzo M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BFD829BD-5FE8-4BA0-ACE0-8FB74C8798FB"><gtr:id>BFD829BD-5FE8-4BA0-ACE0-8FB74C8798FB</gtr:id><gtr:title>How much value is in business model reconfiguration?</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/006c447cf95e881f955441cf1a084134"><gtr:id>006c447cf95e881f955441cf1a084134</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Panos Desyllas</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AF826197-4C91-42C4-9DD9-585EB8F52D7C"><gtr:id>AF826197-4C91-42C4-9DD9-585EB8F52D7C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Profiting from business model innovation: Evidence from Pay-As-You-Drive auto insurance</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research Policy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/330edac3ad951956172205471dcb0994"><gtr:id>330edac3ad951956172205471dcb0994</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Desyllas P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-3250</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I036559/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
