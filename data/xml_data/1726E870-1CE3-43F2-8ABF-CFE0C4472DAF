It investigates the aspirational dimension of Canadian middlebrow culture, using magazine writing on travel as a focus. The aims are to understand the role of magazines in circulating fantasies of cosmopolitanism and upward mobility, to explore exchanges between anglophone and francophone cultures in the pages of magazines, and to examine the self-conscious ways in which the magazines place themselves and their readers in relation to the social and cultural hierarchies.\n\nIn the earlier 20th century, Canadian literary and commercial discourses consistently highlighted Paris, London and New York as centres of culture and taste. Their desirability as travel destinations was enhanced by their combination of the exotic and the familiar; although culturally and linguistically intelligible places, they also focussed white Canadians' anxieties about their intimate yet vexed post/colonial relationships with America and Europe. The research explores the conflicted representation of European cities as centres of nostalgia and origin, on the one hand, and sites of urban sophistication, on the other. It also examines resonances with government-sponsored periodical advertising of Montreal as a city combining European flair with North American modernity.\n \nMore broadly, the project traces the magazines' strategies for recasting geographical mobility as a form of upward mobility, and for distinguishing leisure travel from the enforced movement of migration and diaspora. It investigates how foreign and domestic travel were marketed using competing narratives of modernity versus pristine natural beauty, and how the presentation of travel and foreignness was inflected by the consumerist and nationalist agendas which, to varying extents, shaped all the magazines included in our study. Finally, it tests the hypothesis that travel and its associated narratives actually enabled important cultural exchanges within Canada, as magazines became key sites for interaction across linguistic boundaries. \n\nThe method involves detailed study of advertisements, travel features and fictions of travel published between the 1920s and 1950s in La Revue Populaire, Chatelaine, Maclean's, the Canadian Home Journal, La Revue Moderne, Le Samedi, Saturday Night and Mayfair. Comparative readings will work along three axes: chronological (shifts over time), geographical (destinations represented), and cultural (francophone / anglophone magazines). The magazines will be considered in the context of broader developments in transatlantic middlebrow culture, and in relation to Canadian travel writing and fictions of travel published in book format during the same period. \n \nThe research begins in 1925, the year the word 'middlebrow' first appeared in print. The decade following WWI, a period of developing cultural nationalism, saw the establishment of several of the most important mainstream Canadian magazines, and the growth in circulation of existing titles. We will investigate exchanges of personnel, contributors and ideas among these magazines, and particularly across the language boundary. The study concludes in 1960, a point when the magazine market was undergoing significant transformation as middlebrow titles were merged, discontinued or reinvented in more popular formats. Our interpretations will be informed by an attention to the materiality of the page and an understanding of the practical imperatives of the periodical marketplace. The results of our research will resonate with current debates in Canada and the UK about the funding and subsidy of magazines and about language policy in relation to the press. The project arises from the AHRC Middlebrow Network, and will be conducted inpartnership with the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) and Library Archives Canada.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have designed our outputs to engage educators and students at secondary, FE and HE levels, as well as publishers, librarians, booksellers, and policy-makers concerned with publishing and language policies. Internationalism is a key element of our project's appeal to these groups: our partnerships with the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) and Library and Archives Canada (LAC) enable us to attract a diverse audience among the general public and to contribute substantially to intellectual exchange between the UK and Canada.\n\nOur comparative study of Francophone and Anglophone magazines will serve as a model for exploring relations between English and minority language periodicals (Welsh, Gaelic etc) in the UK. We take up the AHRC's emerging theme 'Translating Cultures' by investigating the role that print has played in Qu&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;cois nationalism, an issue that crosses international borders. The ongoing tensions between Qu&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;cois culture and the English-language majority of Canada, for instance, parallel Scotland's current concern with representing its distinctive culture in the media (cf 'Crisis in the Scottish Press Industry' White Paper).\n\nOur website, created in partnership with CWRC, will exemplify leading practice in visualising geo-spatial and chronological data, contributing to another AHRC emerging theme 'Digital Humanities'. Resources used to generate representations (e.g. mapping overlays and coordinate data) will be made available for reuse by other developers under an open source licence. Our electronic resource is also a test case for developing linked datasets, an emergent technology that allows urls to be created which automatically search databases with metadata in the public domain. Research Libraries UK and JISC have just announced their aim of making metadata about their collections available online, and both LAC and the British Library are currently interested in possible applications of linked data technologies. Our project wilvance co-operation among libraries, digital humanities specialists and literary researchers, working towards the shared goal of making our print heritage increasingly accessible. \n\nWe will promote our website through services such as Intute, the Research Information Network, and schoolnet.org.uk, by requesting links on resource pages at libraries and, importantly, by being included in CWRC's network of digital projects. We foresee our online resources appealing to a range of professionals, students, and authors/artists seeking insight into topics such as early 20th-century print culture, consumption and social hierarchies, tourism, and trans-Atlantic literary exchange. Investigations begun through the website can be followed up using our annotated bibliography and links to further resources, and through the planned publications.\n\nWe will make our work widely available through reputable presses, journals and international conferences. In order to draw attention to our outputs and stimulate debate, the applicant and RA will propose short co-authored articles to mainstream Canadian magazines, as our research on the history of particular titles will interest those still operating today (Chatelaine; Maclean's). We will also seek opportunities for broadcast or print interviews, building on the applicant's recent experience publicising her book, Sophistication. The success of the Middlebrow Network's international exchanges (via its website, conferences, and mailing list) demonstrate the appeal of our subject and its power to attract a wide audience of both academics and non-academics. The Times covered the 'Investigating the Middlebrow' conference, and the Network, which is led by the PI, has been discussed on websites and blogs created by non-academic readers. The mailing list includes librarians, archivists, publishers, magazine editors and journalists.

Focusing on the area of the Canadian periodical market which falls between 'little magazines' and mass-circulation pulps or tabloids, we investigated strategies used by advertisers, feature writers and fiction editors to present travel as a marker of distinction and cosmopolitanism. The project examines how periodicals usually associated with domesticity (e.g. Canadian Home Journal; La Revue Populaire) actually provided a vicarious experience of the foreign, but we also theorise that conservative middlebrow publications were concerned to render the foreign less threatening. They therefore favoured cities such as London, Paris and New York, which seemed to combine a sophistication unavailable in Canada with the familiarity derived from a common language and history.

We selected the six titles featured here because of the keen insights they can offer into the development of middlebrow culture. These particular periodicals were at their peak in the years 1925-60. This is not a coincidence; rather, we argue, the texts and tastes circulated via such periodicals were instrumental in constructing the middlebrow. Middlebrow culture is an especially exciting area of interdisciplinary study. The term dates back to 1925 when Punch defined middlebrows as 'people who are hoping that some day they will get used to the stuff they ought to like.' These days, cultural historians, scholars of print culture, and literary, film, art and music critics - many of whom have met and collaborated through the Middlebrow Network - are engaged in re-evaluating the institutions of middlebrow culture in the context of debates about taste, class, and self-improvement. Important discussions centre on whether 'middlebrow' can usefully refer to an area of cultural production, or only to audiences and reception practices. This contested term brings with it precisely the 'cultural baggage' which interests</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work is already being cited by numerous scholars working in periodical studies and Canadian studies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB526279-6665-4AD4-99F3-77DCA3872CD5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.middlebrowcanada.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of data from our project hosted by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory</gtr:description><gtr:id>9BFDBE9A-1CB2-4BDE-BE0E-AA95B6021B87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not known</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>CWRC collection</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://beta.cwrc.ca/project/magazines-travel-and-middlebrow-culture-canada-1925-1960</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>http://www.middlebrowcanada.org/
