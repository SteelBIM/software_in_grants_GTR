Research Centre (ERC) is an independent research centre which aims to provide trusted, robust and independent commentary on SME research and policy. ERC has six core research programmes focussing on entrepreneurial intentions, SME leadership, diversity, finance, innovation and business demographics. Each research programme aims to contribute to our understanding of SME growth and performance. Research methodologies vary between the different research programmes but draw on approaches from economics and econometrics, management science, sociology, geography and psychology. The work of the ERC has a strong comparative and international element.&lt;br />&lt;br />The ERC is a partnership between Warwick Business School, Aston Business School, Imperial College Business School, Strathclyde Business School, Birmingham Business School and De Montfort University. Funding is provided by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Department for Business, Innovation &amp;amp; Skills (BIS), the Technology Strategy Board (TSB) and, through the British Bankers Association (BBA), by the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, HSBC Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC and Lloyds TSB Bank PLC.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic growth is a key UK policy priority. SMEs play a potentially important role in national economic growth both in the short and longer term. The research undertaken by the ERC will provide a more robust, trustworthy and accessible evidence base upon which to make decisions, allocate resources and build effective SME policy. 

Our impact proposals aim to establish the ERC (and its on-line presence) as the reference point for SME growth and performance for policy makers, academics, firms and the media. At this point we envisage beneficiaries from the research and other activities of ERC will include:

Policy-makers and those involved in financing and supporting growing SMEs in the UK
Through the Stakeholder Mapping process we aim both to identify the needs of stakeholders but also to seek their input to shaping the ERC research programme. Where possible we will work with stakeholders throughout the funded period to ensure the relevance of the research being undertaken and maximize impact. We see some of the key UK stakeholders in this group being: BIS, regional agencies such as Scottish Enterprise and Invest NI, local business support organisations such as the LEPs and Chambers of Commerce, and more focused business support and advocacy organisations such as the British Bankers Association, British Venture Capital Association, UK Business Angels Association, the CBI, the FSB, the IFB, the IOD, the Institute for Family Business and the Women's Business Council. ERC would seek to work with these organisations on a bilateral basis wherever relevant and inform their activities through:

(a) A Response Group of senior ERC staff who will provide timely input for stakeholders on emerging policy issues and information requests relating to small business growth.
(b) Thematic White Papers, Policy Papers and Research Papers as well as on line and face to face seminars and workshops
(c) An annual State of Small Business in Britain report and associated Summit. 

The academic and practice community in the UK and elsewhere
ERC will provide a focal point for the UK SME research community, facilitating networking and maximizing potential synergies in research and knowledge transfer. ERC's work will also be of interest to policy makers internationally and organizations such as the EU, OECD, World Bank and EBRD which contribute to SME policy and support. ERC applicants have pre-existing links to many of these international organizations. Key mechanisms through which we will impact on the academic and practice communities will be:
(a) Working directly with practice and representative groups (e.g. FSB, IFB) to ensure our research informs their strategic thinking and to provide an input into their annual conference and workshop programme. 
(b) Academic papers and presentations in leading international journals and conferences
(c) By establishing a broadly based Associates Network of interested academics, firms, policy makers etc. 
(d) By establishing a content rich Knowledge Exchange series of thematic Communities of Interest 

Media
ERC aims to become the reference point for the UK media in relation to SME growth and performance. Centre staff will also work with the ESRC Press Office to maximise the Centre's public engagement. Publication of Centre White Papers and the State of Small Business in Britain reports will create regular media opportunities. We will also create a searchable Experts Database alongside the Associates Network described earlier. 

SMEs
Many ERC staff are directly engaged in business development activities through their teaching activities at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels and through mechanisms such as the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Programme, the EDA and the Warwick Business Growth Network. ERC research will contribute directly to inform the content of these and other related business development programmes. Programme alumni will be a source of case studies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4547611</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>2014- March
One of ERC's objectives is to generate major policy or practice impacts and in its second year, ERC can evidence doing this in a number of ways. A wide range of engagements have been undertaken and these are not exhaustively recorded in this report. They provide an opportunity for influencing thinking around the evidence base which is difficult to track via individuals and their organisations and may only be felt over the longer term. However, examples of engagement which is already yielding significant impacts (or might in years to come) are:
LEPS and Local Growth
The ERC has been actively involved in the local growth agenda on a number of fronts in the last year. June 2014 saw the launch of the LEP Growth Dashboard in collaboration with the GrowthAccelerator team in Grant Thornton. Its purpose is to provide each LEP with a set of simple metrics on the growth of existing firms and start-ups in the LEP area and set these alongside the key barriers to growth flagged by businesses who are seeking to grow and have become a participant in the Growth Accelerator programme. The Dashboard, based primarily on ONS data, can be used as a source of evidence to inform discussions on priorities in business support and includes easily understood metrics which can be readily updated on an annual basis. The LEP Growth Dashboard is now forming an important input into the discussions at LEP level into the focus of business support in the aftermath of the LEP Growth Deals landing in July 2014 and in particular the design of the Growth Hubs and associated business support spend under ESIF allocations from April 2015. We undertook a series of LEP workshops in October and November to disseminate the LEP Growth Dashboard, alongside the industrial sector clusters work developed by Hart and Danes on behalf of BIS, and develop the understanding of key personnel in the LEP network on the value of the Dashboard and what future metrics could be produced

The ERC research team are also working closely with the BIS Local Growth team to use the LEP Growth Dashboard framework to inform the shape and focus of the national level Local Growth Strategy. We provided updated and extended data for BIS and CLG in August 2014 and we are in active discussions on further data requirements at local economic area level. Much of this analysis informed our contributions to the FSB report on &amp;quot;A new design: making local support work for business&amp;quot;, which was launched in February 2015.
Business Support Evaluation
ERC has been involved in a number of discussions with BIS about assessing the impact of business support and in particular advising on how to arrive at a productivity-based evaluation framework. Our contribution built on the evidence provided to the All Party Parliamentary Small Business Group Inquiry on SMEs and Productivity in 2014 and which reported in February 2015 (written and oral evidence provided).
ERC researchers have been providing expertise to the design and implementation of quasi-experimental evaluation methodologies related to business support. This contribution concerns a number of RCTs related to new business support products and services in England. ERC has been involved in each of the three RCTs currently running in the UK, advising on the initial design of the BIS Growth Voucher programme and having on-going involvement with the other two RCTs - the Growth Impact Pilot and the University Growth Voucher programme run by a consortium of Small Business Charter Business Schools. Both programmes were launched in 2014.
ERC have been engaged with the What Works Centre on Local Growth in the context of business support to develop their work with the LEPs. We assisted in the development of an agenda for their meeting in Leeds (October 2014) with the LEPs and hosted by the Cabinet Office to discuss the appetite for experimentation in evaluation across the range of business advice interventions proposed in the SEPs and ESIF documents which go live for funding projects in April 2015. ERC provided the WWC with a spectrum of business advice interventions (from light touch information provision through diagnosis and brokerage to intensive business growth programmes) that could become a menu for LEPs to select from as they engage with this agenda. It is this menu that will provide the framework for the introduction of RCTs in this delivery space.
BIS Enterprise 2020
ERC were invited to participate in discussions about the development of the BIS Enterprise 2020 Strategy document. Participation in an initial 'sandpit' workshop in November 2014 with a range of government stakeholders led to a more detailed and focused follow-up discussion with ERC in January 2015 to ensure the policy discussions continue to be grounded in the evidence base as they are developed. In addition, ERC provided a rapid response to a BIS ED exercise on policy prioritisation. 2 of ERC's recommendations were subsequently taken forward in BIS' overall set of priorities. 

2015March to July 2015
? We have published two collaborative reports over this period. The innovation benchmarks report was launched with Enterprise Europe Network and the Growth Dashboard was a collaboration with the Business Growth Service. 
? We are undertaking the evaluation of the Birmingham Venturefest event which was held on the 30th June. ERC also participated in the event reporting on the Growth Dashboard and Innovation Benchmarks reports. 
? Stephen Roper and Katherine Hathaway did a presentation on ERC to the ESRC Council in May. This focussed very much on ERC's policy focus and impact and engagement activities. 
? We have been actively engaging with the banks over the last quarter in a series of meetings with Barclays, Lloyds and RBS. Mark Hart presented to Lloyds Board on the Growth Dashboard and M2000 companies and further presentations within Lloyds are planned. Mark Hart has also been working with Matt Smith (CEO, Office, Building and Commercial Banking, RBS) who is leading the REAP London project and has been assisting them with data issues regarding their focus on building a support offer for growth firms in London.
? We held a joint event with CDFA (the second of this type) examining the factors shaping the growth of micro-firms. This was well attended and led to some further interesting network opportunities with HMRC. 
August to October 2015
? ERC research was a central feature of two workshops organised by BIS. Results from the Sociology of Enterprise and an element of the work from the Ambition research theme were presented as part of a workshop on entrepreneurial mindsets. Research drawing on Theme 6 was presented at a workshop on productivity.
? ERC was invited by UKCES to contribute to its 'Masterclass' series. A presentation drawing on their productivity analysis was given by Jun Du and Karen Bonner (20th Nov 2015).
? ERC is working with the Pink Shoe Club to host a joint event (28th Nov) focussed on womens' enterprise. Mark Hart will share some results from the GEM project at this event and other ERC staff will contribute to panel discussions. 
? ERC have been invited to give a presentation to HMRC on small firms and innovation in December 2015. This is pleasing as it creates an opportunity to identify potential opportunities for further collaboration and data sharing. 
? ERC continues to be approached by different organisations to provide 'SME intelligence'. One recent example is an invitation from BIS to participate in a workshop on incubators and accelerators as a contribution to the development of a new policy paper. ERC data/evidence currently also supporting at least 3 CSR 2015 bids.
November 2015 to January 2016
Unlocking UK productivity - internationalisation and innovation in SMEs
The report makes the following main arguments:
? The UK has an opportunity to enhance its productivity. Whilst before 2008 productivity in the UK was on a strong upward trend, the UK's productivity performance has since weakened. Improving this has become a vital agenda for the UK government.
? SMEs have a key role to play in addressing this challenge: The SME contribution to the UK economy is significant. Boosting SME productivity growth can have a significant impact on UK productivity growth at large.
? The role of internationalisation and innovation in boosting SME productivity growth has been relatively underexplored. Evidence strongly indicates that those businesses that engage in international activity and innovation are more likely to enhance firm performance - including productivity growth. 
? It is estimated that between 9 and 12% of non-exporting firms within the UK could become exporters and just over half that do export could become persistent exporters. Together these two groups include more than 110,000 SMEs in the UK economy. If they are successfully encouraged to export or export persistently, an additional &amp;pound;1.15 billion Gross Value Added (GVA) could be added to the UK economy within the first year.
? Internationally active SMEs are three times more likely to introduce products or services that are new to their sector than those which are entirely domestic in orientation. Despite this positive relationship, however, only 1 in 5 employer SMEs are exporters.
? The limited engagement by SMEs in internationalisation and innovation can be
explained, in part, by SMEs' low growth ambition: UK SMEs are demonstrated to be less 'growth inclined' and ambitious than other G8 economies. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor alone has pointed to a 17% growth aspiration in the UK among entrepreneurs vs 27% in the US. 
Profiling job growth in 2015
The key points emphasised:
? Employer enterprises - those with at least one employee, including all businesses from start-ups through to large multinationals - created or added a total of 2.52 million jobs. This was offset by enterprises contracting or going out of business altogether, which saw 1.83 million jobs lost, giving a net job creation figure for the UK SME sector of 695,500.
? Of the new jobs added, 1.5 million were created by existing companies expanding. In addition, a record number of start-up firms added a further 1 million. This took the total number of private sector employees to a record 20.3 million.
? The figures on UK companies show that 299,591 firms were 'born' in 2014-15. This was the highest number of start-up 'births' in a single year since comparable records began in 1997.
? The total number of employer enterprises across the UK rose to just under 1.8 million, also a record. These firms account for approximately one third of all businesses in the UK, the remaining two-thirds (3.6 million) including the self-employed, partnerships and enterprises with zero employees.
Other Impact Activities
? ERC presented material from the Innovation in Legal Services projects at two workshops organised by the Legal Services Board and the Law Society in November 2015. 
? ERC partnered with the Department of Trade and Investment (NI) to hold a workshop focussing on 'Innovation in micro-businesses evidence and policy support' in Belfast in November 2015. 
? ERC were invited to present a summary of current research evidence to the Business Taxation team in HMRC in December 2015. This part of an on-going dialogue with HMRC which we hope will develop into a future collaborative project (on exporting and productivity) and dialogue around Growth Hubs.
? ERC together with ISBE (Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship) held a meeting to discuss building a range of research led activities which promote SME growth through university/SME engagement. This recognised the transition of the Community of Interest into an ISBE Special Interest Group. Contacts at the meeting led to the opportunity to meet with Business Wales in January. 
? ERC partnered with UKTI in a November event organised by Warwick Business School to present research results relating to mid-sized businesses. A further series of events are planned for March - June 2016. 
? Sara Carter was appointed as a member of the International Scientific Advisory Board, Center for Agricultural Business Management, Swedish University of Agricultural Science.
? Sara Carter also delivered a 'Distinguished Professorial Address' 'Does Entrepreneurship Make You Wealthy?' University of West of England, October 2015.
? ERC's Michael Anyadike-Danes has accepted an appointment onto the Microbusiness Research Portal Advisory Board comprising a range of experts from across government, academia and private sector. The Microbusiness Research Portal is being launched as part of a partnership between the ONS (Office for National Statistics), the University of St Andrews and Middlesex University, with the active support of BIS to provide a powerful source of research evidence for policy-makers and practitioners as well a unique academic research resource for those interested in the characteristics, drivers, growth and development of microbusiness.
? Recent PR work to support the launch of Unlocking UK productivity - internationalisation and innovation in SMEs was significantly affected by the news of the attacks in Paris. The pre-Christmas work on the latest business population data was more successful including radio and press coverage. Future plans are being prepared for the forthcoming M2000 Report and Jun Du's report on Productivity as well as on the latest high growth firms data.
? ERC continues to be approached by different organisations to provide 'SME intelligence'. One recent example is an invitation from BIS to participate in a workshop on incubators and accelerators as a contribution to the development of a new policy paper. 

2016
Our Annual State of Small Business Britain conference was held on 30 November 2016 at the Shard, and we received very positive stakeholder feedback on the event. The Conference was co-hosted this year with Goldman-Sachs. We released the 2016 edition of our UK Local Growth Dashboard at the conference, which was picked up by the BBC in their afternoon news bulletins. More information about the Conference is included in section 4.1 below, and an evaluation report is included with the meeting papers.

ERC has been involved in the development and running of two data user groups over recent months. 
The Longitudinal Small Business Survey (LSBS) User Group held its first meeting at the ISBE conference in 2015 and an update session at the 2016 ISBE conference in October. ERC ran a competition for small research grants supported by BEIS in Spring 2016 focusing on the first wave of the LSBS and five projects were supported. Reports from these projects either have been or will be published by ERC as research papers.
The UK Innovation Survey (UKIS) User Group held its first meeting on July 7th 2016 at BEIS. Initial results from the UKIS 2015 were presented alongside some academic research. A further meeting will take place on March 21st also at BEIS which will be a further opportunity to share research and policy papers based on the UKIS.

ERC held a Brexit Summit meeting with the British Business Bank at The Shard in September, focusing on the theme of 'Sustaining &amp;amp; Developing SME Growth in a Period of Uncertainty'. The event was attended by over 20 senior policy makers.

A second ERC-HMRC workshop to discuss how ERC might provide analysis and insights on SME growth was held at The Shard in November 2016, which also involved representatives from BEIS and DIT.

The ERC hosted and took part in the Cities and Local Growth Policy Teams' Away Day, which was held at The Shard on Thursday 12th January. Stephen Roper and Mark Hart presented ERC research on innovation and SME growth, and took part in stimulating discussion with the policy teams on the themes of the Government's new Industrial Strategy and place. The Cities and local Growth Unit have indicated they would like a further workshop to discuss ERC insights on the Industrial Strategy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BEF1CC97-3C54-433B-93C8-9C40772EB39A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceu</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>2014-March 2015
Research activities
ERC research is divided into six themes each with a Professorial theme lead. Reflecting the geographically dispersed nature of ERC, the theme leads (and their research teams) are spread across the five partner institutions. Each theme has a strong relationship to SME policy and business support and examples of engagement are also provided. A number of these are described in more detail in the 'Major Impacts' section. 
Ambition and growth 
This work package analyses the drivers and barriers to growth in SMEs by exploiting existing data on entrepreneurial growth ambition and realised growth. Insufficient research on contextual influences is also a big gap in the understanding of entrepreneurial growth and so empirical work in this theme explores both contextual, firm and individual-level drivers and barriers to entrepreneurial firm growth drawing upon the existing work within the GEDI international project. This research theme is led by Prof Jonathan Levie.
Over the last year research has focussed on the determinants of ambition itself using international comparative data and the relationship between ambition and mobility. Entrepreneurial ambition and growth - an international comparison (Project 1.3) has used globally harmonised GEM data to examine direct and cross-level effects of several higher-level influences on high-ambition entrepreneurship and test multi-level theories. Key findings have been :
? The quality of institutions exercises a substantial influence on both formal and informal entrepreneurship. One standard deviation increase in the quality of economic and political institutions could double the rates of formal entrepreneurship and halve the rates of informal entrepreneurship.
? Peer attitudes significantly influence engagement in entrepreneurship
? Entrepreneurs' strategic predisposition, notably 'innovation' and 'internationalization' orientation, are important determinants of their growth aspirations
? Owner-manager team size is strongly associated with indicators of potential economic contribution of early-stage and established ventures, including growth ambition. 

Work on entrepreneurial ambition (Project 1.3) examines the effect of regional, local, peer-group, firm-level, and individual-level factors that influence both the propensity to engage in ambitious entrepreneurship and to achieve rapid realised growth. Use is being made of the UK Global Entrepreneurship Monitor database of around 200,000 individuals, the Business Structure Database (BSD) which contains information on all HMRC registered businesses, and a three year follow-up study of 1,250 UK SMEs. Jonathan Levie and Mark Hart are also analysing the relationship between gender, exporting and ambition across the business cycle. Jonathan Levie and Karen Bonner are analysing data on a 3 year follow-up of ambition and growth among 1,250 UK SMEs: the first time a longitudinal analysis of ambition and realised growth has been conducted in the UK. Results from the analysis of the ambition were presented at the ERC June policy conference with initial results on exporting presented at ISBE in November 2014 . 
In terms of ambition and mobility in the UK the key questions considered are whether migrants or veteran UK residents more likely to engage in high aspiration entrepreneurship . This then raises the additional question of whether it is ethnicity, mobility or other factors which matter in shaping ambition. Using data from the GEM study it is clear that:
? Both immigrants and regional migrants are more likely to be engaged in high ambition entrepreneurship 
? Human capital dominates other potential influences on migration and ambitious entrepreneurship. 
? Ethnicity matters for growth ambitions and has an effect which is clearly additional to that of migration. Moving to an area which is rich in human capital enhances the growth aspirations of regional migrants (but has no impact on immigrants). For immigrants it is knowing other entrepreneurs which is important. 
A project on 'Identifying bottlenecks in UK Systems of Entrepreneurship' was completed in July 2014 (Project 1.4). This project adopted a systemic perspective to the study of contextually embedded entrepreneurial growth processes to identify bottlenecks in regional entrepreneurship ecosystems. Two approaches were followed. The first, in Scotland, combined secondary analysis of data with a stakeholder engagement approach. The second, across all Government Office Regions of the UK, focused on secondary analysis only. Key findings were :
? By working collectively Scotland can accelerate the performance of innovation-driven entrepreneurial businesses for the benefit of both society and the Scottish economy
? The environment created by the local economic infrastructure, resources and societal attitudes toward entrepreneurship is key to the success of entrepreneurs in a given region
? Entrepreneurship in the UK will be given the biggest boost by unlocking an 'aspiration premium' in UK regions outside of London

Leadership and growth
While business growth is a driver of macroeconomic growth and is thus deemed desirable from a societal point of view, for the entrepreneur, the decision to grow is not necessarily a straightforward one. This research theme addresses two main issues: (i) the relationship between entrepreneurial cognition and growth intentions; and (ii) the relationship between entrepreneurial cognition, growth intentions, and capability creation and development. This research theme is led by Prof Andy Lockett and Professor James Hayton. 
Based on matched data from 500 SME and related financial information, analysis to date has focussed on the determinants of 'ambidexterity' the ability of firms to combine capabilities associated with exploration and exploitation (Project 2.2). The key research question has been: how do the antecedents of exploration and exploitation capabilities differ? Key results are :
? There is strong evidence of the differential drivers of exploration capabilities and exploitation capabilities with potentially conflicting outcomes;
? Top management team diversity has opposing effects increasing exploration capabilities but reducing exploitation capabilities;
? Vision has a positive effect on exploitation capabilities but a more limited effect on exploration capabilities. 
? R&amp;amp;D intensity has a positive effect on exploration but a negative effect on exploitation capabilities. 
? Continuous improvement has positive effects on both areas of capability development. 
Other work in this theme has focussed on the role of managerial and leadership skills in shaping the strategic behaviour and growth of small companies. This is described in detail in the additional projects section below. 
Diversity and growth 
Attempts to increase the participation rates of under-represented groups in enterprise and to increase the growth rates and ambitions of their entrepreneurial ventures have to date resulted in only modest changes. Why is this? This research theme explores the drivers and barriers to business development and growth among diverse social groups with a focus on the inter-relationship between individuals' entrepreneurial decision making and their household context. The activity draws on the innovative Enterprise Diversity Alliance (EDA) to develop productive relationships between the finance sector and businesses from under-represented groups, and enhance the support available for such enterprises. This research theme is led by Prof Sara Carter with Prof Monder Ram, Prof Kiran Trehan and Dr Sam Mwaura.
Existing datasets contain important insights on under-represented groups but have yet to be fully analysed. Project 3.2 examines two main datasets: the SME Finance Monitor and the Wealth &amp;amp; Assets Survey, to develop our understanding of diversity and enterprise. Outputs from both elements of this project are now completed . New data collection is being undertaken through a series thirty case studies of business households in Glasgow and Birmingham (Project 3.3). Fieldwork for this commenced in January 2015, with field work completion expected by May 2015. Analysis and findings will be reported in a Research Paper, expected Autumn 2015. This builds on previous work in this area . 
The final area of activity in the diversity stream is Mapping and Activating Support for Diverse Business Networks through the EDA - An Agenda for Action Research (Project 3.4). This project entails mapping the business support networks of ethnic minority businesses in three UK cities with contrasting demographic profiles in respect of diversity (Birmingham, Glasgow and Norwich). Over the last quarter, the project team have commenced the data collection process. The 20 interviews required for the city of Birmingham have been completed. The interviews for the other 2 cities (Glasgow and Norwich) are currently underway. An initial theoretical paper has been submitted for publication . 
Finance and Growth 
Access to finance provides both a potential driver and a barrier to growth for SMEs. This research theme takes as its departure point that insufficient recognition has been given to the notion that different types of finance may be appropriate for different types of SME at different points in time, with different types of growth. The theme is led by Prof Mike Wright with Dr Stuart Fraser. 
Work on the impact of finance on different measures of growth including sales, employment, value added, etc. (Project 4.2) and the impact of family ownership and board structure continues (Project 4.6) . So far quantitative analysis has focused on examining the drivers of why family firms go into administration compared with non-family firms as well as changes in employment and sales. Qualitative analysis has also examined how finance and governance mechanisms contribute to the ability to grow and growth through different types of innovation . 
Research on the impact of finance on management buyouts and buyins is also continuing and has examined failure and growth in PE backed buyouts and is also looking at the role of PE backed LBOs in removing financing constraints, especially for buyouts of private firms, to enable them to patent more (Project 4.7). Related work on spin-outs from universities is also continuing but so far the analysis has analysed the influences of internal university aspects on inter alia accessing finance for growth and on differences between spin-outs in the UK, Italy in Norway with respect to the drivers of their ability to access venture capital finance (Project 4.8) .
The role of finance in explaining firm survival/growth (financial constraints) - Project 4.3 - examines the causal relationships between finance gaps (resulting, for example, from financial rejection and discouragement) and firm survival/growth. Analysis using UKSMEF data (2004-2009) indicates there were significant financial constraints on survival/growth, especially due to a lack of working capital, following the financial crisis in 2008. Discouragement is also linked with a lower likelihood of survival and firm growth; this is consistent with evidence that businesses tend to over-estimate the likelihood of rejection (resulting in the business being under-capitalised) . Related work on discouragement was published in early 2014 (before the current reporting period) but related work on the group of discouraged non-borrowers continues. 
The final project in the finance stream relates to implied default risk and the determinants of bank lending decisions - Project 4.5.This project is about providing policy makers with a better understanding of the determinants of bank lending decisions. How is this related to banks' perceptions of default risk? Adopting a structural approach allows the effects of lender risk aversion to be disentangled from the effects of borrower risk on bank lending decisions. The research (which is at an early stage) involves developing a model of the default risk distribution implied by the likelihood of financial rejection. One reason why this model is useful is because it provides an indication of finance providers' risk perceptions and sensitivity to risk (based on actual funding decisions). Initial empirical analysis with the model using UKSMEF data (2004-2009) suggests there was a significant upward shift in the implied default risk distribution following the financial crisis pointing to increased risk perceptions (and explaining around one-half of the increase in the likelihood of rejection following the financial crisis). At the same time there was a tightening of risk thresholds, given risk perceptions, pointing to increased risk aversion (and explaining the other half of the increase in the rejection likelihood). 
Innovation, exporting and growth
A number of studies emphasise a positive link between innovation and business performance, while other studies have stressed synergies between innovation and exports. This work package focuses on the relationships between innovation, exporting and growth in SMEs. Theme lead is Professor Jim Love (Warwick). 

Research during 2014 and 2015 aims to link knowledge acquisition and generation by firms to their innovation and value creation. The initial step is to explore how knowledge from different sources influences innovation and exporting in SMEs (Project 5.2). How do ambient local knowledge, innovation linkages and learning-by-exporting contribute to innovation in SMEs? Key findings are :
? There is strong and consistent support for complementarity between non-interactive and interactive knowledge connections across firms in all sectors and size-bands.
? Both interactive and non-interactive search have positive effects on innovation, with stronger effects for SMEs than large firms.
? Other elements of the 'innovation eco-system' have little effect on innovation in SMEs i.e. there is little disadvantage in being in an area with little knowledge 'richness'.

What are the key drivers and barriers of enhanced innovation and exports in SMEs? (Project 5.3) What factors influence SME's ability to successfully exploit new innovations in export markets? Key findings for UK SMEs:
? Innovation is a key attribute differentiating 'intermittent' and 'persistent' SME exporters.
? Previous international experience, innovation and exporting early in the lifecycle are both positively associated with breadth of export markets for SMEs.
Work is also underway in association with Bettina Becker (Aston) to develop a comparative analysis of the determinants of innovation in the UK and Spain - economies which have very different levels of regulation .
Business demography and growth 
This research theme focuses on the dynamics of business demography. The central focus is to build understanding of the growth rate distribution of UK businesses and which types of firms are responsible for job creation and economic growth. This theme is led by Professor Mark Hart with support from Michael Anyadike-Danes. There are a number of elements to the on-going work on firm dynamics and job creation (Project 6.2):
1. UK work leading focusing on the importance of age rather than size in understanding the process of job creation
2. Work on the LEP network in England which has led to collaborative work with Grant Thornton/Growth Accelerator and the publication of the LEP Growth Dashboard in June 2014. Further work for the BBIS Local Growth team on more LEP enterprise metrics (August 2014).
3. International comparative cohort work on the size effects on job growth.
4. Up-dating the job creation and destruction analysis for the UK incorporating 2014 data - completed January 2015.
Related outputs include both ERC papers and forthcoming journal papers . 
Other aspects of the work on business demographics include participation in the OECD Dynemp V2 project by Michael Anyadike-Danes and a focus on the r0ole of policies on explaining international differences in the degree to which small start-ups are able to upscale if successful; the number of firms that experience fast employment growth; the shape of the employment growth distribution; the volatility of employment growth over time of comparable groups of firms; the 'secular decline in entrepreneurship and churning rates; the resilience of firms to the 'Great Recession' of 2008; and, the contribution of high-tech firms to employment growth. Allied to this is the on-going development of the linked longitudinal database based on ONS population and business surveys which now incorporates data from a range of government business support schemes in three broad categories - business advice; exporting and innovation (Project 6.3). 
Research on SME productivity also continues to identify the contributions of different types of heterogeneous firms to aggregate labour productivity growth (ALPG). ALPG decompositions - into average productivity growth, resource allocation, dynamic components: survivors, entrants and exits - will also be explored (Project 6.4). The objective is to profile and create a typology of UK firms' productivity changes and to investigate the ALPG contributions of heterogeneous firms as well as the role of firm size and age.
Additional Projects
Three additional projects commissioned prior to March 2013 continued into this period of activity. These were: 
Management &amp;amp; Leadership Skills/Practices in SMEs (August 2013 to February 2015, BIS, &amp;pound;106k)
This project is being led by Prof James Hayton with support from Prof Andy Lockett and Prof Deniz Ucbasaran. The aims of the project were to expand knowledge of the nature and extent of deficiencies in leadership and management skills amongst UK SMEs with the ultimate objective being to develop a systematic approach for measuring leadership and management skills in SMEs and if possible, explore and develop a composite measure of management and leadership skills that can be used in further analysis. Results from this project were published as Hayton, J (2015) 'Leadership and management skills in SMEs: measuring associations with management practices and performance', BIS research paper No. 211. March 2015. 
Entrepreneurial Leadership - PhD Studentship (Oct 2013-Sept 2016, &amp;pound;54k)
This new three-year PhD studentship funding Elini Kesidou focuses on entrepreneurial leadership and the connections between entrepreneurial leadership and organizational performance. The lead supervisor is Professor Sara Carter. The studentship is co-funded by Scottish Enterprise and the Hunter Centre for Entrepreneurship at Strathclyde Business School. 

This PhD studentship will focus on high growth companies in Scotland in order to gain a greater understanding of: the characteristics of leadership; whether developed leadership skills have an effect on company performance; the type of business support received from public agencies; and whether and in what ways business support helps business performance. 

The Rewards of Entrepreneurship - Constructing Economic Wellbeing within Entrepreneurial Households - PhD Studentship (Oct 2013-Sept 2016, &amp;pound;54k)
This new three-year PhD studentship funding Johan de Borst focuses on a household perspective on the rewards to entrepreneurship. The studentship is being funded by Strathclyde Business School and the lead supervisor is Professor Sara Carter with Professor Jonathan Levie. The studentship will extend work in Theme 3 (Diversity) by exploring how entrepreneurial households construct economic wellbeing despite uncertain and irregular rewards, and will link with Theme 1 (Ambition) by exploring the potential impact of entrepreneurial households in their support or curtailment of business growth ambitions. 

Four other additional commissioned projects commenced during the current period. These were:
Sociology of Enterprise - April 2014 to Feb 2015
This project for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) undertakes a critical analysis of how institutional factors and the wider political and historical contexts shape entrepreneurial disposition (growth-orientation) and small business management. This qualitative research project, under the direction of Prof Mark Hart, will include researchers from Aston Business School, Policy Research Group (Durham University) and Dr Sally Jones (Leeds University) and will involve 100 face-to-face interviews. Led by Mark Hart on behalf of BIS - interviews with 100 SME business owners are scheduled to complete at the beginning of February. Preliminary findings were presented at the BIS Small Business Research Conference on 3rd March.
Nation of Angels - Business angels project - July 2014-January 2015
Led by Mark Hart and Mike Wright this project was undertaken for the UK Business Angels Association and the Centre for Entrepreneurs. Qualitative interviewing and the UKs largest a survey of business angels provided information on the scale and success factors of UK business angel investments. The final report for this project was presented at the UKBAA's Winter Forum end January 2015 (http://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/ERC-Angels-Reportpdf). 
 SME-university interaction (January to April 2015)
Led by Stephen Roper and Karen Bonner (working with Nola Hewitt-Dundas, Queens) this project is being funded by HEFCE. It will provide a profile of SMEs in local areas in England. The aim is to provide an information resource for higher education institutions about the potential for developing links with local SMEs and the types of demands for services which might exist. Initial results from this project are due to be published by HEFCE in April/May 2015. 
 Innovation in legal services (September to April 2015)
Led by Stephen Roper and Jim Love this project is being undertaken for the Solicitors Regulation Authority and the Legal Services Board. Almost nothing is known about innovation in this sector and so the project aims to explore the extent and nature of innovation activity in Legal Services. 
Publications:
Between March 2014 and March 2015 ERC published 12 additional research papers intended for an academic audience (Annex A). 40research papers were also published in leading management and entrepreneurship journals including Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, Journal of Business Venturing, Research Policy, Small Business Economics, Strategic Management Journal, Academy of Management, and the International Journal of Small Business (Annex B). Many of these papers were in collaboration with ERC Research Associates. 

ERC were represented at most of the major national and international entrepreneurship and management conferences and contributed significantly to the ISBE conference in Manchester in November 2014. ERC staff presented a number of papers at the conference with the paper by Alex Kevill, Kiran Trehan and Mark Easterby-Smith 'Gazing at my Reflection: Owner-Managerial Self-Concept and Dynamic Capabilities' winning a best paper in its track. The paper by Michael Anyadike-Danes and Mark Hart 'All Grown Up? The Fate after 15 years of the Quarter of a Million UK Firms Born in 1998' was also nominated for a track prize. ERC staff (Roper, Mole) also chaired a track at ISBE and Prof Stephen Roper also chaired a conference track on 'Business Growth and Policy' which focused on SME growth and growth-oriented SME policy and presented a masterclass on 'Impact by design'. 

ERC also held its first policy and research conferences during this period. The policy conference on the 'State of Small Business Britain' was held in Liverpool during June as part of the International Festival of Business and attracted a largely policy related audience of around 120 people. Presentations and video material focused on an attractive presentation of ERC research around high growth, exporting and finance and were mixed with live case studies from high growth business owners and panel discussions. A departure in both style and content for ERC, feedback from the conference was very positive and it is planned to repeat the event in June 2015 in Birmingham. Video material produced for the conference has been used extensively (for example at each of the LEP workshops) since the event and has proved a very worthwhile investment.

ERC's first research conference - 'Understanding small business growth' - was held in Birmingham in February 2015 and attracted an audience of academics and largely public sector analysts. Presentations from each of the ERC research themes were accompanied by presentations from leading international scholars and l UK scholars in related areas. Feedback from the event was again very positive with an appreciation both of the quality of the ERC research being showcased as well as the quality of the group of international visitors. Presentations from the event are all available on the ERC website at: http://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/understanding-small-business-growth-2015. 

March to July 2015
Key ERC publications during this period included the 'Growth Dashboard for 2015' which again highlighted the complexity of the business growth profile of England and the 'Innovation Geography' report which provide the first overview of which UK localities are most innovative.
ERC has published five new research papers since March 2015. 
? In 'Does Entrepreneurship make you wealthy?' Sara Carter and Samuel Mwaura examine whether being an entrepreneur is always beneficial in terms of wealth. Their analysis suggests the answer is a definite 'maybe'. If you start from one of the upper deciles of the income distribution then entrepreneurship will significantly enhance your wealth; if you start in the lowest deciles however the results are less positive. The research findings cast doubt on the value of entrepreneurship as a response to social deprivation or inequality. 
? A paper by Mike Wright and Helmut Fryges provides a new perspective on university spin-out companies, suggesting an interesting new typology. The paper, developed as part of a collection of papers on spin-outs, provides an introduction to this research area and develops an agenda for further research. 
? Exporting is the focus of a third research paper: 'Experience, age and exporting performance in UK SMEs'. This paper emphasises the positive exporting effects which result from 'grafted knowledge' - acquired by the recruitment of management with prior international experience. Innovation also has positive exporting effects with more radical new-to-the-industry innovation most strongly linked to inter-regional exports; new-to-the-firm innovation is more strongly linked to intra-regional trade. Early internationalisation is also linked positively to the number of countries to which firms export and the intensity of their export activity. There is no evidence, however, relating early internationalisation to extra-regional exporting providing further evidence that firms tend be 'born regional' rather than 'born global'. 
? The first (RP 27) links firms' innovation objectives to their innovation strategies while two more recent papers relate innovation to other aspects of organisational and managerial change. Quality improvement methods are shown to generate significant short-term disruption but longer-term beneficial innovation effects (RP 30). Advanced manufacturing technologies - e.g. robotics, CIM - generate similar effects (RP 31).
? Finally, in March 2015 we also published a feasibility study examining the longer-term effects of Business Link support to SMEs in 2003 (RP 30). Based on matched survey and longitudinal data the project emphasises the value of longitudinal data in evaluation. 

August to October 2015
Growth dispositions exposed 
This commissioned project undertaken for BIS. The study uses perspectives from social theory to examine the dispositions of entrepreneurs towards growth. The findings show that there is a spectrum of dispositions towards growth among small business owners and these are influenced by demographics (gender, socio-economic status, etc.), family background, education, cultural norms and the scale and nature of international links. Within the spectrum, there are 3 broad identifiable categories of business owners: the growth-inclined, growth-ambivalent and growth-resistant. Businesses run by growth-inclined owners tend to perform better than those run by growth-ambivalent, and these in turn perform better than businesses run by growth-resistant owners. The results have implications for the targeting and design of business support services.
The drivers of productivity
Research provides new insight into the relationship between growth and productivity in UK firms. It also emphasises the sources of the UK productivity puzzle and the weakness of productivity growth among the UK's existing firms. A key finding from the report is the identification of a group of firms - the growth heroes - who achieve both scale-up and productivity growth. These 4-5 per cent of firms are responsible for around a fifth of all productivity increase in the UK. Initial results from this study have been presented as part of a productivity workshop at Aston and more recently at a UKCES Productivity Masterclass. 
Profiling UK spin-outs 
ERC has recently published the results of a comprehensive survey of UK university spin-out (USOs) businesses. The study covers how these businesses were formed, the financial and business support received, the business models they pursue, characteristics of the founding teams, intellectual property strategies etc. 
Illustrative findings are:
? On average there is a two year time lag between development of the technology on which the business is based and the spin-out being formed. For a third of USOs this time lag is shorter at just under a year between technology development and commercialisation. 
? A fifth of USOs develop technology that they then seek to further develop and commercialise in collaboration with other organisations, typically incumbent businesses. Only 14 per cent of USOs were engaged solely in providing consultancy or contract research activities. 
? The average USO generates &amp;pound;190,000 in sales and as might be expected, older businesses have higher levels of sales. A significant share (almost a third) of USOs were not generating revenue at the time of our survey. These are not newly established businesses, as might be anticipated, but rather businesses that have existed for on average of 7 years, and are focused on selling their technology. 
? USOs are generating around half of their revenue from non-UK markets. This share is higher for Northern Ireland and Scottish USOs with no significant relationship found between the USO age and the share of sales to export (non-UK) markets. 
? On average USOs employ 4 highly educated employees, with almost all (93 per cent) having a degree level qualification or higher. Employment growth in USOs is very mixed with gains in some being counteracted by losses in others since 2011. There is no straight-forward explanation for this with sales growth/losses not related to the age of the USO, the business model adopted or share of export sales. 
? The majority of USOs have a founding team typically comprising 3 individuals, with only 12.5 per cent being established by only one founder. 
? Average investment varies significantly according to the business model of the USO. Consultancy based USOs require the lowest level of financial investment at c. &amp;pound;0.8m. This contrasts with USOs formed to develop technology with a view to alliances with other businesses, where average investment was &amp;pound;3.9m. 
Grafting knowledge for SME exporting 
SMEs and particularly small firms often cite a lack of market knowledge as a barrier to entering export markets and as a barrier to more persistent exporting. Recent ERC analysis of UKTI survey data has examined the determinants of SME exporting. 
This makes clear the role of a firm's age and its international experience in terms of export reach but also highlights the potential value of 'grafted knowledge' through the recruitment of managers with prior international experience. A number of factors are linked to SMEs' exporting reach (i.e. the number of countries to which they export) and intensity:
? International experience has positive effects on export reach and intensity. Firm age has negative effects.
? Innovation also has positive exporting effects with more radical new-to-the-industry innovation most strongly linked to inter-regional exports; new-to-the-firm innovation is more strongly linked to intra-regional trade. 
? Early internationalisation is also linked positively to the number of countries to which firms export and the intensity of their export activity
Positive exporting effects also result from grafted knowledge - acquired by the recruitment of management with prior international experience. Specifically, having managers with prior international experience increases firms' probability of exporting to 6-10 countries by 4.15 per cent, the probability of exporting to four global regions by 2.38 per cent, and of earning 16-25 per cent of sales from exports by 2.86 per cent. 
The implication is that grafted knowledge can be an important supplement to firms' experience in shaping the extent and intensity of firms' export activity. This suggests the potential value of 'export mentoring' and advisory services to support new exporters and firms during the early years of their exporting journey. 
Family ownership and innovation in micro-firms 
Schumpeterian arguments related to creative destruction place small, entrepreneurial firms at the centre of the innovation process. The exclusion of micro-enterprises (with less than 10 employees) from most innovation surveys means that we know relatively little about innovation among this group of firms. Our analysis suggests - rather unexpectedly - that family owned firms are more likely than other small firms to introduce new to the market innovations. 
New ERC research explores the determinants of new-to-the-market innovation, the basis for the Schumpeterian creative destruction process in micro-firms using new survey data for 1,000 UK micro-firms. The results suggest: 
? Strong support for the interactive nature of micro-enterprise innovation and suggest the value of open innovation for this group of firms;
? Firms internal resources such as skills, R&amp;amp;D investment and policy support also prove important;
Our results also suggest that family-owned firms are more likely to introduce new-to-the-market innovations. Specifically, family owned firms are 8 per cent more likely to introduce new to the market innovations than comparable firms which are not family owned. 
It is widely recognised that family businesses face rather particular issues in their growth and development. Our research suggests that helping these firms overcome these issues may have significant and unanticipated benefits in terms of innovation.
November 2015 to January 2016
Unlocking UK productivity - internationalisation and innovation in SMEs
Published jointly with Goldman Sachs and the British Business Bank this report provides an overview of the UK productivity challenge and the role of SMEs in addressing this challenge. It provides an integrated summary of some of the key elements of ERC research over the last three years pulling together the evidence on high growth in the UK and the importance of innovation and early internationalisation. Written by Mark Hart, the report was widely covered in the UK press.
Profiling job growth in 2015
New analysis of job creation in 2015 was published by ERC in December based on work by Mark Hart, Karen Bonner and Michael Anyadike-Danes. Based on data provided by the ONS and made available through the Secure Data Service, the analysis was covered in the Financial Times and the BBC Today programme and picked up by a number of other media outlets as well as Le Monde in France (their equivalent of the Economist). The analysis showed that companies that employ staff added nearly 700,000 net new jobs across the UK in 2014-15 - the highest number recorded in the last two decades. 
ERC at ISBE
ERC researchers contributed 9 papers to the ISBE conference held in held at the Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Centre, Glasgow of which eight were nominated in their track for Best Paper. 
Promoting data access
Robust analysis requires high quality data and one of the Enterprise Research Centre's goals is to enable better exploitation of existing data on SMEs and support the development of new data sources. Much ERC analysis is based on firm-level micro-data accessed via a team project on the UK Data Service's Secure Lab. Over the last couple of months we have taken some steps to encourage broader use of some of the ERC's key data resources and promote a new data source (the Longitudinal Small Business Survey).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>2014- March
One of ERC's objectives is to generate major policy or practice impacts and in its second year, ERC can evidence doing this in a number of ways. A wide range of engagements have been undertaken and these are not exhaustively recorded in this report. They provide an opportunity for influencing thinking around the evidence base which is difficult to track via individuals and their organisations and may only be felt over the longer term. However, examples of engagement which is already yielding significant impacts (or might in years to come) are:
LEPS and Local Growth
The ERC has been actively involved in the local growth agenda on a number of fronts in the last year. June 2014 saw the launch of the LEP Growth Dashboard in collaboration with the GrowthAccelerator team in Grant Thornton. Its purpose is to provide each LEP with a set of simple metrics on the growth of existing firms and start-ups in the LEP area and set these alongside the key barriers to growth flagged by businesses who are seeking to grow and have become a participant in the Growth Accelerator programme. The Dashboard, based primarily on ONS data, can be used as a source of evidence to inform discussions on priorities in business support and includes easily understood metrics which can be readily updated on an annual basis. The LEP Growth Dashboard is now forming an important input into the discussions at LEP level into the focus of business support in the aftermath of the LEP Growth Deals landing in July 2014 and in particular the design of the Growth Hubs and associated business support spend under ESIF allocations from April 2015. We undertook a series of LEP workshops in October and November to disseminate the LEP Growth Dashboard, alongside the industrial sector clusters work developed by Hart and Danes on behalf of BIS, and develop the understanding of key personnel in the LEP network on the value of the Dashboard and what future metrics could be produced

The ERC research team are also working closely with the BIS Local Growth team to use the LEP Growth Dashboard framework to inform the shape and focus of the national level Local Growth Strategy. We provided updated and extended data for BIS and CLG in August 2014 and we are in active discussions on further data requirements at local economic area level. Much of this analysis informed our contributions to the FSB report on &amp;quot;A new design: making local support work for business&amp;quot;, which was launched in February 2015.
Business Support Evaluation
ERC has been involved in a number of discussions with BIS about assessing the impact of business support and in particular advising on how to arrive at a productivity-based evaluation framework. Our contribution built on the evidence provided to the All Party Parliamentary Small Business Group Inquiry on SMEs and Productivity in 2014 and which reported in February 2015 (written and oral evidence provided).
ERC researchers have been providing expertise to the design and implementation of quasi-experimental evaluation methodologies related to business support. This contribution concerns a number of RCTs related to new business support products and services in England. ERC has been involved in each of the three RCTs currently running in the UK, advising on the initial design of the BIS Growth Voucher programme and having on-going involvement with the other two RCTs - the Growth Impact Pilot and the University Growth Voucher programme run by a consortium of Small Business Charter Business Schools. Both programmes were launched in 2014.
ERC have been engaged with the What Works Centre on Local Growth in the context of business support to develop their work with the LEPs. We assisted in the development of an agenda for their meeting in Leeds (October 2014) with the LEPs and hosted by the Cabinet Office to discuss the appetite for experimentation in evaluation across the range of business advice interventions proposed in the SEPs and ESIF documents which go live for funding projects in April 2015. ERC provided the WWC with a spectrum of business advice interventions (from light touch information provision through diagnosis and brokerage to intensive business growth programmes) that could become a menu for LEPs to select from as they engage with this agenda. It is this menu that will provide the framework for the introduction of RCTs in this delivery space.
BIS Enterprise 2020
ERC were invited to participate in discussions about the development of the BIS Enterprise 2020 Strategy document. Participation in an initial 'sandpit' workshop in November 2014 with a range of government stakeholders led to a more detailed and focused follow-up discussion with ERC in January 2015 to ensure the policy discussions continue to be grounded in the evidence base as they are developed. In addition, ERC provided a rapid response to a BIS ED exercise on policy prioritisation. 2 of ERC's recommendations were subsequently taken forward in BIS' overall set of priorities. 

2015March to July 2015
? We have published two collaborative reports over this period. The innovation benchmarks report was launched with Enterprise Europe Network and the Growth Dashboard was a collaboration with the Business Growth Service. 
? We are undertaking the evaluation of the Birmingham Venturefest event which was held on the 30th June. ERC also participated in the event reporting on the Growth Dashboard and Innovation Benchmarks reports. 
? Stephen Roper and Katherine Hathaway did a presentation on ERC to the ESRC Council in May. This focussed very much on ERC's policy focus and impact and engagement activities. 
? We have been actively engaging with the banks over the last quarter in a series of meetings with Barclays, Lloyds and RBS. Mark Hart presented to Lloyds Board on the Growth Dashboard and M2000 companies and further presentations within Lloyds are planned. Mark Hart has also been working with Matt Smith (CEO, Office, Building and Commercial Banking, RBS) who is leading the REAP London project and has been assisting them with data issues regarding their focus on building a support offer for growth firms in London.
? We held a joint event with CDFA (the second of this type) examining the factors shaping the growth of micro-firms. This was well attended and led to some further interesting network opportunities with HMRC. 
August to October 2015
? ERC research was a central feature of two workshops organised by BIS. Results from the Sociology of Enterprise and an element of the work from the Ambition research theme were presented as part of a workshop on entrepreneurial mindsets. Research drawing on Theme 6 was presented at a workshop on productivity.
? ERC was invited by UKCES to contribute to its 'Masterclass' series. A presentation drawing on their productivity analysis was given by Jun Du and Karen Bonner (20th Nov 2015).
? ERC is working with the Pink Shoe Club to host a joint event (28th Nov) focussed on womens' enterprise. Mark Hart will share some results from the GEM project at this event and other ERC staff will contribute to panel discussions. 
? ERC have been invited to give a presentation to HMRC on small firms and innovation in December 2015. This is pleasing as it creates an opportunity to identify potential opportunities for further collaboration and data sharing. 
? ERC continues to be approached by different organisations to provide 'SME intelligence'. One recent example is an invitation from BIS to participate in a workshop on incubators and accelerators as a contribution to the development of a new policy paper. ERC data/evidence currently also supporting at least 3 CSR 2015 bids.
November 2015 to January 2016
Unlocking UK productivity - internationalisation and innovation in SMEs
The report makes the following main arguments:
? The UK has an opportunity to enhance its productivity. Whilst before 2008 productivity in the UK was on a strong upward trend, the UK's productivity performance has since weakened. Improving this has become a vital agenda for the UK government.
? SMEs have a key role to play in addressing this challenge: The SME contribution to the UK economy is significant. Boosting SME productivity growth can have a significant impact on UK productivity growth at large.
? The role of internationalisation and innovation in boosting SME productivity growth has been relatively underexplored. Evidence strongly indicates that those businesses that engage in international activity and innovation are more likely to enhance firm performance - including productivity growth. 
? It is estimated that between 9 and 12% of non-exporting firms within the UK could become exporters and just over half that do export could become persistent exporters. Together these two groups include more than 110,000 SMEs in the UK economy. If they are successfully encouraged to export or export persistently, an additional &amp;pound;1.15 billion Gross Value Added (GVA) could be added to the UK economy within the first year.
? Internationally active SMEs are three times more likely to introduce products or services that are new to their sector than those which are entirely domestic in orientation. Despite this positive relationship, however, only 1 in 5 employer SMEs are exporters.
? The limited engagement by SMEs in internationalisation and innovation can be
explained, in part, by SMEs' low growth ambition: UK SMEs are demonstrated to be less 'growth inclined' and ambitious than other G8 economies. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor alone has pointed to a 17% growth aspiration in the UK among entrepreneurs vs 27% in the US. 
Profiling job growth in 2015
The key points emphasised:
? Employer enterprises - those with at least one employee, including all businesses from start-ups through to large multinationals - created or added a total of 2.52 million jobs. This was offset by enterprises contracting or going out of business altogether, which saw 1.83 million jobs lost, giving a net job creation figure for the UK SME sector of 695,500.
? Of the new jobs added, 1.5 million were created by existing companies expanding. In addition, a record number of start-up firms added a further 1 million. This took the total number of private sector employees to a record 20.3 million.
? The figures on UK companies show that 299,591 firms were 'born' in 2014-15. This was the highest number of start-up 'births' in a single year since comparable records began in 1997.
? The total number of employer enterprises across the UK rose to just under 1.8 million, also a record. These firms account for approximately one third of all businesses in the UK, the remaining two-thirds (3.6 million) including the self-employed, partnerships and enterprises with zero employees.
Other Impact Activities
? ERC presented material from the Innovation in Legal Services projects at two workshops organised by the Legal Services Board and the Law Society in November 2015. 
? ERC partnered with the Department of Trade and Investment (NI) to hold a workshop focussing on 'Innovation in micro-businesses evidence and policy support' in Belfast in November 2015. 
? ERC were invited to present a summary of current research evidence to the Business Taxation team in HMRC in December 2015. This part of an on-going dialogue with HMRC which we hope will develop into a future collaborative project (on exporting and productivity) and dialogue around Growth Hubs.
? ERC together with ISBE (Institute for Small Business and Entrepreneurship) held a meeting to discuss building a range of research led activities which promote SME growth through university/SME engagement. This recognised the transition of the Community of Interest into an ISBE Special Interest Group. Contacts at the meeting led to the opportunity to meet with Business Wales in January. 
? ERC partnered with UKTI in a November event organised by Warwick Business School to present research results relating to mid-sized businesses. A further series of events are planned for March - June 2016. 
? Sara Carter was appointed as a member of the International Scientific Advisory Board, Center for Agricultural Business Management, Swedish University of Agricultural Science.
? Sara Carter also delivered a 'Distinguished Professorial Address' 'Does Entrepreneurship Make You Wealthy?' University of West of England, October 2015.
? ERC's Michael Anyadike-Danes has accepted an appointment onto the Microbusiness Research Portal Advisory Board comprising a range of experts from across government, academia and private sector. The Microbusiness Research Portal is being launched as part of a partnership between the ONS (Office for National Statistics), the University of St Andrews and Middlesex University, with the active support of BIS to provide a powerful source of research evidence for policy-makers and practitioners as well a unique academic research resource for those interested in the characteristics, drivers, growth and development of microbusiness.
? Recent PR work to support the launch of Unlocking UK productivity - internationalisation and innovation in SMEs was significantly affected by the news of the attacks in Paris. The pre-Christmas work on the latest business population data was more successful including radio and press coverage. Future plans are being prepared for the forthcoming M2000 Report and Jun Du's report on Productivity as well as on the latest high growth firms data.
? ERC continues to be approached by different organisations to provide 'SME intelligence'. One recent example is an invitation from BIS to participate in a workshop on incubators and accelerators as a contribution to the development of a new policy paper.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE5607C3-C6FB-4110-9BE4-8AF18AD84EA1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmace</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.enterpriseresearch.ac.uk/our-work/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/84575CA0-4F92-4FA7-9709-881942834DB3"><gtr:id>84575CA0-4F92-4FA7-9709-881942834DB3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Technology Sourcing and Reverse Productivity Spillovers in the Multinational Enterprise: Global or Regional Phenomenon?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>British Journal of Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4b9edf48cdc9b882ff3cfb1ec92ceac5"><gtr:id>4b9edf48cdc9b882ff3cfb1ec92ceac5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Driffield N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/02A785B5-7E62-4A88-8E1E-2509E6B0610D"><gtr:id>02A785B5-7E62-4A88-8E1E-2509E6B0610D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Erratum to: &amp;quot;A stochastic frontier approach to modelling financial constraints in firms: An application to India&amp;quot; [J.
