Compared to other migrant groups, British-Bangladeshis (numbering about half a million) report poorer health and more long term illness or disability including diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Contributing factors may be racial intolerance and prejudice, levels of acculturation/integration and appropriate and accessible service provision. Using questionnaires, physical measurements and biological markers measured in saliva, this project will compare how different generations of British-Bangladeshis living in large communities in London (who may be buffered against some stressors associated with migration) and small, more ethnically isolated communities in the northeast have acculturated to UK life by examining their social, psychological and physical wellbeing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Project asks if northeast Bangladeshis are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>more integrated&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>experience more discrimination and racism&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>have poorer health&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>make greater demands of local health services&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>require fewer social services (such as language classes) compared to London migrants.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>No previous studies have conducted such detailed comparisons of acculturation and wellbeing among Bangladeshis in relation to their migration experience. This Project will therefore be helpful for predicting the social and health requirements of ethnically-diverse migrants living at different densities in the UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries of the research include health and social policy makers from local authorities, strategic health authorities and health care providers plus third sector intermediaries between the former organisations and community users. All of these will benefit from accessing more detailed information than currently exists concerning regional patterns of acculturation and well being for which Bangladeshi migrants may seek help, or be urged to seek help. More broadly, the NHS will benefit from having collated information about regional differences in health between NE UK and London and how these differences relate to overall variations and inequalities in health across the UK. Our work may also help in designing early interventions to prevent later health issues from arising. 
 We can no longer accept that poor physical and mental health is an uncontrollable consequence of migration. Equally we cannot assume that all populations adapt to variations in environments at similar speeds. We must ensure that service providers account for cultural and regional variations in public health knowledge, access to health and social services, and beliefs and health behaviours of different populations. Furthermore we cannot assume individuals in our diverse society fully understand UK health and social infrastructures. Liaison with local policy makers at an early stage will ensure our research makes a difference. We will seek their views and establish what changes have already taken place and discuss their efficacy. The economic and social implications of this research will include the long term gains made in alleviating pressures on public health and social services whose resources are already stretched. Our findings about integration and acculturation can also help policy makers who are influential in determining political and social agendas in relation to ethnic minorities and migrants, and social workers who are interested in potential interventions to improve health. Above all, beneficiaries will include Bangladeshi communities in the UK since the project will serve to provide us with regional information about the impact of migration on health and stress and seeks to involve their input as the work progresses. 
 Finally, we plan to disseminate our work to Bangladeshis still living in Sylhet from where most future migrants are likely to originate. There appear to be many misconceptions about life in Britain following migration, primarily because remittances from the UK and other countries provide the bulk of economic income to Sylhet. It will undoubtedly be helpful for potential future migrants to appreciate the real economic, social and health problems that can face them when they anticipate making this challenging transition.
 Our experience has shown that valid results from research can take time to realise and are likely to have maximum impact when we begin to analyse data that have been collected. Benefits are likely to be realised during the third and final years of the Project and thereafter. However, we do have earlier data from our prior projects that we can already translate into health messages to the local Bangladeshi community that can provide some early benefits. This will also help us to cement relationships with community organizations as we develop connections in NE UK.
Staff working on the project will receive thorough training (via Durham University HR or external courses, or directly from the PIs) and will have the opportunity to develop skills in the following areas: communication, teamwork, leadership, time management, ethnographic fieldwork, anthropometrics, laboratory work for the analyses of salivary biomarkers, qualitative and quantitative analyses including the use of Nvivo and statistics, data management, community education, presentations, publications, web design, media work and liaison with multidisciplinary service delivery groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>533222</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School outreach</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>687755AA-DA50-4158-8735-935FDD6C6745</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduced school students to university research and education about science

It addressed whether northeast Bangladeshis are: a) more integrated, b) experience more discrimination and racism, c) have poorer health, d) make greater demands of health services, and e) require fewer social services compared to London migrants. 
We achieved our target of recruiting 540 participants into the Project (total n=562). Key findings are that northeastern Bangladeshis are: 1) significantly less acculturated than London Bangladeshis (and London men are more acculturated than London women), 2) experience greater degrees of discrimination, 3) report better health, 4) access practice nurses, but not GPs, more often, and 5) use fewer local social services. Overall, length of time spent in the UK (i.e., being second generation) resulted in greater acculturation, as did higher levels of education and income. These findings will prove useful in informing local councils, for example, how to direct services towards ethnic and migrant populations. 
Significantly more people in London reported higher incomes compared to the northeast, but more Londoners received both child and housing benefits despite family sizes being smaller than the northeast. More people in London were renters as opposed to home owners, probably reflecting higher housing costs in the capital. Northeasterners use fewer local services but also report having less available. It is possible that, in comparing north and south, we are observing a &amp;quot;London&amp;quot; effect in terms of higher acculturation/lower discrimination as well as greater measures of inequality between families. Perhaps more densely populated, Bangladeshi migrant populations living in Birmingham, for example, might be different. Further studies could address these issues. 
In relation to health, second-generation Bangladeshis had higher levels of inflammation (measured from salivary C-reactive protein) compared to the first-generation which might place them at greater risk for cardiovascular diseases later in life. We hypothesize that these differences relate to developmental conditions experienced in early life. About two-thirds of participants, overall, had abdominal obesity and one-third were generally obese, also increasing disease risks including type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, more highly acculturated individuals, those who reported greater discrimination, and those who had physical limitations were more stressed (measured from salivary cortisol levels).
We are delighted with the richness of our results and our ability to use these to inform community and government contacts who can assist ethnic groups. Our next task is to develop this outreach further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are several ways in which these findings can be built upon by others. First, our findings in relation to acculturation are useful in pointing out what factors assist migrants groups in identifying with their host culture. While length of time being exposed to the host culture is one factor, key variables included being better educated, and having jobs that lead to people identifying as financially secure. Ensuring migrants have access to education and employment is therefore critical. Our health findings, again, point to the importance of assessing generation as a factor in evaluating health of migrants rather than lumping them as one group. Poverty reduction strategies, health education and behavioral changes may help in tackling the high prevalence of obesity among Bangladeshis living in England.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AB182BF5-E07D-4776-9D7F-AFB332E28731</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.dur.ac.uk/research/directory/staff/?id=4377</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Australia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7902624B-6A6B-4229-B94C-3FAC6E122848</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of an international advisory group called Gravida based in New Zealand which is interested in the effects of early life on later life health and advises the New Zealand Government</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gravida.org.nz/what-we-do/research-findings-and-impacts</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6CEFA6FA-D52F-40E2-AED7-E137E4723905"><gtr:id>6CEFA6FA-D52F-40E2-AED7-E137E4723905</gtr:id><gtr:title>Early environment and C-reactive protein.
