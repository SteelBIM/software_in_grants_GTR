1905-2016</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003887/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Twentieth-century Britain was subject to regular bouts of 'pageant fever'. Communities of all sizes and character across England, Scotland and Wales staged theatrical re-enactments of events from local and national history with thousands of men, women and children involved as performers, organizers and spectators. This was national costume drama on a grand scale. Over the course of the twentieth century many hundreds of events were mounted by communities and institutions, ranging from small churches and village communities to large cities such as Liverpool and Manchester. In addition, institutions as diverse as the Army, the Church of England the Women's Co-operative Guild also staged historical pageants. The fever was especially intense at certain times, notably the Edwardian era, the 1930s and 1950s (encouraged by the Festival of Britain and the 1953 Coronation), but the tradition never fully died out and there were revivals in the 1970s and during the millennium celebrations. A distinctive feature of historical pageantry has been the involvement not only of communities but also of prominent individuals, such as G.K. Chesterton and G.M. Trevelyan.

Drawing on oral and written evidence, this project is a landmark intervention. It will provide an authoritative treatment of a subject that has largely escaped academic scrutiny despite the rich insights that these apparently ephemeral events can give into popular understandings of the past. The project also offers key insights into the role of 'heritage' in leisure activities, the interaction between local, national and imperial identities, and the character of community life. Differences and similarities between the regions and nations of Britain, and continuities and changes over time, are central to the project and will be explored in depth. The comprehensive coverage of local events - based on geographically dispersed sources - will support, stimulate and publicize the activities of local historians and historical associations, and provide a useful resource for all those interested in the history of communities and institutions, including schools. It will recover the stories that communities and institutions told about themselves. It will result in a comprehensive database of historical pageants, a monograph envisaged as the key book on the subject, and an edited volume of essays situating the British movement in its international context. Every historical pageant for which any significant record exists comes under the scope of the study and the interactive publicly-accessible resource at its centre.

The website will include general commentary on the pageant movement, representative images of pageant-related ephemera, and oral testimonies from witnesses to historical pageants. It will allow interaction between the public and the project, enabling individual users and local history societies - some of whom will be actively involved in the project - to contribute their own memories and memorabilia. It will feature interactive maps, allowing users to locate pageant venues and to track the incidence of performances and themes over time. The website will be an important tool for historians, as well as scholars of literature and drama, historical geography and cultural studies. Through the database, these users will be able to access and process a vast body of information relating to the content, organization and experience of historical pageants, allowing the exploration of, for example, the evolving depiction of specific historical events and themes, the authorship of pageant scripts, and constructions of popular memory. The database will also encourage wider use of pageant-related archival holdings by academic and other users. The project will thus enhance academic and non-academic understandings of an important twentieth-century phenomenon, drawing together a remarkably rich collection of visual, oral and textual resources, much of which is on the verge of being lost.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who benefits?
The project will significantly impact on public engagement with history. The database and website will be of value to diverse groups, including:
- Archives/museums
- Local historians/local history societies; others interested in local history including schools
- Institutions investigating their own history, e.g. churches/organizations which staged pageants; custodians of pageant sites (e.g. National Trust)
- Family historians
- Those promoting local historical awareness, e.g. Victoria County History, British History Online, www.historypin.com
- Local history organizations, including named Project Partners: Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery, Carlisle; St Albans Museums; Uttlesford Recorders; St Edmundsbury Heritage Service
How?
The project will stimulate and support public engagement with 20th-century British history. The first version of the website will be available early in year 1, along with a project blog and 'pageant of the month' feature, with a mechanism to support public submission of material (see Technical Appendix). Anticipated benefits include:
- Recognition by user groups of the value of pageants for understanding the history of British villages, towns and cities. In pageants large numbers of participants and spectators of all ages and backgrounds sought to capture and interpret the history of their communities. Not only were pageants important socio-historical moments, but they also constitute a valuable type of folk history. By identifying, recovering and making accessible historical evidence of pageants, the project supports and publicizes the work of local historians, as well as stimulating local communities' and institutions' interest in their own histories.
- Project Partners will benefit from assistance in recovering and recording evidence of pageants in their districts, and from participation in project events. The good practice in retrieving evidence of pageants that this generates will be disseminated in the wider local history constituency.
- Increased public knowledge/understanding of the history of institutions which staged pageants commemorating their history, including the labour movement, women's organizations and religious groups. For example, the Anglican Church mounted a major pageant in 1909, and many parish churches staged multiple performances across the period. The networks established by the AHRC-funded Building on History project will help the pageant project make this history accessible to contemporary Anglican clergy and churchgoers.
- Greater knowledge/understanding of resources in museums/archives, including those run by local authorities, leading to more footfall among all types of user.
- Impact on repositories' acquisition policies, as the significance of pageant material is highlighted.
- The website will be promoted as a resource for schools: its content (images, texts, finding guides and downloadable schools guidance pack) will support teaching at various levels from advanced primary to A-Level/Higher.
- The project's record of individuals' participation in pageants will facilitate the work of family historians and genealogists, a key constituency for all historical e-resources.
- The project's recovery of documentation of pageants staged at sites now maintained by heritage bodies (e.g. Wolvesley Castle, Craigmillar Castle) will not only assist in the interpretation of such sites for visitors, but could facilitate the reenactment of the spectacles these pageants generated as a visitor attraction.
- The project will inform and contextualize forthcoming pageant performances (e.g. in Bury St Edmunds in 2014); it may also encourage the organization of future pageants, and will contribute to ongoing public debates about local/national identities.
- The skills developed by the RAs (e.g. interpreting sources, interviewing, event planning) will not only enhance their potential contributions to academia, but also to other areas, e.g the heritage sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>777580</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Free exhibition on pageants at Moyses Hall, Bury St Edmunds, devised, researched and written by project team in collaboration with project partners (see project partners section).

They said: &amp;quot;The Chelsea Historical Pageant was a new aspect for me of a subject I already knew something about', and found the event &amp;quot;very interesting&amp;quot;. They added that they would come to another similar event.
 
Another said it was &amp;quot;a very informative discussion. The speaker clearly knew a lot&amp;quot; and said that they now learned &amp;quot;the meaning of the word pageant!' as well as &amp;quot;the historical relevance and importance of them.&amp;quot; They also added that they would come to another similar event.
 
Another member of the public heard about the event on Radio London, and described it as &amp;quot;wonderful - very informative - well presented!&amp;quot;
 
Another heard about the event through the Garden History Writing Group, and said they found the event &amp;quot;Really very good, nice atmosphere. Very good speaker.&amp;quot; Asked if they learned anything new, they replied &amp;quot;Very educational! I had no prior knowledge of British pageant history.&amp;quot;

In 2015, as the world marked the eighth century of Magna Carta, our exhibition at Moyse's Hall told the story of these three pageants - two of which had much to say about the town's association with that historical document.

It brought together participants from different countries and disciplines to consider how communities, institutions and groups have presented history in dramatic forms over time.

Acknowledging the growing body of scholarship on historical performance, often involving researchers from different disciplines, this conference was aimed at scholars and practitioners across the disciplinary spectrum, including history, theatre and film studies, sociology and anthropology, the visual and performing arts, music and literature, folklore, education and cultural studies broadly defined. It also involved contributions from the heritage and information sectors. The aim of the conference was to range across different national and transnational contexts in its exploration of historical pageants and other forms of historical performance.

Questions the conference addressed included the following:

 How has history been presented in dramatic form to different audiences? What meanings are associated with participation in, and observation of, historical re-enactments and dramatic performances?

 How has the nature and cultural significance of historical performances changed over time?

 How important is 'authenticity' in historical performance?

 What does the dramatic presentation of history tell us about personal, local and national identities, and about public interest in the past?

 What is the relationship between historical performance and other forms of cultural engagement with the past?

 What are the ethical implications of representing history in dramatic form?

 What insights can be gained from comparative perspectives on historical performance?

 What contributions did (and can) the performing arts make in the heritage sector, popular history, and history education?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/about/history-limelight-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>HIstory of Education conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>91D13839-8218-468C-9F40-5952C6B301F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Representations of war and social upheaval in British historical pageants, 1905-1960 (International Standing Conference for the History of Education, Institute of Education, London, 23rd July 2014).

The event led directly to a collaboration with the Windrose Rural Media Trust (now a project partner), with whom we now work in the field of pageant films (an officer from the Trust attended the event).

- Public Exhibitions held at Bury St Edmunds (Moyses Hall), Carlisle (Tullie House), Scarborough (Scarborough Museums Trust; Scarborough Art Gallery), and London (King's College London, with participation/co-research from non-academic collaborator - Ellie Reid). The project team's research directly contributed to the format and content of the exhibitions (including written materials), which were genuinely collaborative products of co-research between academic and non-academic partners. 
- Workshops and public events in relation to project partners (St Albans, Bury St Edmunds, Carlisle, Scarborough, Sherborne), including for example a Pageants Study Day aimed at the general public in St Albans, organized in conjunction with St Albans Museums and involving a range of academic and non-academic speakers: http://www.stalbans.gov.uk/council-and-democracy/press-room/items/2015/may/Stimulate-the-mind---find-out-about-historical-pageants.aspx
- Activities of Local Historical Societies (Somerset and Dorset Family History Society; Sherborne Society; Scarborough Archaeological and Historical Society). The Somerset and Dorset Family History Society has, for example, begun a genealogical project based on the participants in the 1905 Sherborne pageant, which draws to a significant extent on our project and its findings.
- Activities of other bodies: Windrose Rural Media Trust. The Trust has drawn on our project to inform its film preservation activites. This collaboration derived directly from our public engagement work with pageant films in Bury St Edmunds, Sherborne and elsewhere. https://histpag.dighum.kcl.ac.uk/film/
- The work of the project, particularly in relation to public engagement, has featured in local media (local newspapers, BBC Cumbria), including local community forums, e.g. http://www.ourwarwickshire.org.uk/content/article/warwick-pageant-1906-legacy

Historical pageants were put on in villages, towns and cities up and down the country; hundreds of thousands of people were involved as volunteer actors, organizers, dressmakers, fund-raisers, and much else besides; millions more enjoyed these often large-scale events as spectators. Involving casts of hundreds, even thousands, pageants told the stories of local communities through chronologically-ordered scenes or episodes featuring notable events from local history. Historical pageants had a significant cultural impact. But, despite being one of the most significant means by which twentieth-century Britons engaged with their local and national pasts, they have not received anything like the attention they deserved. The Redress of the Past project has provided a powerful corrective to this neglect. In doing so, it has offered key insights into the interaction between local, national and imperial identities, and the changing character of community life, and differences and similarities between the regions and nations of Britain. 

Significant achievements include:
1. Database
The award has resulted in the creation of a major digital output: the Redress of the Past database of historical pageants. This is freely available via the project website, here: http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/pageants/. The database contains entries of over 500 pageants (and growing, likely to approach 600 by the end of the project). These entries list a wealth of information about individual historical pageants. Insofar as records allow we have recorded details of the times and places of performances, those involved in organising and staging them, and how many people attended. For each pageant, we have also recorded, again as fully as possible, whether the pageant made or lost money, details of the music that was played and who composed it, and synopses of the individual episodes. In addition, for each pageant record we provide lists of the names of notable historical figures that featured in the action. Last, and perhaps most important, we have written summaries explaining each pageant and placing it in its wider historical context. These range from short paragraphs to essays of upwards of 5,000 words for larger and more significant pageants. They are fully footnoted and engage critically with relevant secondary literature. In sum, we estimate that the database contains between 1.5 million and 2 million words. Covering all of the larger pageants performed in twentieth-century Britain as well as a broadly representative sample of smaller pageants the database is a major contribution to knowledge and understanding.

2. More specific findings (by no means an exhaustive list):

- The sheer scale and variety of the historical pageant movement has been revealed for the first time. We have demonstrated that pageantry was one of the main means by which people engaged with the past in twentieth-century Britain. A whole new field of scholarly inquiry has been opened.

- Much light has been shed on the importance of the past-including the distant past-to the civic identities of large towns and cities. Pageants were, for example, a key vector of 'civic boosterism' for industrial towns as well as sleepy villages and rural market towns, particularly in the interwar period. This has gone almost entirely unnoticed, and is the subject of a project article published in Urban History (2016).

- The project has shed much light on small towns and villages also. Notably, our work has challenged the view that local civic cultures were in decline from the Edwardian period on, revealing the continuing vitality of these cultures until at least the 1950s. Some of our preliminary findings on this theme are summarised in a forthcoming co-authored essay.

- We now have a much better sense of what aspects of the past mattered most, and where and when it mattered most, than ever before. The persisting importance of the medieval past to local and national identities has been an important finding, and is the subject of a major article, co-authored by the whole project team, which has been submitted to the English Historical Review and is now being revised in the light of favourable readers' reports.

- The impact of war. Pageants were an important means by which men and women-and local communities-came to terms with the impact of war; they provided a notably effective means of integrating it into long-established historical narratives. Despite the shattering experience of 1914-18, these narratives provided resilient and adaptable: historical pageants offered important redress to a shell-shocked modernity. Some of our findings on this theme are discussed in a major forthcoming co-authored article in Historical Research.

- The changing role played by women in historical pageantry, and by extension local associational and community life, has been brought into much sharper focus. It was known that women were involved in suffrage and League of Nations pageants. What was not appreciated, until this project, was the extent of their involvement in other pageants. Further, the project has revealed the changing perception of women's role in popular understandings of the history of particular places and institutions.

- The project has revealed much about the changing relationship between local and national identities, and also the links between these identities and the past. British local (and regional) identities are still relatively understudied, often seen as being opposed to national identity, and nationalising trends. There remains an assumption that as national identities strengthened from the later nineteenth century on, local identities lost popular purchase. Our project has revealed that local and national identities (as celebrated in pageants) were mutually supportive, not antagonistic, at least until the 1960s. The intense pride of locality celebrated in pageants fed into wider national loyalties, and this was true in Wales and Scotland as well as England. 

In addition to publicising these findings through the project database, website, publications and our three exhibitions (http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/events/), in a little over three years we have delivered more than forty seminar papers, lectures, and other presentations, to non-academic as well as academic audiences: http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/about/papers-presented/. As set out in the grant application, a monograph - to be completed after the end of the project - is being prepared, as is an edited collection of essays based on the major international conference we held in September 2016. Work on both of these post-project outputs is well underway.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- The project resulted in three exhibitions relating to historical pageantry (one of which was repeated). This was more than we anticipated, and suggests that the research can be further exploited in this way. Indeed, St Albans Museums are planning a pageants exhibition with input from project team members. These exhibitions proved good contexts for public engagement of various kinds, including film evenings and memory days (as in Bury St Edmunds). The research could therefore be used to good effect by local museums and galleries.
- We also achieved considerable success in engaging local historical societies (e.g. Sherborne Society, Somerset and Dorset Family History Society, Scarborough Archaeological and historical society). We will be reaching out to more local societies to publicize the website and its findings. Judging by the size of some of the audiences at the events we put on, there is considerable further potential here.
- The oral testimonies gathered by the project team (some of which are available on the website) are a valuable resource in themselves, and very helpfully supported our exhibition work (at Carlisle and Bury St Edmunds in particular). But our approach could be adopted by others. 
- The database itself is well adapted for use by non-academic communities, schools, and university education. One university (not part of the project) even sent us some undergraduate interns to work on the project. They gained valuable experience of what a major, publicly funded research project looked like, and engaged actively and creatively with our work. We know from experience at King's, UCL and Exeter that the database and website is an excellent teaching resource, and indeed team members (and non team members) have integrated it into their teaching. There is untapped potential for engagement with schools.
- There is some scope for the research findings being taken forward by practitioners. The project has attracted the interest of artists, and one could imagine it providing the basis for community art projects of various kinds. Indeed we are scoping this as a possibility for follow-on funding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49A496DE-0F47-4EC7-950E-5825A82A792C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.historicalpageants.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The project has developed a major database of historical pageants.
