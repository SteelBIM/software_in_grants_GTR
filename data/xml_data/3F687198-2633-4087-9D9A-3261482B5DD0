Our brains combine these to give us a unified view of the world, while using the subtle differences between them to impart a rich perception of the world in 3D. Understanding this process will tell us more about perception in general, as well as suggesting how we might in future be able to help people in whom this process has failed, for example in squint. Our brains have developed very precise circuitry for controlling eye movements, in order to ensure that both eyes always look at the same thing and in order to minimise any vertical offsets between the images. When we look straight ahead, the two eye?s images differ only by horizontal offsets, reflecting the horizontal displacement of our eyes. However, when we move our eyes around a visual scene, small vertical disparities are inevitable. Does our brain predict the expected vertical disparities, given the current position of the eyes? Or does it simply allow for some range, treating vertical disparities as noise in the system? The answer will help us understand the sophisticated computations which underlie our effortless perception.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A fundamental problem of binocular vision is matching up points on the two retinae which are viewing the same object in space. If our eyes were fixed in the head, always pointing forwards to infinity, the images of a given object would always be horizontally offset from one another, and this stereo correspondence problem would be one-dimensional. However, the freedom to move our eyes around a visual scene necessarily introduces vertical disparities, making the problem two-dimensional. This represents a key constraint on oculomotor control: our eyes are precisely yoked together so as to keep vertical disparities to a minimum on the retina. However, it is impossible to remove vertical disparities altogether, and it is clear that the brain detects the residual vertical disparities and uses them, together with extra-retinal information on eye position, to convert horizontal disparity into a perception of depth and surface structure. 

In recent years, the response properties of disparity-selective neurons in several cortical areas have been thoroughly documented. Theoretical neuroscientists have begun to examine how populations of such neurons could be used to solve the correspondence problem and support depth perception. However, so far these models have largely ignored vertical disparity and eye movements. The goal of this project is to extend previous models to take account of these, thereby expanding the explanatory power of such models to a much wider range of stimuli. To achieve this, we shall first conduct a series of human psychophysics experiments designed to reveal how vertical disparity affects stereo correspondence. These will examine the scale at which vertical disparity is encoded, and whether it is detected by dedicated populations of neurons or simply deduced from the response of neurons to horizontal disparity. They will reveal whether the brain takes account of the changing patterns of vertical disparity experienced as the eyes move, either by changing the range within which stereo matches can be found at all, or by adjusting the a priori probability assigned to each possible match.

The results of these experiments, together with existing psychophysical and physiological knowledge, will be used to build the first neuronally-realistic stereo correspondence algorithm which handles two-dimensional disparity and allows for eye movements. The inputs to the algorithm will be realistic models of disparity-tuned neurons, while its outputs will be designed to capture human psychophysics. This model will represent one of the most complete attempts to date to link single neurons and perception.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>301248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Newcastle University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute for Ageing and Health</gtr:department><gtr:description>Psychophysical tests for cortical inhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>0F562845-12C7-428A-8881-E4A4D1FE92BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Award for NHS Flexibility and Sustainability funding (&amp;pound;18,586).

The experience this gave me in binocular vision disorders, and the collaboration established between me (Dr Read) and Drs Serrano-Pedraza and Dr Clarke was a key factor in our current &amp;pound;1M Health Innovation Challenge Fund award, &amp;quot;Accurate and patient-friendly measurement of binocular visual function using a 3D mobile device&amp;quot; (http:/research.ncl.ac.uk/asteroid), added in Further Funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Identified interesting patient group to study; helped design experiments; contacted suitable patients and invited to participate; helped run experiments.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Read and Serrano-Pedraza, in collaboration with our partners, devised the experiments.
