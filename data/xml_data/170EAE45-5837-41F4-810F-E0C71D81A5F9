The film will focus on the life stories and transnational connections of a group of musicians, the Madagascar All Stars, and show their strong engagement through songs and concert-debates in seeking to protect the extraordinary cultural and natural wealth of their country of origin: Madagascar. Building on the analytical insights of the AHRC-funded research project TNMundi AH/E508626/1 this project will engage new audiences in issues of North-South relations, transnational migration, and show links between protecting human and natural environments. Through the highly accessible form of a film with enticing musical scores and strongly engaged lyrics a wide public will be reached. In a series of debates following the film's screenings and special workshops the project will furthermore engage with civil society organisations, the media and policy makers in cultural policy and third country development, to share knowledge and develop strategies for effective future collaboration. 
Following the film's production in phase 1, phase 2 is dedicated to its dissemination and focuses on knowledge exchange, awareness raising and discussions. The film will be widely disseminated in film festivals and its issues will be debated. The combination of film screenings and workshops in the presence of some members of the research/ production/ artistic team will become the platform for engaging people in the UK and other European countries and in Madagascar itself with Madagascar's continuing struggles with poverty and environmental destruction, and the impact of internal- and out-migration in Madagascar and ultimately Europe. It will also demonstrate the cultural creativity of Malagasy artists, and through their active role as engaged singer song-writers and performers will raise awareness and new insights by positive action. Whilst the film thematises these topics through the prism of transnational networking and activism of artists in Madagascar and Europe, the issues themselves are of general global significance. 
The film concentrates on a particularly interesting outcome of Meinhof's and Dama Mahaleo's work with transnational migrant and non-migrant musicians of Malagasy origin. During field work in Madagascar and France, a few individual musicians originating from different parts of Madagascar where cultural divisions, even enmities exist until today, came together and formed a new group: the Madagascar All Stars. 'Songs for Madagascar' co-produced, directed and edited by the film company Laterit, the project's key partner, will tell the stories of these musicians and their active commitment to the natural and cultural diversity of different regions of Madagascar. Sub-titled lyrics to performed songs and narratives of the artists filmed in situ will give a vivid example of the people and their communities in the North, South and the Highland regions, next to the endangered forests, mountain areas, rice-fields and coasts from where the artists originate. The film will also show the artists' transnational lives in the places where they live today in Madagascar or in Europe, and the significance of these cosmopolitan links.
Through their examples rather than analytical talk a case will be made for the cultural benefits of migration and cultural understanding, just as creativity unleashed through transnational connections and diverse cultural influences will emerge through music and performances. The film will include footage from studio recordings and concert tours, offering insights about the internal dynamics of artists of such diverse talents and musical origins coming together. It will also demonstrate the appeal of their music to audiences of different cultures and generation</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries are especially to be found amongst the creative industries, environmental and cultural activists, governmental and non-governmental policy makers, and the general as well as a more specialist public in Europe and Madagascar. Benefit will be mainly in the domains of enhancing creativity and quality of life, knowledge transfer and education, cultural environmental and economic benefits, and policies relating to third country development, to environmental protection, and to changing negative perceptions about migration.
During the duration of the project, impact will be mainly felt in the four countries where the film will be distributed and discussed, though once the film reaches the expected distribution on television and in cinemas its impact will spread beyond these localities.

Creative Industries:
- The film company Laterit will be able to produce and widely disseminate a feature-length documentary film with the support of the AHRC and the PI, and through the workshops arouse focused debates of key issues. This will add to Laterit's already strong reputation as documentary film-makers, enable future collaborative project developments at EU level and ensure commercial benefit through distribution of the film in commercial cinemas and the sale of DVDs.
- The artists at the centre of the project will profit from the publicity of the film, and will also accrue economic benefit from the granting of artistic rights for their songs. They will furthermore benefit in seeing the strongly-felt concerns expressed in their Malagasy-language songs for the cultural and environmental protection of their country of origin made more accessible through the medium of a sub-titled film. They will also benefit by being able to engage in debates with important policy-makers.
- Film-makers and the organisers of film festivals will be introduced to an innovative music documentary about Madagascar with a strong socio-cultural theme.

Environmental education, cultural heritage preservation and enhancement of quality of life: 
- The film will raise awareness about the interdependency of cultural and natural environments in Madagascar and in Europe. Inhabitants of rural communities in Madagascar where the film will be shot will benefit by being involved as active participants in expressing their concerns to the outside world in a new and accessible medium. At the same time the interaction between the artists who originate in these communities and the local people will enable new insights in the communities about their dependency on the preservation of their natural environment.

NGOs and Governmental bodies engaged in third country development, environmental protection, education, and multiculturalism in Europe. 
-Through the workshops and the film screenings there will be knowledge exchange about alternative creative methods for tackling complex problems about development and cultural and environmental protection in third countries. A new popular medium for making concerns heard will be developed. Negative views about migrants will be challenged.

 NGOs, governmental bodies in Madagascar 
-Similar to the above but with an additional immediate benefit for addressing vital issues for local communities in Madagascar through an easily accessible popular medium 

The general public and the special-interest public at film festivals 
-The film will be shown to large sections of the public, initially through dedicated film festivals and workshop screenings but also on general release to cinemas and television. The film will be in an entertaining format but will contain challenging and awareness raising themes to add to knowledge and increase appreciation about cultural and environmental factors in fragile rural communities in Madagascar and demonstrate the role that music can play in this. The main focus is on Madagascar and the transnational commitment of its musicians, but the theme has global significance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-12-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80172</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The film Songs for Madagascar is the realisation of the part of my previous AHRC funded research Diaspora as Social and Cultural Practice (TNMundi) that focused on Madagascar and its musicians in translation networks.

Synopsis:
Songs for Madagascar offers an intimate journey across the island of Madagascar and parts of Europe. It closely follows the creative work of a group of musicians and shows their encounters with local communities. The film allows us to discover the artists' 'transcultural capital', and show firsthand their social, cultural and environmental commitment to one of the most endangered islands in the world.
TREATMENT
A group of musicians of Mada- gascan origin who live in Madagascar and in Europe have come together in spite of their geographical and cultural differences. Through their music and their songs they raise awareness worldwide about their country and about other fragile environments.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A2C7C3C-842D-4BE4-812D-6EB2C94A7873</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film with the relevant subtitles has so far been shown 4 times, including two screenings at international film festivals (Screenplay festival on the Shetland Islands, and the Festival dei Popoli in Florence), as well as Southampton Film week and most recently at a specially set up event at la Reunion, including a conference and two concerts by the Madagascar All Stars in the centre of the film. .

In the previous questionnaires that Meinhof had administered to the audience key statements included comments such as I never knew anything about Madagascar, and its environmental problems, poverty, people etc but now I am curious to find out a lot more. This audience's comments were more informed and directly relating to what should or could be done. Many of the questions and answer sequences were directly addressing the musician Dama Mahaleo (Zafimahaleo Rasolofondraosolo) , a former independent MP in the Malagasy National Assembly who had worked with Ulrike Meinhof as consultant on the TNMundi project as well as an adviser on the making of the film.
