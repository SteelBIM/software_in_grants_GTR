capacity and extending reach</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006711/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Co-design, the direct engagement of all stakeholders in design activities for the purpose of addressing complex problems, is seen as a way for supporting and enhancing collective creativity and leading to better, more sustainable solutions. Co-design is also becoming an important theme in community research and within community-academic partnerships. The summit organized by the AHRC-led Connected Communities program in July 2012 highlighted the need to tackle the theme of 'community engagement in and with research'. 
 
Within this context, the co-design and co-delivery of research and practice in community-academic partnerships is increasingly seen as a valuable paradigm for tackling complex social problems based on the principles of shared vision, equitable involvement, ownership and trust, capacity building and relevance. Despite their differences, those involved (community groups, community organisations and academics) recognize that through their partnership and interconnections they can create new opportunities for innovation and build their ability to identify and solve complex issues that would not have been possible to do alone. However this is not a trivial task. It requires the development of a shared vision, equitable involvement and trust, and overcoming limitations in resources, but also differences in culture, terminology/language used and methodology/practice. This challenge sets the scene for this project. 
 
The project proposes and reflects on a process for co-designing research in community-academic partnerships based on set of co-creative techniques that we call 'Design by Consensus'. The process is based on 'role playing' and collaborative visioning techniques. The aim of the proposed process is to unleash and build upon the intrinsic capacities of communities, community organizations and academic institutions in order to form a common research vision, helping scale up their practice and extend their reach. This process will result to the following outputs: 
- the development of a visionary code of practice/framework for community-academic co-creation and co-delivery of research using a set of shared principles; 
- the specification of research agendas that can help community-academic partnerships build their capacity using their existing assets and extend their reach and practice; 
- the production of a 'sketchbook/notebook of reflections' that aims to visually record reflections but also emotions for the proposed process, community-academic partnership and their outputs. 
 
The above outputs set the foundation for the co-delivery of research in phase 2.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries and the relevance of the proposed project is described as follows: 
 
- Local communities such as communities that focus on neighbourhood planning, regeneration, activism etc. will be given the opportunity to engage in a process of identifying issues and ideas for research that will be useful and relevant to them. Phase 2 will also give them the opportunity to realize some of these ideas or address some of these issues. Local communities that are not participating in the co-design and co-delivery process can still benefit from the proposed techniques developed, the recorded reflections (i.e. our visual notebook of reflections) but also the underlying network of community-academic partnerships that this project will create. It is worth noting that people living in communities for which interventions will be designed in Phase 2 will be also indirect beneficiaries of the project. 
 
- Community-based organizations - such as charities, social enterprises, and third sector organizations in general will directly benefit from the project, as they will acquire access to knowledge and innovative ways for building their capacity and extending the reach of their practice using existing assets. This will have an indirect economic benefit as it will allow them to 'achieve more for less', by finding ways to overcome existing limitations in resources through building on the power of the created network. 
 
- Research institutions will benefit from the exploration of how they can extend their reach and impact on the ground. As is the case with community-based organisations, the code of practice will be directly usable in this as well as future projects and collaborations. 
 
- Individuals working with or in communities. This may include co-design practitioners and community leaders that would benefit from the reflections and insights emerging from the process. In the course of the project, the 'Design by Consensus' process will be developed and evaluated for its effectiveness in helping create a shared vision, and bring different stakeholders and interests together. The process will therefore be a further asset that can be used by individuals facilitating co-design and co-production activities. 
 
- Policy-makers within national and local government will benefit from gaining insight into strategies for building capacity by exploiting the interdependencies between communities, community based organizations and research institutions. Successful projects from phase 2 will be valuable case studies and can provide evidence to support policies that foster collaborations between academics, community organisations and local communities. 
 
The project activities and insights are expected to have impact on the social, economic and cultural making of UK communities, on the innovation capacity of community-based organizations and on policy-making in UK. More specifically: 
 
- The project will develop of a set of strategies that aim to help community organizations to build their capacity exploiting their existing assets. This will help foster economic competitiveness of local communities and community-based organizations and as a result contribute to the economic competitiveness of the UK. 
 
- The proposed 'design by consensus process' aims to help uncover and build interconnections and cultural diversity within communities and community-academic partnerships. The project will therefore help mobilize interconnections and cultural diversity of local communities and therefore improve quality of life as people and communities will be better equipped to help each other. 
 
- The project aims to identify a research agenda allowing community-academic partnerships to address social problems or pursue ideas for social change in ways that were not possible before. Through capacity building, the project will therefore support social innovation in community based organizations and policy-making.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99298</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The video describes the Scaling up project, its aims and principles and covers activities and discussions that took place at the project's final dissemination event.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A4CA93B0-5061-40AF-9DDB-08865A0CE67B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video was disseminated to a wider audience at the AHRC Cardiff Festival and the Creative Citizen Conference in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Scaling Up Co-Design Showcase Video</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_AGn_vLkY</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The cascading box can be described as a collaborative cultural probe - that is as a technique for inspiring/sharing ideas, connecting people and collaboratively generating data for supporting design thinking. More specifically, it is a participatory activity of visual and text based story creation based on a box that is passed from one person to another. The box is passed from one person to another with the objective to cascade a message and it involves the collaborative creation of pictures and stories using a camera and postcards provided in the box.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BD3923A-CB46-4B37-8773-743AA6C33A3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The cascading box is a methodological contribution in creative research methods.

The Glass-House in collaboration with project partners Silent Cities, the Open University, Blackwood Foundation and Northumbria University, and with other partners including Lend Lease and Sacred Heart Catholic School, delivered these workshops. A group of twenty Year 10 students were given the opportunity to develop their design and media skills to explore their place and think about the qualities they would like to see in a new open space to be developed in Elephant and Castle. Students not only developed design and media skills, but also improved their analytical, communication and team-working skills, and were empowered to contribute to the future development of their neighbourhood.

Pupils reflected and provided feedback about their experience. The most notable results were: 
- A better understanding and interest on media production and place making (in particular through film and photography)
- An increased confidence and understanding about the value of collaboration in design project
- A better understanding of challenges related to place-making
- An increased understanding of issues around accessibility in cities

Silent Cities and The Glass-House Community Led Design identified an opportunity to support the journalists to explore issues around how place can exclude and include, through a day-long workshop run by The Glass-House. The workshop also involved an interview with a member of Blackwood Foundation's Bespoken network, George Perfect, who gave the journalists his first-hand experience of navigating place with a disability. The journalists went out into the local area armed with various media tools to capture some of the opportunities and challenges of this neighbourhood, before producing and presenting outputs on their sensory and emotional interaction with place.

The Community Journalism and place potential programme had a direct impact on participants confidence and professional development. Most notably, following The Glass-House workshop with the Community Journalists, two Community Journalists - El Veasey and Faiza Omar - worked with Silent Cities' founder Justine Gaubert and members of The Glass-House team to develop and deliver the media training day programme and contributed to the content of a Resource Book, produced by The Glass-House as part of the young people's programme in Elephant and Castle. While they contributed to the work of The Glass-House in London, El and Faiza gained valuable skills and confidence, valuable life and employment skills (El feels that this experience has brought a new level of awareness to her emerging work as an occupational therapist, while for Faiza the experience has shown her London in a new light and further inspired a desire to travel and to live in London), and they have continued to develop as Community Journalists delivering work for Silent Cities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://scalingup-codesign.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/8/5/12856329/scaling-up_booklet_spreads.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1495892</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities and Design Highlight Notice</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/M001709/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>9769A0DB-44BA-4382-9D5B-A58CAD7A3DB7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>99772</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Summit 2013 Development Awards (Legacy Projects)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>AH/L013142/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>D64645F5-74F3-4F59-8F84-1251747AABE4</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5920107</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Fulfilling Lives: Ageing Better</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Big Lottery Fund</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B1C08093-696D-4D19-9E54-144FB3968F6D</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>10200</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Festival 2014: Second Call</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7B08A911-B360-446F-A541-1AA38B6FDE80</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>There is evidence of positive impact on all civil society organizations that took part in the project. The project used a variety of methods to capture the effects of the project activities and outputs on individuals, organisations and their practice. Methods included an audit, interviews, and other tools (like impact maps, questionnaires etc).

- Changes on organizational practices and culture
All partner organizations expressed the view that cross-pollination practices of the project helped them reflect, rethink and develop some of their practices. In certain cases this involved advancing current practice and in some others change of thinking about the use co-design and co-production within the organization. 

- Building an economy
The majority of participating organizations claimed that they improved their capacity to secure new funding because of the created network and practices of this project. Often there was a direct link with a successful outcome (e.g. Sheffield Age Better initiative) or a new funded project. In certain cases this new stream of funding was critical for the viability and development of those of organizations. 

- Building capacity and new partnerships
All partner organizations felt that they 'addressed issues that couldn't address before' or that they 'addressed issues in a more holistic way'. Moreover, some partners claimed that this project helped them built new connections with other civil society organizations but also built their partnership with research institutions. 

- Reaching (more) local communities 
Some project partners claimed that cross-pollination approaches helped them to have bigger impact by reaching or working with more diverse communities and by spreading their practices and outputs to wider audiences. Feedback and interviews carried out with local communities support the view that communities appreciated the quality and diversity of the creative support that was offered. 

Moreover, the propagation of successful practices in more communities has been developed through the generation of 'champions' or 'ambassadors'. An example is a Brunel PhD student who used the approaches of the project and applied them in her own context (designing technology for families), with some mentoring from the research project. 

- Reaching the private and public sector
The project explored the development of connections between civil society organizations with private organizations and the public sector. In particular, there are some indications that the collaboration between local communities, community organizations and private developers could lead to a new collaborative project in the future. A private developer that collaborated in the project expressed the desire to rethink practise and continue working with similar approaches in the future. 

Summary:
All the above results indicate that this project has a demonstrable contribution to civil society and in particular to civil society organizations in UK. Although the number of organizations who benefited (directly or indirectly) is still not very large, it has to be noted the overall economic/social and cultural impact is likely to spread beyond those organizations. That is because the above benefits are propagated to the communities that these organizations support (or are connected to) but also because the network itself is still in operation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>71500B28-3C9E-43D8-91A1-98AAE81437A1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project focussed on co-design practices within civil society organisations, and how these practices and their impact on people and society can be scaled up. This action research project experimented with various ways of 'scaling up co-design' in real situations. The term co-design was used to describe a process where people and civil society groups are sharing the conceptualization and development of ideas through collaborative action and making. The core learning outcomes of the project can be summarised as follows: 

1) Four ways of scaling up: 'Scaling up' has been generally approached as a process of connecting people and organizations with the aim of producing outputs and impacts that couldn't be achieved by those people working alone (e.g. through sharing their skills, expertise or other resources). Against the typical view of scaling up as 'growing bigger', this project experimentally identified four alternative interpretations of scaling up that gave more emphasis on the generation of creative connections between people/organizations and the propagation of practices within this network. More specifically, the project identified the following four ways of scaling up co-design: 
- Scaling up by extending out: This type was exemplified by co-design practices that were developed to form a 'socio-technical infrastructure' that helps reach and connect more people in different geographical places or contexts and allows them to work collaboratively. 
- Scaling up by extending up: This type was exemplified by co-design practices that foster connections and collaborations with policy makers and gatekeepers. 
- Scaling up by spreading practice: This type was exemplified by co-design practices that generate 'champions' or 'ambassadors' that propagate practices within new contexts. 
- Scaling up by connecting: This type was exemplified by co-design practices that are developed by connecting practices, skills and expertise of people and organizations. 

2) The cross-pollination mechanism for scaling up: The project team co-developed and evaluated a mechanism (referred to as cross-pollination) for scaling up co-design. The proposed mechanism was based on the principle of sharing resources and practices through a process of identifying commonalities but also complementarity of resources and skills. 

The proposed model of scaling up through cross-pollination resulted in: 
- A significant increase in the connectivity and size of the original network within a year 
- The generation of new projects or activities that went beyond the timescale of the project 
- The generation of champions that carry out similar practices beyond the confines of the specific research project 

An audit with all the original partners and other evaluation workshops revealed that this project had a positive impact for the involved organizations in terms of their capacity to secure new projects, diversification of their offering, visibility of their projects and reach to more communities. 

For more information see the project website: 
http://scalingup-codesign.weebly.com/project-activities-and-outputs.html</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project developed a model for scaling up co-design practice ('cross-pollination') and created a network of organisations that continue to collaborate with each other. The organisations and individuals involved were able to strengthen their expertise in co-design, develop their confidence and reputation, and put their skills and knowledge at work in new activities and projects (beyond the original project). Examples include the Sheffield Age Better initiative and toolkit, and new collaborative research projects (like the Evaluating Intangible Legacies, and Co-designing Asset Mapping projects).

The practice and resources created (including the scaling up booklet, video, the cascading box and other resources on the project website) can be of use to a range of beneficiaries who are looking to scale up their practice: civil society organizations (e.g. charities, social enterprises); professionals and volunteers working with communities; as well as research institutions. 

The project also hopes to support further exploration of community-academic partnerships aiming to reshape the relation between university and society. One such partnership is currently explored between the Design Group at The Open University and The Glass-House Community Led Design. 

Finally, academic presentations and publications are hoped to contribute to knowledge of co-design practices within different domains (IT, design, media etc).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>814A7ED6-CCDC-423B-9B55-98CAE46E209B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://scalingup-codesign.weebly.com/project-activities-and-outputs.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Academic advisor for DCLG's Our Place program</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1DE621D-B552-4885-B370-EFE5FE8C5063</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The produced evaluation report is the key document providing recommendations in order to shape DCLG policy and Locality strategy aiming to improve local services that respond to local priorities and with reduced cost across the country.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://mycommunity.org.uk/resources/place-evaluation-report-case-studies/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Providing insights to DCLG policy advisors and analysts on community mobilisation and the role of third sector organisations</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A0BFE46-4FD5-4EB9-8076-AD1A7C5CDBAF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Providing insights and advice to the Cabinet Office and the Head of Civil Society Insights Team on policies for community mobilisation (and the role of third sector organisations)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57E023BD-B22B-4DE2-AAE4-FC48C8638561</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Cross pollination is a method for understanding and creating a sharing economy of interests, assets (skills but also material resources) and build shared projects where other people can contribute or benefit from.

The cross-pollination concept and methods thus leveraged almost &amp;pound;6m to tackle isolation among the elderly in Sheffield. The toolkit was shared with organisations across Sheffield who support older people. Over 40 organisations have implemented the co-design based toolkit and 43,000 toolkits will be disseminated reaching an estimate of 12,000 elderly people.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Cross-pollination</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://scalingup-codesign.weebly.com/uploads/1/2/8/5/12856329/scaling-up_booklet_spreads.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Online interface and management system for collaborative working that included:
