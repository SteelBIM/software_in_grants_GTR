There is currently no other monograph which deals with this emerging field in Anglophone postcolonial writing. \n My principle research question is: can postcolonial literary studies engage with the concerns and strategies of contemporary inter-disciplinary discourses on asylum and immigration? I intend to address this in a book-length study of the points of convergence between postcolonial studies and refugee studies. Refugee studies is conceived of here as including the sociology of asylum, but also incorporating debates in ethical philosophy regarding the definition of hospitality; political philosophy and questions of cosmopolitanism and citizenship; legal philosophy and biopolitics; and ethnographic narratives of displacement. \n In the modern 'asylum age', the reassertion of national sovereignty as a response to increased people movement, and the subsequent retraction and redefinition of the right to asylum, indicate that neo-colonial forces are shaping the provision of hospitality and refuge. Globalized economic flows have in many ways superseded physical borders, and the refugee is a spectre of the concomitant loss of sovereignty. In other words, the refugee signifies both the limits of the nation and the exercise of sovereign power at that limit. I therefore intend to examine various discourses in which the refugee is reproduced as a deterritorialized border. \n The book will be organised into four chapters which investigate the strategies that enforce this state of affairs. I will begin by examining the place of the refugee in postcolonial Europe; the first chapter will focus on efforts to define the refugee, and subsequent implications for an ethics of welcoming, by examining the conditionality of hospitality and the fragmentation of labels that describe displacement. Subsequent chapters will examine in turn a series of factors which impinge upon the subjectivity of the refugee. The second chapter will look at the representation of the refugee as voiceless by those who claim to speak for refugees, in relation to the need to narrate or perform a refugee identity. The third chapter follows Giorgio Agamben's theorization of the concentration camp in order to read 'the camp' as a motif of (racial) exclusion in the work of Caryl Phillips. The final chapter will examine how both hospitality and displacement are conditioned by gender.\n This book will engage with a diverse range of forms and contexts of displacement; not just the status of the asylum seeker in postcolonial Europe, but also other contexts of displacement, such as 'the camp' or detention centre in postcolonial Australia and Palestine, narratives of the 'Lost Boys' of Sudan, and irregular or economic migration in post-apartheid South Africa and the contemporary USA.\n Postcolonial studies is by necessity an expanding and adaptable field, responsive to the emergence of new grounds of oppression, and much of the most incisive theory on hospitality and the refugee (e.g. Jacques Derrida; Zygmunt Bauman; Seyla Benhabib) is coming from outside the usual postcolonial-literary channels. I intend therefore to examine how productive intersections with other discourses of displacement can point the way forward for postcolonial studies to engage with the concerns of the asylum age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24558</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Making it Home project used some of the insights from Postcolonial Asylum, to bring together refugee and non-refugee women from Edinburgh and Glasgow to reflect on the concept of home, and to produce a series of short films on the subject.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA125C64-E569-43D2-99C2-51CA8E443C0A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Making it Home', a series of poetry reading and film-making workshops with 10 asylum seeker and refugee women in Glasgow and 7 local women in Edinburgh, has contributed to widening access of disenfranchised groups to cultural resources in Scotland and to the political process.

They met for a final joint session to discuss their respective experiences of home and of poetry. They then attended a series of film-making workshops in which they made four short films based on one of the poems included in the workshop. There were screened at various venues around Edinburgh and Glasgow during Scottish Refugee week 2013, including at the Scottish Parliament. Circa 350 people attended screenings and talks about the films.

The participants benefited from increased confidence; awareness of cultural resources; developing new skills; and developing an increased shared understanding between a different communities.
The project partners (Refugee Survival Trust; Pilton Community Health Project; Maryhill Integration Network, University of Edinburgh) benefited from the opportunity to work together and develop new ways to meet their respective remits. RST, for example, had never used a creative project such as Making it Home, to meet their core aims. 
Members of the public benefited from an increased awareness about the difficulties facing asylum seeker and refugee women.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://makingithome.net/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012,2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Speaker - Migration, Asylum and Detention in Lampedusa: Discussing Research, Policies and Narratives (4 July 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F364EFD9-E88E-480F-B12C-FF198E0C0950</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This symposium was designed as a discussion-led event to engage both academia, the general public and refugee participants in a conversation about the disquieting and extremely pressing issues of detention, migration and asylum in the context of Lampedusa, recently identified as a HOTSPOT by the European Commission (See EU Hotspot Approach). The aim was to discuss and investigate the current EU and local policies governing the illegal detention of hundreds of asylum seekers who managed to reach the coast of Lampedusa in southern Italy during the past few months. Planned as a &amp;quot;bottom-up&amp;quot; event aiming to enable refugees into a position of legitimacy, the occasion provided space for refugees to voice their stories about both the crossing and the inhuman conditions of detention in Lampedusa.

In the book I made the following key findings:
1. That the heritage of ideas available in postcolonial modes of critique can be applied to the situation of seeking asylum, but that this must be done with particular limits in mind. The refugee is a 'scandal' for postcolonial studies in that the displacement experienced by refugees and asylum seekers is not accounted for in postcolonial writing that celebrates cosmopolitanism.
2. That the term 'camp dispositif' (a compound of the theories of Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben) can describe the kinds of exclusionary structures and processes that control refugees' access to sanctuary. The 'camp dispositif' refers to the apparatus (technical, discursive, legal, etc) that construct a political relation of exclusion that Agamben traces through the history of the detention camp.
3. That writing by asylum seekers and refugees, in particular, often dramatises this exclusion, by adopting a 'bare life' status that makes visible the restrictions of the camp dispositif.
4. That engaging with this writing can result in new understandings of political identity and belonging can come, where it encourages readers and audiences to enter into acts of substitution (imaginative and representational) that challenge the practices of exclusion implicit in proclamations of belonging (and the difficulty of saying 'we'). As such, the book advocates a more reciprocal, ethically-led response to the situation of asylum seekers and refugees.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The key findings in my research will be of particular interest to groups using literature and visual culture to connect with refugees and non-refugee audiences.
