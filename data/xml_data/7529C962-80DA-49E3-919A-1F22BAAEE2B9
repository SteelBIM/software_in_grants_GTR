The project will support visits of British researchers to Chinese cities that are experimenting with health and welfare system reforms and participate in workshops with Chinese researchers and policy-makers to discuss lessons emerging from the Chinese experience and from the experiences of other countries. It will also support visits of Chinese researchers to the UK to collaborate with British researchers, learn lessons from the experiences of the British health and welfare system and develop collaborative links with researchers from other rapidly developing middle-income countries. 

It will also support the participation of Chinese researchers in meetings with policy analysts from other countries experiencing rapid economic, social and demographic change. The main outputs will be publications in academic journals, policy briefs for decision-makers and the development of a programme of research and mutual learning on adapting health and welfare services to contexts of rapid change. The outputs of this project and the subsequent research programme will enable policy makers and policy analysts in low and middle-income countries to draw on lessons from the experiences of China and other rapidly developing countries as they address similar challenges in their health and welfare sectors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The purpose of this partnership is to encourage mutual learning between policy makers and researchers on the changing role of government in the health and welfare sectors in contexts of rapid economic and social change. Key target audiences are outlined below:

Chinese policy makers at city and national level
The Institute of Sociology of the Chinese Academy of Social Science (IoS) is working with the governments of several cities to test experimental approaches for providing access to basic health and welfare services. These experiments are in specific localities within the cities. The city governments have the capacity to take lessons from successful experiments to scale. 

The National Ministry of Civil Affairs and the National Health and Family Planning Commission are responsible for national health and welfare policies. They draw on the findings from this kind of experimental intervention in developing implementation guidelines. The members of the IoS team write regular reports to these Ministries. Also, some of them sit on a national advisory body on ageing. 

The UK Department of Health and the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission have agreed to collaborate on a number of issues, including strategies for addressing the problems of an ageing population. They meet regularly to review progress. This project will support this collaboration.

Chinese researchers on health, welfare and urban sustainability
There is a substantial multi-disciplinary community of Chinese researchers working on the reform of the health and welfare sectors in a context of rapid urbanisation. The partnership will organise two workshops in Beijing for the local research and policy community. The aim is to stimulate new ways of thinking about ways to address the emerging challenges with health, welfare and sustainability. One purpose of the workshops will be to encourage the production and publication of papers to be published in both Chinese and international journals. We will reach the national research community through these papers.

Policy-makers and policy analysts in other rapidly growing middle-income countries
There is a growing interest amongst policy analysts and policy makers in the rapidly growing middle-income countries, including China, in the lessons from the experiences of other countries facing similar challenges in meeting health and welfare needs in contexts of urbanisation and rapid economic, social and demographic change. However, there are few forums for this kind of mutual learning. We will engage this community by providing opportunities for individual researchers to establish collaborative links and through the regional hubs of the STEPS Centre and the network of policy analysts to which the IDS Centre of the Rising Powers in Global Development is linked. We will produce a policy brief aimed at this target audience and will also reach them through academic publications.

Global policy-makers and researchers
We will organise a panel discussion at the conference on States and Markets in Development, planned for IDS's 50th anniversary celebrations in the summer of 2016 as a contribution to international debates on the changing role of government in health and welfare systems. The partnership will also seek out external opportunities such as the annual BRICS summit and the implementation phase in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals agenda to engage around their research findings. We will also publish journal articles and/or a book internationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>132097</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>NHS Brighton and Hove CCG</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration between Brighton City Council and the Brighton Clinical Commissioning Group and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences</gtr:description><gtr:id>35818C3B-DC78-43C1-A1E4-5C3BB4846A38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The researchers from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have produced Chinese language briefing notes to share with their partners in Chinese cities.
