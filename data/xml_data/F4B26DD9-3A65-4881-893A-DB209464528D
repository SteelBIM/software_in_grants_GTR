Its core remit is to maintain a ?safe setting? so users can access the confidential census and administrative data held in the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study (NILS), whilst protecting the anonymity of individuals, and to support users from making research applications through data extraction and analysis, to the clearance of final outputs.Beyond this, the NILS-RSU also aims to promote the research and policy use of the NILS by the development of a research agenda in cooperation with its users and through outreach and dissemination to policymakers inside and outside government.A special focus is the linkage of 2011 Census data to the NILS which will permit analyses of ?Northern Ireland in Transition 2001-2011?.The work future programme also recognises the changing external environment by looking to other UK longitudinal studies and ESRC investments for economies of scale in user training and the promotion of longitudinal research, in developing remote access protocols for users, in widening the user base, and in exploring and meeting the aspiration for a UK-wide longitudinal study.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on policy and outreach to research audiences have been part of the NILS-RSU remit since its inception. As part of the project design process users must include comments on both potential dissemination groups and implications for policy. The NILS Research Approvals Group (RAG) approval of projects takes account of these aspects. This is because the NILS receives funding from the NI Executive (and they also support an RSU support officer) and this ensures an emphasis on policy and, more generally, the NILS relationship with government. Where possible, projects are planned to impact with policymakers and the public. Examples include research on: suicide in NI; religion and health outcomes (both O'Reilly &amp;amp; Rosato); breast screening (Kinnear et al); fertility (McGregor &amp;amp; McKee); dental activity (Telford); antibiotic prescribing patterns (Johnston &amp;amp; Rosato); accuracy of address information from the healthcare system (Barr &amp;amp; Shuttleworth); and migration and residential segregation (Shuttleworth, Barr &amp;amp; Gould). The RSU produces Research Briefs (summarising published NILS research) and this helps maintain the relationship with government. The forthcoming challenge is to deepen this impact by increasing the range and quality of NILS projects and reaching out to new audiences. 

The proposal plans to do this in four main ways. 
Firstly, a programme of research developed around the 2001-2011 Census Link. This is loosely organised around the NI '2011 Programme for Government' and includes current (or prospective) research audiences from government, the NI Assembly, other public bodies and the voluntary sector. It involves building relationships with the academic research community and other research bodies. As part of this, it is planned (with support from funders) to raise the profile by using beta testing projects for the NILS 2001-2011 Census link to engage with experienced and early career researchers and produce a landmark edited book - 'NI in Transition 2001-2011'. This will both generate impact and broaden the user base. 

Secondly, in cooperation with other LS SUs, to improve the NILS profile both internationally and in the UK. This will be done by creating a stronger web presence and joint promotion of the value of the databases. This should also facilitate an expansion of collaborative research between NI and non-NI based researchers. 

Thirdly, the RSU will work to increase NILS impact by making the project specification process more easily managed, to enhance facilities for 'remote' access to NILS data, and to extend data linkages to the NILS. To this end, we see the creation of synthetic NILS datasets to assist researchers to develop analyses, and the exploration of data sharing via secure technologies, as longer-term mechanisms for increasing impact. Likewise, increased coverage and data linkage is part of the long-term strategic vision. A particular feature of the NILS is the linkage of non-standard administrative datasets, allowing Distinct Linkage Projects (DLPs) to be undertaken. Examples of these (some noted above) include breast screening data, dental activity data, electronically captured prescription data, and GP Practice level data. These mean that the RSU is developing expertise in the linkage of administrative data, something likely to increase in strategic importance after the 2001-2011 link. This expertise can be pooled with other the UK LS and also with all UK statistical agencies as well as the UKDS. 

Finally, the NILS-RSU is committed to partnership with users and other organisations in NI, and sees this as a key way to increase the impact of the NILS and its research. An example of this is the contribution made to the planning and organisation of a one-day conference to be held in May 2012 on 'Beyond the 2011 Census' which draws in international speakers as well as the UK statistical agency. Continuing such activity is very much part of RSU forward planning.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1099703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introduction to Multilevel Modeling</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEFFE579-C5D0-4D1E-AF78-CAD3B75425F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop in November 2014 was designed to introduce current and potential NILS users to multilevel modelling.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>LS Roadshow - Glasgow</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>186DCE88-1E0E-4496-A5FA-DAB4C1C63F85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was part of a series of roadshows to take the longitudinal studies 'on the road' to reach audiences that had not been reached by earlier promotional events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An introduction to the new Census 2011 data.
