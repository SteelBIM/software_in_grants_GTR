1763-1833</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J017736/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project examines the nature and significance of Caribbean slave-ownership in the formation of Britain in the crucial coincident years of the peak of the slave-economy and a decisive period in the industrialisation of Britain. It develops a history of the ownership of the 4,000 estates in the British West Indian colonies between 1763 and the end of slavery in 1834. It identifies those estate-owners and families who resided in or returned to Britain and constructs a prosopography of these slave-owners, tracing their commercial, political, social and cultural presence and impact in Britain.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project develops an integrated analysis of the impact of slave-ownership on the shaping of the British nation and utilises the new data to re-examine the relationship between Empire, slavery and early imperial Britain in the late C18 and early C19.&lt;br />&lt;br />The project will create a new public resource which will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>codify and make searchable the ownership and evolution of estates in the British Caribbean between 1763 and 1833&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>trace the major commercial, political, institutional and cultural legacies of the slave-owners resident in Britain&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>allow users to link estate-ownership with other extant records on enslaved people, notably the Slave Registers. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We believe that high-quality research conducted to the highest standards of historical rigour is essential to provide a shared and dependable empirical base of information for all the parties who have a stake in the history of slavery and its relationship to modern Britain. Firms; institutions; families and individuals who are among the successor firms or descendants of beneficiaries of slave-ownership; pressure groups; community representatives and individual descendants of the enslaved; governments and policy-makers in the Caribbean, Africa and Europe; and public institutions such as museums, galleries and schools: all of these are involved in some shape or form in a series of dialogues about the social, cultural, political and commercial implications of British colonial slavery. Without a shared basis of knowledge, it will be impossible for these parties to engage with each other fully or fruitfully. Recovering the histories of slave-ownership and capturing associated information on the enslaved people therefore have value for wider society in Britain. We believe that we can contribute both to the effectiveness of the existing efforts of many organisations and to the realisation of new efforts to mobilise around the issues and problems arising in Britain from the historic nexus of race and slavery.

Firms and institutions with historic roots in the period of slavery will benefit from access to rigorous empirical data on the involvement or otherwise of predecessor firms. The Royal Bank of Scotland, for example, has already amended its regulatory filings in Chicago to take account of findings from our existing project and we expect to submit substantial new information to all the major British banks from the new project.

The recovery by groups of local and regional researchers of the histories of connections to slavery and their impact on specific sites and areas was an important fruit of the efforts around the 2007 bicentenary commemorations. We provide a means of helping to sustain and renew those community efforts. We have experience of using our work to strengthen existing networks and stimulate the creation of new ones among these communities of researchers and activists, and we are committed to sustaining these processes through the new project. Our work lends itself to an unusual degree to the generation of spin-off smaller-scale research projects specific to particular towns, areas or neighbourhoods. In the course of our engagement work to disseminate awareness of the current British Slave Ownership project, we have been asked repeatedly for data and help on slave-owners and slave-ownership in the decades prior to 1833.

The project will both provide information to and represent an outlet for the work of the myriad of family historians engaged in locating themselves relative to the past. We are one of the few projects working consciously to bridge the gap between academic history and these broader constituencies with appetite for knowledge of methodologies and approaches. As such, we will work alongside institutions such as The National Archives to target high priority outreach groups. Bodies such as English Heritage, committed to producing histories of their properties that are transparent on linkages to slavery, have drawn and will continue to draw on our work. Our results will be available to museums and galleries who are also struggling to mediate between academic research and the demands of public display.

In the Caribbean, both academic and non-academic audiences have been alienated from much European scholarship on slavery. We represent an opportunity to re-engage with these constituencies, including in the public sphere, to create a basis for renewed dialogue on the colonial period.

Schools in Britain are concerned to bring immediacy to their teaching of history, and we will offer the opportunity of tailored materials for Key Stage 3 modules on slavery and empire.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1261158</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hackney Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Local Roots / Global Routes</gtr:description><gtr:id>C675C6D2-A655-4295-B455-280FAB7AE32A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Teaching Resource Pack that includes teacher's notes, student's lessons, and film.

The students have been studying 'The Rape of the Lock' by Alexander Pope. Pope's poem is particularly interested in the rise of consumer society in the early eighteenth century. The text is permeated with anxiety about role of empire and trade and its impact on British society. The presence of the 'various off'rings of the world' - in the form of both elaborate objects and increasingly common forms of consumables e.g. coffee and tea - are indicative of the ways in which the empire was returning back to Britain. The context of both slavery and colonialism are vital for an understanding of the poem. As a cultural historian literary texts are an important part of the work of reconnecting with past societies and the ways in which they made sense of their world. Historicising the text for the students enabled them to gain new perspectives on Pope and his world of objects.

The teacher commented that the enrichment aspect in terms of cross-disciplinary context was excellent.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Parliament and slave-ownership (Nick Draper, 12/06/2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCF5352D-29B0-41DB-9EB9-03D272109EAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture at the Houses of Parliament with an audience of 65-70 associated with the display of the Making Freedom exhibition inside the Houses of Parliament.

Talk drew on the work of the LBS and other current work on slavery and abolition, making connections with the preoccupations of historical geographers. The focus was on the meanings of slavery and freedom in the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century British Empire. These were terms which were widely utilised but whose meanings were both geographically and historically specific. Who was free to do what, where? How was white freedom in the Caribbean marked as different from that of the metropole? What was the relationship between slavery and other forms of unfree labour? Extensive use was made of the writings of slave-owners and their descendants and the part they played in the racial mapping and re-mapping of empire.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://conference.rgs.org/ICHG/37</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>New perspectives on slaveries in the African world.

As a result of their work, all six students made valuable contributions to the LBS database, a publicly available historical resource. They also produced a blog about their week. They made the most of an opportunity to talk with the department's Undergraduate Tutor about their UCAS statements and about the resources available to undergradauates (academic, financial and welfare-related).
The whole week was about the students asking questions, taking part in debates and challenging their own perceptions of an interesting period in British history and all the students engaged fully with the work.

The week resulted in requests for further reading and further research from three of the students and a continued commitment to collaborate with work.
All of the students said they were interested in studying history at university and had learned a lot more about the whole university experience.

To this end, we have implemented a public engagement strategy which can be viewed in more detail in the 'Engagement activities' outcomes section and will only be summarised here.

The widest reach has been through television. LBS research was the backbone of Britain's Forgotten Slave-owners, a two-part programme made by the LBS team in conjunction with the BBC, which was shown on BBC2 in the summer of 2015. The programmes won the inaugural RHS Public History prize for broadcasting, the BAFTA for best specialist factual programme, and were nominated for the Royal Television Society's history prize. The programmes reached a combined audience of 3 million people in Britain (and have been distributed worldwide), sparking a national discussion of Britain's past involvement in slavery. Reviewers summarised the impact in glowing terms: in the Daily Mail (16 July 2016), for example, &amp;quot;Last night's documentary was truly jaw-dropping in its revelations. David Olusoga and his team deserve huge credit for their research and this film, which was as important and informative as it was disturbing&amp;quot; (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3163231/How-Britain-s-middle-class-mint-abolishing-slavery-Claudia-Connell-reviews-night-s-TV.html). Reviewers noted that a study of the past can enhance our understanding of the present: the Guardian (23 July 2015), for example, described the programmes as &amp;quot;a thoughtful, thorough, unswerving guide to how slavery was abolished, but the underlying ideas and attitudes endure&amp;quot; (https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/23/britains-forgotten-slave-owners-review).

LBS followed up using other media, giving interviews to radio stations, online magazines and newspapers. LBS contributed to an iWonder guide on the BBC website (http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zw8dq6f) giving guidance on how people could explore the subject in more depth. Our use of the media to encourage public debate has been consistent throughout the life of the LBS project; for example, an article about our newly extended database published in the Independent 25 September 2016 has been 'shared' over 9,400 times and attracted 715 comments (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/24/slave-owning-families-influenced-uk-jane-austen-modern-rroyalty-eugenie-beatrice). Catherine Hall wrote an article for the Guardian on the same day connecting historical slavery with modern hate crimes; the article has been 'shared' 6,800 times and attracted over 400 comments (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/racist-ideas-slavery-slave-owners-hate-crime-brexit-vote). 

To enhance the reach and significance of the project's impact on public awareness and debate, members of the LBS team have spoken to very many diverse organisations and groups about the project and its work. For example, in autumn 2015 we organised day-long workshops in Exeter, Glasgow, Manchester and Nottingham and in autumn 2016 we held two events in London with a combined audience of 500 people. The emphasis in our workshops has been on local and regional history, tailoring our work to the interests of local people. Through these workshops we have stimulated and helped sustain networks of independent local historians.

LBS has formed a partnership with the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography to secure a more adequate representation of slave-ownership in the ODNB. Some three dozen new entries have been commissioned and completed, and hundreds of existing entries reviewed and where necessary revised.

A very substantial impact is achieved by our online database, launched on 28 February 2013 and greatly extended in September 2016. Crucial to its success is its accessibility and usability for the general public. Visitors to the site can search for individuals by surname, forename, age, address, religion, occupation, by level of wealth, by size of slave-ownership, by colony and estate name for each holding or by an open search of the freeform notes - and therefore easily access the data according to the users' wide variety of interests. The extension in September 2016 added thousands more slave-owners and gave information on the histories of over 8,000 estates in the British Caribbean between 1740 and 1834. The extension included 19th century maps of Jamaica, Grenada and Barbados with modern satellite overlays linked to estates in our database, allowing users a new 'way in' to our data. The viewing figures for our website provide evidence that our publicity drive is increasingly effective. Between the launch of the website on 28 February 2013 and 20 December 2016 we have had 872,361 visits from 594,873 users in 226 countries or territories. A little under one-third (31.7%) of users return to the site.

LBS has assisted, and in turn been assisted by, hundreds of family historians in their research. The level of email correspondence, primarily from descendants of slave-owners and the enslaved, continues to increase. In 2013 we were receiving between 2 and 5 emails a week with research from members of the public; in 2016 the average has been more than 10 a week. In 2013 and 2014 we added to our website 330 slave-owners' biographies with information contributed by members of the public; in 2015 and 2016 we added a further 700 publicly-assisted entries. Many emails have resulted in a long-term relationships with LBS providing sources and suggestions to individual correspondents. The LBS project has not only made its research available to large numbers of people through a wide range of media but helped thousands of non-academics to conduct their own historical investigations. We also produce a monthly newsletter distributed to over 500 people with news of upcoming events and updates to our database.

We have been working with schools and colleges to assist in an understanding of slave-ownership. LBS has completed a pioneering partnership with Hackney Museum and with two Hackney schools in the Global Routes/Local Roots project, both having a significant impact on the learning of specific groups of current students and establishing a body of experience as a template for future collaboration. The project website contains resources for teachers comprising background notes, lesson plans, an image gallery, glossary and film (https://lrgr14.wordpress.com/resources/teaching-resources/).

Finally, LBS has helped shape or intervened in a number of public policy and political debates. The work of LBS has been taken up in the debates over reparations, with extensive use of our work by the Chairman of the CARICOM Reparations Commission Sir Hilary Beckles in his Britain's Black Debt (UWI Press, Mona, Jamaica 2013) and elsewhere. The launch of our Phase 2 database stimulated an important Editorial in The Observer 25/09/2016 (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/25/slavery-database-britain-must-take-responsibility). We have contributed a section to the Runnymede Trust's Our Migration Story site (http://www.ourmigrationstory.org.uk/about.html), primarily an education resource but also promoting a wider social and policy agenda. The LBS team intervened in the controversy over anti-Semitism in the Labour Party with an open letter in The Observer 05/06/2016 (http://www.pressreader.com/uk/the-observer1702/20160605/282342564103073) concerning the alleged role of Jews in the slave-trade and slavery.

The work of LBS has succeeded in making the legacies of slave-ownership a topic of engaged and informed public debate, with an impact on national memory and, through this, the way we view ourselves.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CB0916FA-E5D9-47D9-9F0D-6F7DAF77851F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We have developed for the first time a history of slave-ownership throughout the British Caribbean, tracing the evolution of ownership estate-by-estate in the second half of the long 18thC. In researching and assembling this, we have created a major new digital resource, to be released in September 2016, making available for the first time systematic data from the Slave Registers (c. 1815-1834) for all the Caribbean colonies and, for Jamaica, from the Crop Accounts (1740-1803 and the Jamaica Almanacs (1809-1839). We have recorded and analysed some 8000 estates, and identified an estimated 5000 new absentee slave-owners and their legacies in metropolitan Britain. Our systematic data will provide a basis for comparative study of the structure and development of ownership between different colonies and for the contextualisation of locally-specific studies. 
2. Our empirical research and the new knowledge of the thousands of legacies of slave-ownership that we have identified and contextualised are likely to make it impossible for academic historians to write the history of Britain in the long 18th century in future without some engagement with the role of slave-ownership in the formation of modern Britain. We can demonstrate an important flow of wealth from slave-ownership into Britain's commercial, physical and cultural fabric, document the place of slave-owners in Britain's political, social and cultural elites, and show the significance of the slave-owners of the 18thC and early 19thC in moulding notions of 'race'. We have traced the importance of family networks and gendered patterns in the transmission of thousands of estates, and uncovered the stories of hundreds of people of colour in 'outside' families in this period. 
3. We have helped initiate and shape a public discussion and debate in Britain over the role of slave-ownership in Britain's history, conducted on television, on radio, and in the national, regional and local press. We have established close partnerships with individual institutions that help shape the national narrative in Britain, notably the ODNB. Our work has been taken up by governments and policy-makers in the context of the discussions over reparations. We have received a number of awards, including the Royal Historical Society's inaugural Public History prize for broadcasting and the History Today Digital History award for 2015. 
4. We have succeeded in embedding the work of LBS in a new Centre at UCL, in order to sustain the investment made in the first two phases of our project by the ESRC and the ESRC/AHRC. This will be funded by UCL and by the Hutchins Center at Harvard. The Centre will sustain the core work of the LBS project and will provide an anchor for further discretely-funded national and international projects drawing on the networks we have established with local researchers and historians in Britain, and with counterparts in the Netherlands, France and the US.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As noted, we are committed to sustain the core work of LBS at UCL for at least 5 years, and in that period we will be mining our findings ourselves in a series of planned articles and monographs. In addition, and as importantly, all our data will be made publicly accessible in searchable form in September 2016. We know that the new dataset will support new specialist academic work by historians of Caribbean nations; it will form the basis of new doctoral theses in Britain; it will continue to feed into new work by established scholars of Britain, as it already has [e.g. Roderick Floud on Capability Brown and Repton]; it will be an invaluable resource for family and local historians; and it will inform public policy debates on reparations and restitution. The work done by LBS project members with local schools and Hackney Museum in the Global Routes/Local Roots project represents a template to be rolled out across other London boroughs and in the longer-term nationally.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>083C49AB-0009-49EE-986F-B9AA1689F1BC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ucl.ac.uk/lbs</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A database of all the claims for compensation submitted following the Emancipation Act of 1834 (c. 40,000 claims) and the names of the individuals connected to these claims (c. 47,000 individuals) with more detailed biographical information on those individuals we have identified as living in Britain from the mid-1830s onwards (c. 3,000 individuals).</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E440439-3397-4528-BD28-FB5268355468</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We undertook a major publicity campaign in February 2013 to alert people to the publication of our online database.

In the past 18 months we have received over 700 emails about our database from members of the public; each email has been answered by us and has often led to a long correspondence and sharing of information.
