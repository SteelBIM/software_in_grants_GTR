Datasafe</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L011840/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Today, 'Big' customer retail market data are created in many areas, including grocery retailing, energy, health and wellbeing, insurance, mobile communications and retail banking. Analysis of such sources can offer many new insights into contemporary lifestyles.The vision of the Retail Business Datasafe (RBDS) is to create a service that will open up the data resources routinely collected by the retail business sector to academic research, training and capacity building. The public face of the work will be the ESRC Consumer Data Research Centre (CDRC), which will be developed in association with the Leeds University Consumer Data Research Support Service.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>RBDS will also conduct a full and novel range of related Big Data research training and capacity building activities, developed in close association with the retail industry.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>RBDS will provide focus for ESRC's interests in the retail sector and its commitments to capacity building in relation to Big Data research skills. It will also develop a wider service role for other social science research that will benefit from the availability of consumer data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>RBDS is a collaboration between University College London, the University of Liverpool and the University of Oxford.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>RBDS will establish an unique and internationally leading collaboration with the retail sector. This will benefit anyone who needs retail data for their research activities, whether interested in the form and function of the retail sector itself (INTERNAL IMPACT) or its wider impacts upon society, for example in health, planning, transport, education provision or policing (EXTERNAL IMPACT).

Academics working in geography, planning, political science, civil engineering/transport, psychology, social medicine, economics or sociology will use the RBDS as their first port of call when needing to source reliable, frequently updated and comprehensive 'Big' retail data of known and acceptable provenance. This will facilitate a step change in the volume and quality of empirical research about retailing and establish UK leadership in this collaborative endeavour.

The best retail data centre in the world will be of obvious benefit to the retail industry, which is worth &amp;pound;300 billion to the UK annually and employs 1 in 9 working people. Benefits will accrue to large and small (SME) retailers alike that access RBDS facilities. These benefits will be augmented where retail businesses enter into collaborative research with academics in different disciplines: this will become much more of a norm with heightened awareness of academic interests in the wake of RBDS outreach activities.

The retail sector is an integral element of a vibrant and fair society. World-leading retail data provision will also benefit users in local and central government, third sector organisations, the NHS, transport companies, law enforcement, and education and training who need to factor in retail's influences upon individual behaviour and lifestyle. Through the supply of the best data to end users in these sectors, RBDS will have wide economic and societal impacts upon planning for retail provision. Likely impacts will include: better understanding the contribution of the retail sector for health and wll-being; improving the effectiveness of public service delivery at the local, regional and national levels; developing energy conservation initiatives; influencing public policy towards the retail sector, nurturing its recovery and contributing to national wealth creation; developing new thinking about the role of the retail sector in urban regeneration and land use change; and rethinking the ways in which third sector and other organisations can use the retail sector to the common good. 

The internationally leading service products created by RBDS will develop new knowledge through research in quantitative methods, specifically in establishing the provenance of Big Data and their linkage to official, administrative and social media sources. The international link with best practices in the U.S. will ensure that the impacts of these methodological develoments is felt far beyond the UK. 

The predominantly quantitative nature of datasets produced will increase UK capacity in quantitative methods and Big Data analytics, and make this increased capacity more relevant to the needs of the retail industry. At the undergraduate level, RBDS data will reinforce the activities of the Nuffield/ESRC Q-Step centres (including that based at UCL). Continuation of the highly successful Retail Research Masters industrial collaborations will further develop postgraduate training capacity. Channeling resources into the multidisciplinary DTC cohorts at Liverpool and UCL will establish retailing as a prominent ingredient in Ph.D. programmes for the first time in the UK. The programme of short courses will help inculcate quantitative analysis skills that are relevant in recruitment to the retail industry (e.g. retail insight and management) as well as the academic and research sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6728977</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A calendar of 14 CDRC maps and research visualisations created to promote the CDRC service particularly to local authorities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BBA0EF62-41D0-40A1-8670-95F725273F9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This calendar was sent to 400 local authority Chief Execs (200) data partners, prospective data partners and other key contacts, to promote CDRC Maps and CDRC data.

The CDRC has achieved sustained success in opening up consumer data that are predominantly sourced from business, to a broad yet diverse base of users in academia, local government, business and the public. Core to this mission is its web portal. As of February 28 2017, the data store (data.cdrc.ac.uk) has attracted 31,341 unique visitors, delivered 268,929 page views, and registered 4,099 users with 69,539 downloads of open data, while CDRC Maps (maps.cdrc.ac.uk) has attracted 102,115 unique visitors and 164,402 page views.
 
The CDRC's annual national programme of industry Masters dissertation projects, the Masters Research Dissertation Programme, has grown year on year, with (as of October 2016) a total of 31 projects being completed in partnership with a wide range of industrial partners. A further 18 projects are currently (March 2017) ongoing for completion by the end of summer 2017. A number of students have gone on to undertake Ph.D. research (some developing their Masters projects with the same industrial partners), CDRC research internships or full time employment with the industrial partner. The University of Manchester Q-Step programme has modelled its work placement scheme on this programme.
 
Collaborative research under the grant's Service Linked Research Projects with Data Partners are producing results which are not only cutting edge in research terms, but are also of value to collaborating industrial partners in strategic applications and 'horizon scanning' activities. Examples include:
1. Appliances Online delivery data have been used to inform and refine business and logistics planning;
2. Analysis of smart meter data sourced from a major domestic energy provider have been used to profile how different types of households use energy. The research has helped to identify households that experience 'fuel poverty' and conversely, those that appear to make excessive use of energy. These findings have been fed into energy savings initiatives.
3. Analysis of the loyalty card data of a high street retailer has been used to highlight apparent anomalies in shopping behavior, traced in many instances to erroneous or unlikely cardholder address information. This work is of value to store based marketing initiatives.
 
CDRC products are being used by many stakeholders for a wide range of purposes. Examples include: Transport for London's use of the London Output Area Classification as a component of its customer behaviour segmentation; the use of CDRC Mapping technology in the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation's mapping tool http://simd.scot/); and use of CDRC maps in A-Level revision guides (Pearson and Oxford University Press) and Open University teaching materials.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E792805B-53C2-41E9-AF34-580893144A18</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The creation and maintenance of a three tier data service from a range of Big Data and other sources</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Co-sponsorship of research projects and end use in the business, government and local authority sectors</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>35E3F764-2E32-4459-A602-9C9D2E6DD079</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.cdrc.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK Open Data Mission to Taiwan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C09EF91-08C5-4954-9608-D21E40AADAB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In order to further strengthen exchanges and practical collaborations between the UK and Taiwan, the UK's Open Data Institute (ODI) is leading a six-member mission to Taiwan on 18 March to 20 March.
