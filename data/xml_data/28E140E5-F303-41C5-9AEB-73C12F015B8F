In order to address this challenge, the UK has set an ambitious target of 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Meeting this target will require not only decarbonising energy supply, but will also mean action to make the use of energy more efficient and to reduce energy demand. The proposed Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand will contribute to this challenge by developing an interdisciplinary understanding of the emergence, diffusion and impact of low-energy innovations - new technologies, organisational arrangements or modes of behaviour that are expected to improve energy efficiency and/or reduce energy demand.

The Centre will be managed within the Sussex Energy Group (SEG) at SPRU, University of Sussex. SEG has a strong international reputation for policy-relevant interdisciplinary research on transitions to sustainable energy systems, focusing on both the supply and demand sides of these systems. Oxford University's Transport Studies Unit (TSU), a leading interdisciplinary research centre on transport futures, will also contribute to the Centre.

The Centre's research and user engagement will be organised under three themes that focus on the emergence, diffusion and impact of different types of low-energy innovation. Each theme will encompass several research projects that provide a balanced coverage of research methodologies and empirical domains. The Centre will also conduct cross-cutting projects and integration activities, with the aim of synthesising the emerging findings from the three main research themes and effectively engaging stakeholders. Two cross cutting projects are proposed. The first will carry out a comparison of multiple low energy innovations to explore differences between incremental and radical innovations, and between those that are mainly technical and those that are largely social. The second will analyse synergies and trade-offs between policies to support low energy innovations and other, overlapping energy policies. A Low Energy Innovation Studio will also be established as the engagement hub of the Centre. It will oversee a number of functions including researcher placements in collaborating organisations, Centre workshops and events, visiting fellowships, summer schools and a final conference.

The proposed research programme is inter-disciplinary, combining perspectives from different traditions within economics, innovation studies, political science and sociology. The programme will be developed and conducted in collaboration with non-academic organisations who will help identify research problems, contribute resources and case studies, and assist in engagement with practitioners. Centre researchers will collaborate with academic colleagues in the UK as well as with related international institutions. The Centre will produce a range of outputs tailored to different audiences including journal articles, reports and policy briefings. It will have a simple internal management structure, comprising a Director, Centre Manager and three research theme leaders, together with Advisory Group to steer its work. Finally it will develop research capacity by recruiting and developing junior researchers and by encouraging applications from doctoral researchers who would be associated with the Centre.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre's research is of significant relevance to a range of audiences, including policy makers concerned with the development of effective policy approaches to address climate change and other energy policy concerns, academics involved in research in related fields (including energy policy, energy systems, innovation systems, economics and political science) and civil society more broadly (including the general public, and the third and private sectors). Achieving a substantial share of the UK's planned 80% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 through energy demand reduction and energy efficiency will require actions by a variety of stakeholders including companies, policy makers, households and community groups.

The Centre will pursue a variety of avenues to maximise its impact. It will combine a number of activities to engage with both academic and non-academic stakeholders, including public sector officials, community and non-profit organisations, companies as well as the wider public.

The academic impact of the Centre will be achieved by:
- writing high quality working papers and peer reviewed publications;
- giving presentations at conferences, seminars and workshops;
- active involvement in national and international research networks;
- hosting academic visitors; and
- organising two summer schools for PhD students.

The conventional approach is for non academic 'users' of research to be presented with findings at the end of a research process with which they have had no involvement. They are then expected to understand the relevance and/or change their practice as a result. The Centre will move beyond this, and will maximise impacts on relevant user groups by engaging them through carefully tailored engagement processes before, during and after the research. These engagement processes will be managed through the Centre's Low Energy Innovation Studio. The activities of the Studio will include:
- engage a variety of stakeholders through the Centre's biannual Advisory Group; 
- working with a number of partners on specific projects (incl. energy utility SSE, Brighton and Hove City Council, Oxfordshire County Council, Transport for London, The Discovery Mill, Simply Connect Ltd);
- providing interested stakeholders with short-term placements of academics in their organisations and hosting non-academic visitors; 
- organising workshops and events targeted at stakeholders, either during the research process or to disseminate results; and
- co-hosting specific workshops for energy management practitioners from public and private organisations with The Discovery Mill.

The Centre aims to make specific impacts on policy making processes by:
- engaging public sector officials in the Advisory Board of the Centre,
- providing policy briefings summarising research results in an accessible way;
- offering dedicated presentations to brief senior staff in relevant Departments;
- providing expert advice to Parliamentary committees, responding to public consultations, etc.

The Centre will make an impact on the general public by:
- communicating research results in an accessible way through the Centre's blog, website, Facebook, and Twitter;
- organising events open to members of the general public; and
- working with the press in order to disseminate findings to the broader public (via radio, TV, and national newspapers).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3539214</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tidal lagoon energy in Wales - a blog by Jack Miller for In Brief</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAA03CCB-6D0B-41D0-ADA1-DA1A7E2AD23D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Jack Miller, who is currently doing a Fellowship at the National Assembly for Wales Research Service, wrote a blog about the report of an independent review of UK tidal lagoon energy that came out in January 2017.

The workshop led to several requests for further engagement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.sussex.ac.uk/sussexenergygroup/2017/02/14/transforming-the-low-energy-housing-sector/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lucy Baker presented at the IEA workshop on 'The Role of State-owned Enterprises in the Low-Carbon Energy Transition' (26 September 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B583652-7EC0-46C2-883E-0E24A9A579FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lucy Baker gave a talk on 'Governing electricity: from monopoly to market?

The National Audit Office audits and scrutinises central government spending on behalf of Parliament. In this study, they are seeking to explore the issues arising for government from ECO and the Green Deal, and identify lessons for the implementation of future energy efficiency policy. The NAO were aware of Jan's published work on these schemes and on energy efficiency policy more generally and wanted to interview him to obtain an expert perspective on the policies. In particular, we would be interested in discussing.
Jan spoke with 4 people over a two hour period, including the Chief Economist. He focused on 1)the context of the schemes in terms of wider government energy policy, international comparisons, etc.
2) the government's objectives for the schemes, alternative options, the costs of implementing them, and their achievements so far
3) the government's process of evidence-gathering, designing the schemes and consulting on them, and making changes to them over time
4) views on what future policies ought to look like and how they might be informed by lessons learned from Green Deal and ECO.
Following the interview Jan was invited to be on the NAO expert panel to review the evaluation of government household energy efficiency programmes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tim Schwanen and Debbie Hopkins participated in the Test Drive the Future event, organised by Oxford City Council</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F583E76-DB24-408C-B493-5575C82BEC8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Tim Schwanen, Dr Debbie Hopkins and other staff from the Transport Studies Unit at the University of Oxford participated in the Test Drive the Future event, organised by Oxford City Council to promote awareness and knowledge of electric vehicles among the city's inhabitants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Key Speaker at fuel poverty event in Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92F9B46B-BF7C-4456-A688-D408603A86D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Mari Martiskainen was one of the key speakers at 'Warmer, Healthier and Fairer: Tackling Fuel Poverty' event organised by Public Policy Exchange.

The organisation is a member of the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand's Advisory Group playing a very valuable role advising on the policy relevance of the Centre's research. Florian gave a seminar on 'Policy mixes and the transition towards a low carbon economy' where he outlined some of the conceptual thinking around sustainability transitions and policy mixes, often including various policy goals, instruments and strategies. It has long been acknowledged within 'innovation studies' that the stimulation of innovation involves different types of policy instruments, but how such instruments interact and form policy mixes has only recently become of interest. He argued that transitions imply not only the development of disruptive innovations but also of policies aiming for systemic change. Ideally policy mixes for transitions might include elements of 'creative destruction', aiding low energy innovations to gain ground while destabilising existing, unsustainable, socio-technical energy systems. He then went on to apply this thinking to current UK policies to stimulate energy efficiency in buildings. This was followed by a very interesting discussion with the Green Alliance team about the applicability of this research to current energy policymaking , making some interesting observations on the research project which will help in later stages of the work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mari Martiskainen gave a presentation at 'Community Solutions to Fuel Poverty' workshop organised by Energise Sussex Coast</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5FFBCDC9-D8E5-4BCD-A87D-09002AA0855F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mari Martiskainen presented her research on fuel poverty at a workshop organised by Energise Sussex Coast on 13 May 2016.

With a first round of research projects already underway CIED is starting to develop ideas for a second round of projects. The aim of this workshop was to discuss opportunities to match projects where possible to city priorities where there could be a mutual benefit and knowledge sharing potential. Opportunities explored were possible placement of researchers within the council for short secondments to facilitate knowledge exchange and sharing of research findings to support council policy development.

In attendance from Brighton and Hove City Council were a number of people working across all areas of sustainability including transport planning, City planning, housing and energy management.

Following a presentation given by Centre Director Steve Sorrell on the research focus and themes of CIED, Tim Schwanen, Co-Director presented an outline of the project Innovations in urban transport 'and shared some initial findings. A subsequent round table discussion on the project identified several opportunities for future collaboration on transport related issues as did a conversation on the project The diffusion of energy service contracting where there may be a possibility for a CIED researcher to undertake a short placement to further the research in this area.


The workshop concluded with several follow up opportunities identified and a commitment by CIED to organise more such workshops through the 'engagement hub' that bring local organisations interested in energy demand together.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paula Kivimaa co-wrote a blog on 'Beyond experiments: Understanding how climate governance innovations become embedded' for INOGOV</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>59FCBFA4-D091-474C-A49D-42302DAC73FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paula Kivimaa wrote a blog for INOGOV together with Bruno Turnheim and Frans Berkhout on 'Beyond experiments: Understanding how climate governance innovations become embedded'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.inogov.eu/blog-beyond-experiments-understanding-how-climate-governance-innovations-become-embedded/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Karoline Rogge Invited to give talk at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) internal seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07C31A1E-FA22-42F1-A0ED-767CC8CCAF32</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Karoline Rogge gave invited seminar talk at BEIS on January 31, 2017 entitled &amp;quot;German energy policy &amp;amp; the Energiewende&amp;quot;.

This group put forward a joint bid for three Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) programmes.

The Oxford bid to the Go Ultra Low Scheme by the Office of Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) has been partially successful. Oxford was not selected as one of the five winning cities but was one of the 'runner-up' cities. This means that OLEV will fund a large pilot with on-street charging technologies that will run in 2016-18. For more information on the results see: https://www.goultralow.com/go-ultra-low-cities-an-extra-5m-boost-to-electric-cars/. 
Oxford City Council &amp;amp; Oxfordshire County Council have been awarded &amp;pound;816,000 to run this project. Unfortunately, only 2% - approx. &amp;pound;16,000 - is available for revenue funding, which leaves no funding for the monitoring and evaluation that was going to be carried out by CIED and TSU. An additional bid to fund these activities has therefore been made the Oxfordshire Local Economic Partnership. &amp;pound;77,500 has been requested in a first round proposal, the result of which can be expected later in March. Other ways to fund the monitoring and evaluation components are also currently explored by the City &amp;amp; County Councils in conjunction with Tim Schwanen. 
CIED and TSU were partners in the original consortium, which also featured BMW, the Energy Savings Trust, Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council. Of these partners at least CIED/TSU, the councils and BMW will be involved in the demonstration project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researcher secondment to Department of Energy and Climate Change</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B03C9CD2-4767-4029-B3F0-D18C96EC4CAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIED is funding the short-term placement of researchers in stakeholder organizations to facilitate knowledge exchange.
