for Autistic Spectrum Conditions</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I004394/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Imagining Autism is a collaboration between the disciplines of drama and psychology, promoting cross disciplinary research both within and beyond the arts and humanities. Our main aim is to test the hypothesis that many aspects of autism can be ameliorated through participation in drama based activities, specifically live, interactive performance. Our contention is that the embodied qualities of participatory, immersive performance create an opening into the autistic child's world. If successful, the project will provide the basis for a large-scale efficacy trial, and more generally, will raise the possibility that other forms of developmental disorder might also benefit from drama-based interventions. As a consequence, we will disseminate our findings across a wide audience that reaches beyond academia to Health, Education and Social Services. \n\nAutism affects as many as 1 in 100 people in the UK and is characterised by a pervasive spectrum of impairments in social interaction, social communication and imagination. There is no cure for autism and there is no single effective intervention. The search continues for an intervention approach which produces demonstrable and generalisable gains for at least the majority of children with autism. There is a lack of research into many interventions that claim to be effective, including drama. Simon Baron-Cohen whose research has transformed our understanding of autism states that ' for severe autism, it may be that no one single method is effective for all children. But researching such methods may enable us to develop a range of methods that teachers, therapists and parents can turn to, to help children connect with the social world.' (Baron Cohen, 2007). This project aims to develop these methods. \n \nOur hypothesis is predicated on a close relationship between the triad of impairments which are the diagnostic criteria for autism and the constituent elements of drama:\nImagination through the construction of a fictional or alternative reality\nInteraction in the physical engagement between performer(s) and audience\nCommunication through the dialogue between performer(s) and audience \n\nGiven this relation, the project uses drama techniques as an intervention for autism to facilitate language and communication, sociability and empathy and imagination and creativity. The proposed intervention is designed to help autistic children to compensate for their difficulties through participation in fictional structures in visual and sensory environments using, for example, puppetry, light, sound and multimedia. These help the participants develop 'felt' understanding through experiential, physical and immersive media. Since the highly visual, kinetic and aural qualities of the autistic imagination are also the qualities of contemporary performance, the project also investigates how drama might help us to understand the imagination in relation to autism.\n\nThe project uses psychological approaches to evaluate the impact of the intervention on three groups of six children, exploring the effect of the intervention on their social interaction, communication and imagination. It will employ a wide range of measures, most of which will be measures which have been used before in studies of intervention in autism. As in other recent intervention evaluations, the main outcome variable will be the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (Lord et al., 2001). In addition to the ADOS, the evaluation will use measures of theory of mind, imitation, emotion recognition as well as observations of spontaneous social activity and play and ratings by parents and staff of attention, social engagement, communication and play based activities.\n \nIn keeping with the aims of the AHRC scheme, the proposed project promises to further understanding of contemporary human culture through drama and performance practices and our encounter with the autistic consciousness.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary\n\nWho will benefit from the research?\n\nThe development of a relatively simple template that can be cheaply and flexibly applied in a range of non academic contexts will be of benefit to a range of potential user groups:\n\nIndividuals with autistic spectrum conditions\n\nParents and carers of these individuals\n\nArts Practitioners in applied and community theatre\n\nEducators (preschool/primary/secondary teachers/teaching assistants/educational psychologists/speech therapists)\n\nLocal Education Authorities \n\nSocial Services \n\nHealth services (paediatricians/clinical psychologists)\n\nHow will they benefit?\nIndividuals with autistic spectrum conditions will benefit from increased opportunities for social interaction, imagination and communication.\n\nParents and careers will benefit from increased opportunities for remediation in the children they care for.\n\nArts practitioners will benefit from a proven technique of intervention which is flexible and can be creatively adapted\n\nEducators will similarly benefit from access to a relatively cheap and flexible intervention \n\nLocal Education Authorities will benefit from effective and cost efficient training packages for inset days and short courses\n\nSocial Services will similarly benefit from effective and cost efficient interventions which can be used in a range of contexts (e.g. respite centres; weekend and holiday play schemes)\n\nHealth Services will benefit from access to similar training packages as above but these techniques may also be adapted and developed to facilitate child friendly methods of diagnostic assessment\n\nWhat will be done to ensure they benefit\nThe project allows for follow up workshops and training materials for use by parents, carers, teachers, social workers, paediatricians, psychologists and other beneficiaries as listed above. As part of the intervention parents and teachers will be given guidance and support to continue the work started by the practitioners in order to maintain any gains and to provide the same intervention to other children in the school. The project will also inform the work of practitioners working in the field of applied theatre . Workshops held at the end of the project will be used both to disseminate the findings to those who were involved in any way in the project and to seek their feedback on the process and the interpretation of the results. \nFinally, local education authorities will benefit in that the project hopes to demonstrate that it is possible to produce demonstrable, positive and maintainable gains for these children with a relatively low intensity, low cost, school-based intervention which can be administered by trained teachers and practitioners working in the school environment. Investment in establishing drama-based interventions programmes in schools will reap benefits in the long run if the children undergoing the programmes are more able to cope and engage better with others around them as adults. It will potentially improve children's ability to cope with the social demands of school and enable them to better reach their academic potential. The project would provide clear evidence of the impact of the intervention and the conditions in which it is most effective, which Local Education authorities could use to justify support for schools implementing the programme.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>344187</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Documentary film based on the project and featuring participants from the final school with contributions from parents and teachers.

From 6 - 16 March 2017 Imagining Autism will be in residence at The Atkinson.
Over 150 children from two local schools, Rowan Park School and Presfield High School &amp;amp; Specialist College, are participating in an Imagining Autism residency at The Atkinson in March 2017. All of the children have varied educational needs and are participating in the three year Start arts programme run by Children &amp;amp; the Arts and delivered by The Atkinson. Start has been using The Atkinson's cultural resources and opportunities to introduce the children - many of whom have never visited an art gallery before - to the pleasure and benefits of engaging with the arts. Through visits, workshops and the opportunity to create their own artwork for display at The Atkinson, the children improve their communication skills, self-confidence, knowledge and practical abilities. To complement the work with Children &amp;amp; the Arts and local SEN schools, The Atkinson has invited Imagining Autism, a special project by The University of Kent's drama department, for a two week residency 'Outer Space' between 6th - 16th March at The Atkinson. 

This project shows the social impact of academic research on the real world and its results will have the potential to influence the practice of museum and galleries as well as the potential for future multi-sensory programming across the arts.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Autistic Society</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Autistic Society</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DA6FE46-E6FB-44A1-81FF-656767C9A5CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training programme of CPD workshops.

Influenced by the Bauhaus, the lecture was about transformation - not just the alluring or intriguing visual transformation that dress, costume and bodily accoutrements can achieve, but a real and lasting transformation in wearer, witness and maker. Dr Melissa Trimingham applied this notion to her work with autistic children in Imagining Autism, and Donatella Barbieri explored synergies with the Bauhaus via narratives, gestures and performed meanings deriving from Lecoq's LEM workshop. The question and answer session was lengthy and almost exclusively directed at the Imagining Autism project. Members of the audience stayed behind afterwards and discussed the project; many asked for the URL to the project.

Imagining Autism workshops for participants aged 6-17 (so covering Key stage 1 and keys stages 3 and 4 in addition to key stage 2). Total participants approx 75. Professional training: 2 sessions for education, health, social care professionals (60 participants for Weds 8 March, approx 25 participants expected for Tues 14 March); Autism cafes for families and carers (15 participants, Mon 13th and approx 25 participants Thurs 16 March).

Further Info: From 6 - 16 March 2017 Imagining Autism was in residence at The Atkinson, an Arts Centre in Southport. Children from two local SEN schools, Rowan Park School and Presfield High School &amp;amp; Specialist College, participated in the programme. All of the children had varied educational needs and are participating in the three year Start arts programme run by Children &amp;amp; the Arts and delivered by The Atkinson. Start has been using The Atkinson's cultural resources and opportunities to introduce the children - many of whom have never visited an art gallery before - to the pleasure and benefits of engaging with the arts. Through visits, workshops and the opportunity to create their own artwork for display at The Atkinson, the children improve their communication skills, self-confidence, knowledge and practical abilities. To complement the work with Children &amp;amp; the Arts and local SEN schools, The Atkinson invited Imagining Autism for a two week residency 'Outer Space' between 6th - 16th March.

For 2 weeks the Imagining Autism pod was built in the Atkinson studio and children from Rowan Park and Presfield High took their very own journey into Outer Space. Each child , working with the IA team, arrived in a rocket exploring the different planets, moon walking, shadow play, meeting the alien and feeding him moon rocks then returned back to earth.
This project showed the social impact of academic research on the real world and the results from the Atkinson have the potential to influence the practice of museum and galleries as well as the potential for future multi-sensory programming across the arts.

In addition, professional training events took place on Wednesday 8 March, 6.30pm-8.30pm at The Atkinson and Tuesday 14 March, 5pm-7pm at Litherland Sports Park. Professor Nicola Shaughnessy and Dr Melissa Trimingham from The University of Kent team presented their work and discussing how their findings can be applied in a variety of contexts. Both events were sold out.
A Family Autism Caf&amp;eacute; was also available on Monday 13 March, 5pm-7pm at The Atkinson and Thursday 16 March, 1.30pm-2.45pm at Rowan High School, Litherland. These FREE and informal events were aimed at parents and carers of children with autism. As parents of autistic children themselves, Professor Nicola Shaughnessy and Dr Melissa Trimingham shared and discussed how their findings can be applied at home as well as inviting families to share and discuss their own experiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Magazine Coverage:  Care Apointments</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>98C5007E-283D-442D-8CE3-1D21CAEAD724</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Media coverage of Imagining Autism for Families in Care Appointments online Magazine on 1st July 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.careappointments.co.uk/education-training/item/39951-kent-academics-to-extend-innovative-autism-project-to-include-entire-family</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Imagining Autism feature in 'Special Children' magazine, April/May 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F5120B6-6F8E-472E-9096-9DA9A7E07F97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Imagining Autism feature in 'Special Children' magazine, April/May 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>2000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

It also identified the measures that seemed to work best for evaluating the impact of the intervention. 

Secondly, this study also provided preliminary evidence that the intervention makes a difference to many of the children who took part. Almost half the children improved significantly on at least one measure of social interaction, six of them on the core measure, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS). Those who increased most in reciprocal social interaction were those who were less severely affected by their autism, in particular in terms of communication. It is likely that these children show more accelerated change whereas those with lower levels of functioning need longer to start to show changes. The 10 weeks of the intervention might not have been enough to see significant changes for this group. 

Thirteen children increased substantially (more than would have been predicted by increase in chronological age) on some aspect of communication as rated by the parents and three improved significantly on the Communication domain of the ADOS. 

In terms of play and imagination, there were few significant changes in these domains. However, 2 children showed noteworthy changes in their imaginative play on the ADOS and four children also showed substantial increases in observed joint functional play with objects during unstructured (play time observations) observations. 

One of the most noteworthy findings was a significant increase across all children in the accuracy with which children in the study recognized facial expressions. This was particular pronounced for the children with lower levels of social and adaptive functioning. 

Finally, teacher ratings of severity of autism declined significantly post intervention across the whole sample. In two schools the reduction in severity of was significant as rated by teachers; eight children showed significant changes individually. Parent ratings of severity of autism also decreased for the whole sample and almost three quarters of the children showed at least some positive change in terms of the severity of autism as rated by their parents. Interviews with parents and teachers highlighted the enjoyment the children had experienced and how easily they had gone to the sessions with the drama practitioners. 19 parents were interviewed following the intervention :
? All reported that they wanted their child to access more sessions. 
? 16 said their child had gained as a result of the intervention in some way. 
? For some the gain was enjoyment and increased confidence, for others the gain was related to communication and language, for others play, imagination and socialisation. 
? A number of families in particular were very clear that the gain was due to the intervention.

As a multi-disciplinary research team, we are now in a better position to apply for funding for a larger, better controlled study that will establish proof of concept for the Imagining Autism intervention.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This study established the feasibility of both conducting the Imagining Autism sessions in schools as well as preliminary evidence that the intervention has a positive effect on a number of different measures for a substantial proportion of the children involved. The next step in terms of research will be to seek funding for a larger, better controlled trial study that will provide proof of concept for the intervention. Exploring the impact in other settings and using different measures is already planned through a collaboration with Stony Brook University, New York. However the project illustrated that the children at the very least enjoyed the intervention and were very keen to take part. Making the intervention available to more children in a wider range of settings will be possible and will be necessary as part of the larger trial study. Discussions on how to develop the capacity of the IA team are already underway. Collaborations with other groups working in related areas are currently being established in order to achieve this greater capacity to deliver Imagining Autism to more children. At this stage, the particular group who will take forward the findings will be the research team and collaborators as well as the practitioners working in the field. Teachers in some of the specialist autism schools have already received some training inspired by the intervention which they can take forward to their day to day practice of working with the children. In the future this area of impact should be increased.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>958EE162-4180-4631-A73C-429FD4730110</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Interdisciplinary PhD on Imagining Autism for diagnostic purposes</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC9AF476-B404-43FB-832B-EF4D0E53279D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Yvonne Parks, Consultant Paediatrician for Kent and Canterbury Hospital, has used the project in training her team and is external advisor for the PhD.
