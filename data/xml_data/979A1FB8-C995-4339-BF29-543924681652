In this project we plan to develop an entirely new platform for community news based on interactive newsprint. This is enabled by developments in printed electronics which now allow various digital devices and interfaces to be built into paper documents, including audio storage, speakers, microphones, buttons, sliders, led displays, colour changing fibres, led text displays and mobile communication. While there are many possible configurations and uses of this technology for supporting new forms of reading and writing, we plan to explore those relating to the communication of local news. Existing forms of local journalism and content will be used to develop a range of interactive paper documents and test them out in both a lab and field setting. This will explore new forms of digital storytelling and more effective ways of connecting communities to local news and information. To do this we aim to harness the potential of the world leading capacity of the UK's Plastic and Printed Electronics industry for the delivery of hyper-local news content in interactive newsprint. The technology currently has three robust properties that we plan to exploit in this context: 1) Printing touch sensitive areas to paper (input control), 2) Printing flexible paper-thin text displays (screens on paper), 3) Printing speakers (sound from paper). This technology is an alternative to a number of other augmented paper technologies comprising printed 2D optical or conductive codes designed to be read in conjunction with a separate screen-based player for associated content (e.g. anoto, QR codes). In interactive printed text, digital content is encoded in the paper itself on embedded chips or in textual form which can literally be displayed through local fibres or played through their vibration. This research buidls on the Digital Economy Programme Project 'Bespoke' (www.bespokeproject.org).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Lancashire Evening Post (LEP) in Preston is the lead site for Johnston Press' (JP) digital development. Snr editorial staff will work with the research team on new platforms for delivery of content exploring new ways of interacting with audiences. They will supply local news content to the project. They want to learn how new platforms might interface with their existing content management system and editorial work flow and to explore the impact of new interactions on story telling. LEP reporters will attend story telling workshops to inform interaction design. In 2006 Johnston Press funded the first Chair in Digital Journalism, Professor Jane Singer, at UCLan. In 2008 the LEP partnered the 'Bespoke' project. Interactive printed text builds on this relationship. It will also create new links between the LEP and Novalia, local commercial radio station Rock FM and links with community organisations. Meetings with senior staff at the LEP established interest in partnering on this call. The PI met with the editorial team whilst preparing this submission agreeing a framework for their involvement. The DE funded 'Bespoke' project engages with local organisations and networks. Contour Housing, Community Gateway, the YMCA, Ablaze, Sahara, the YMCA and Fishwick Rangers all contribute to the Bespoke newsletter and website. This project will consolidate their involvement. Activities to grow community networks include weekly digital story telling workshops. Callon and Fishwick residents will create content to compliment stories produced by the LEP. The technologies themselves will be given to people in twenty homes on the estate who will benefit from increased access to local news. The PI and Co-I's will share responsibility for any academic publication targeting appropriate conferences and journals. The bespoke websites (www.bespokeproject.org http://news.bespokeproject.org/bespoke) will be used as external communication tools. The PI will co-ordinate media relations using existing contacts with current journalists. The PI will manage the research team and co-ordinate activities throughout the project. Weekly Skype calls with the research team will be the first point of contact. The PI will manage relationships with the LEP and Novalia. Bi-monthly meetings will take place between the PI, the LEP's Editor and staff. The Co-I's will join via Skype. Agreed actions circulated and followed up. The relationship between the academic institutions and the LEP is established, Novalia will be subcontracted to deliver their services to the project. A contract between UCLan and Novalia will formalise this relationship. As JP's lead site for digital the LEP reports centrally to Peterborough HQ. Innovations and product development is implemented through Peterborough and the LEP will be responsible for managing this relationship. Peterborough provides a 'route to market' nationally. Indications are that the LEP will push developments at group level once the prototypes have been tested. This is reflected in their supporting statement and will significantly decrease the technology adoption life-cycle. Novalia will be responsible for developing further collaboration agreements with the LEP or Johnston Press. The PI will facilitate. Colleagues from UCLan's Knowledge Transfer services will assist. The UCLan RA will produce content for the publicity website. PI&amp;amp;Co-I's to share responsibility for the research exploitation activities. A dissemination event at the BFI will complete the project. LEP, Novalia and research team collaboration (July/August 2011). Interactive story telling workshops in Preston (October 2011 - July 2012).

Netexplo, a global initiative and network of journalists, scientists and academics, has listed Interactive Newsprint as one of the world's top 100 outstanding innovations. The RCUK Digital Economy also awarded its Telling Tales of Engagement award. 

Prototypes were also exhibited at the prestigious London Design Festival in September 2012. The Design Festival attracted an estimated 350,000 people and received extensive media coverage. In addition to articles in the national press, the Interactive Newsprint project also received a Best of the Festival commendation from the prestigious Blueprint magazine. 

Our work around conductive inks has expanded beyond Interactive Newsprint, and is most recently seen in the EKKO and Interface projects The Media Innovation Studio has worked on a number of projects over the last five years, such as Interactive Newsprint, that have examined how conductive inks, printed electronics and augmented print could impact on journalism and the media sector. EKKO is the most recent example: a collaboration between our research team, creative agency Uniform and the University of Dundee.

The team worked with a range of industry partners which spanned the Liverpool Echo, Stuff Magazine and book publishers. Our prototypes included a magazine that doubles as a paper games controller and a newspaper pullout that, by simply touching the paper, allows readers to listen to audio commentaries of former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard's greatest goals.
 
Although EKKO isn't yet available commercially, papers and posters presenting it in academic contexts won a number of national and international awards during 2015. These include the Interactive Tables and Surfaces conference's best poster presentation and the British HCI best works in progress and poster award. 

Printed batteries, posters capable of detecting touch, WiFi-blocking and noise-absorbing paper, these are just a selection of innovations brought together in September 2015 by the Paper Evolutions: Exploring Digital and Physical Paper Futures exhibition.

Hosted at VTT, the Technical Research Centre of Finland, in Espoo, near Helsinki, a selection of 16 exhibits invited people to consider a range of radical, digital and disruptive paper and print technologies. 

Paper Evolutions was co-curated by VTT, the Media Innovation Studio and Amsterdam-based HVB Communications. It combined prototypes from across the COST Action FP1104 programme, part of a European network to promote transnational cooperation, and Paper Breakthroughs - a travelling exhibition showcasing innovative paper prototypes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0BD284D0-D82F-40DD-8700-98E99478DC31</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ver the last year, our research has sought to explore the intersection between the physical and digital in the context of the increasingly expansive field of the 'Internet of Things' (IoT). Our 'physical' is EKKO, a clip that powers conductive inks creating a capacitive touch matrix on paper. The digital takes the form of 'Interface': an IoT publishing platform capable of transferring media and data to and from the web-connected print &amp;amp; collecting analytics from the interactions, and a companion app that enables the novel user experiences.

EKKO comprises off the shelf technologies; an Electric Imp combined with a capacitance sensor to measure the ink button presses, a small rechargeable Li-Po battery and an LED for user feedback. It is situated at the edge of a piece of print and clip pressure enables a circuit connection. The Electric Imp was adopted due to its ability to easily scale, open community and security. The companion app is a second screen to print, once paired the app delivers rich content seemingly embedded in the print.

'Interface' provides real-time updatable content to internet- connected print and displays analytics associated with the print, its touch-points and user engagement with content, and therefore generates record and visualise 'Paper Data'. Additionally, Interface is being developed to work with other internet-connected objects. It is designed to be only accessible by the publishers of the content and print content and therefore the design choices for how it works are influenced by ease of use for publisher, their workflow and how they would choose to experience the platform.

Following the development of Interface and EKKO, the research team feel there is a broad range of future work to be pursued within the news industry, but also beyond it. This would be designed to explore digital opportunities relating to the ubiquity of paper and its role in our everyday lives, how to meet a range of further research questions - such as interaction approaches, robustness and scalability, and exploring use cases across a range of industries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>we continue to build on the core technology in colaboration with EU partners.
