These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1243334</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Poplar HARCA</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>SeMIoT</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C1AA5A4-FD8E-4352-BC56-9A6A2915C2E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Powbal platform currently under development :http://grove-cloud.groveis.com:8080/powbal/
The final platform will be under the www.powbal.net</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Wi-fi Plug contributes with the delivery of the plugs, the support for their API and the discounts in accessing (polling) the IoT equipment. We have weekly meetings with the entire team (CEO and two senior engineers) and we have constant updates in cases of work that affects our experiments.
Grove IS helps develop the Powbal platform. This allows us to schedule the switch-off events for hundreds of plugs, collect the status of each plug and store the data. The platform also calculates the reward points based on the performance of each individual (if they abide by the smart grid choices or not and the power consumed). The company supports the platform, hosts the server on its cloud infrastructure, stores the data for our work and provides support related to the performance of the platform. We also have a two-year Premium support (worth 9,600 GBP) for a 24/7 phone and email support, In version maintenance, feature enhancement support and version upgrade protection (See contract).
Poplar Harca hosts the testbed for SeMIoT experiments, these are the residences that host the plugs we measure. Poplar provides us with access to their facilities, connection with impact champions (energy sensitive individuals to &amp;quot;spread the word&amp;quot; about our work), background information (addresses, names, etc) for the participants, management of the lists and the changes in their premises, etc. They also have organised bi weekly calls with us to provide updates about the progress of the experiments. 
An individual researcher (Alexandros Kosiaris) has helped us to produce the new version of the Powbal platform and contributed to the previous rounds of these experiments. Without his support on a weekly basis this platform would not have become a reality.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research team creates the algorithms the randomly allocate switch off events to the plugs. The team analyzes the responses from the participants and informs them about their performance. The team distributes rewards and monitors the use of the plugs consequently. The research team manages the distribution of the plugs, the resolution of technical faults and the replacement of equipment. The team also reports the results on the dedicated website : www.powbal.net and the PETRAS hub.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration on Formal Techniques to Arms Verification</gtr:description><gtr:id>94472ABF-62AB-48B5-B50C-E4913388F606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Software at https://bitbucket.org/pjbeaumont/inmm2016/
