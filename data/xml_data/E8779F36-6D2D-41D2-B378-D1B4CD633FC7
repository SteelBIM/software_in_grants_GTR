Although not found anywhere other than Tibet, Bon is nevertheless quite certainly somewhat different from the genuinely indigenous original Tibetan religion, with which it has sometimes been erroneously confused, not least by the Bon themselves. While the original indigenous Tibetan religion was in great part a sacrificial cult focussed on the worship of sacred mountains and spirits within the Tibetan landscape and on the person of the Tibetan emperor, Bon by contrast is in reality a more universalistic faith with significant components imported from abroad, and appears to be substantially modelled on Indian Tantrism and monasticism. Moreover, as far as current evidence shows, Bon first arose in Tibet within approximately the same historical period as Tantric Buddhism, and not, as they claim, a great many centuries earlier.\nIn fact, no-one yet understands how Bon arose, nor what its sources or antecedents are: but if we did understand this, we would not only understand Bon better, but we would also have a very much better understanding indeed of the formative processes of Tibetan religion in general, Buddhism included, which still remains extremely obscure in important respects. To finally understand Bon origins would hugely clarify much else about Tibet.\nThe situation is complicated by polemics: Bon and Buddhism share considerable similarities, but each attribute this to plagiarism by the other. Both traditions claim a much greater antiquity than the other. There are also contrasting historical ideologies: while Buddhism reveres and venerates the powerful Yar-lung Dynasty of Central Tibet, Bon reveres and venerates the old kingdom of Zhang-zhung based in Western Tibet, which was conquered by the Yar-lung Dynasty. \nIn short, the situation remains quite confusing, and no one yet knows how Buddhism, Bon and the original pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet were originally inter-related and shaped one another in the crucial early formative centuries of Tibetan religion. Efforts to unravel this most significant of historical periods by taking broad general overviews, or by using conventional historical sources, have so far been frustrated, not least because of the deep layers of polemics and ideology built up over time. \nSome years ago, we hit on a specific method for unravelling the problem. There is a Tantric ritual cycle called Phur-pa that originated as a distinctly minor tradition in India - yet which was rapidly adopted and expanded by both Bon and Buddhism in Tibet with such enthusiasm that it became (and remains) probably the single most popular cycle for both traditions. This shows that Phur-pa is a key: its enthusiastic initial adoption indicates unique affinities with the original indigenous religion, while its separate but parallel Bon and Buddhist trajectories enable minute comparative studies.\nIn our earlier Research Projects, we focused on the earliest Buddhist Phur-pa traditions, and on Phur-pa's remarkable affinities with the original indigenous religion. We believe we have made tremendous progress in these fields. Now we want to fill in the last parts of the puzzle by making a minute study of the earliest Bon Phur-pa, and seeing how it fits our other data. As well as minutely studying the early Bon texts, we will also map and index the outer contours of this large literature. No one has yet studied early Bon Phur-pa texts, which would remain quite impenetrable without the specialised prior knowledge that we have laboriously accumulated through our last three AHRC projects on earliest Buddhist Phur-pa. We will analyse the relevant texts, ritual performances, myths, indigenous histories, and doctrines alike, and publishing findings in books, articles and websites.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>220204</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ruhr University Bochum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>K?te Hamburger Kolleg</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaborations with Ruhr-University Bochum and others</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BBDEF09-371E-439D-AA0C-20168665DE81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Separate publications, listed separately.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Program run jointly by the Consortium for &amp;quot;Dynamics in the History of Religions Between Asia and Europe&amp;quot; at the Ruhr-University Bochum (Prof Volkhard Krech), and the Department of Religious Studies and Classics at the University of Texas at Austin (Prof Karl Galinsky).

Prof Canzio visited us to discuss the project, and we have exchanged materials on Bon po ritual performances, and will continue to do so.

Dr Jean-Luc Achard of the CNRS, Paris, acted as consultant to the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>In October 2011 Dr Mayer was invited to the K&amp;auml;te Hamburger Kolleg, Ruhr-University Bochum, to deliver a lecture on some of this project's findings. We found we had a lot of common interests with its director Prof. Volkhard Krech (whom we had never encountered before), and as a consequence, an agreement was made for future academic cooperation in the field of religious contact and transfer. The first active part of this collaboration was Dr Mayer's participation at two conferences, one in Austin, Texas, late September 2012, and one in Bochum, Germany, Spring 2013. These were the opening activities of a program run jointly by the Consortium for &amp;quot;Dynamics in the History of Religions Between Asia and Europe&amp;quot; at the Ruhr-University Bochum (Prof Volkhard Krech), and the Department of Religious Studies and Classics at the University of Texas at Austin (Prof Karl Galinsky), of which we were members from the outset.

We were also invited to a further collaboration with Dr Carmen Meinert, also of Bochum, in the field of Inner Asian religion. 

A further new collaboration is with Prof Riccardo Canzio, emeritus Professor of Musicology, National Taiwan University. 

Research on this project brought us into a close working relationship with Ven Tenpa Yungdrung &amp;amp; HH Tenzin Namdak, two of the leading contemporary Bon lamas. Our relationship has been exceptionally cordial and warm, and we aspire and expect and to work together again in the future.

The project was undertaken from the outset in collaboration with Dr Jean-Luc Achard of the CNRS, Paris, who acted as consultant. The collaboration worked very well: Dr Achard was exemplary in his diligence, promptness and general helpfulness. We very much hope to work with Dr Achard again in the future.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Kilikilaya blog, The great Khu tsha zla 'od</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>184B8977-8D22-4665-B34D-8AB49C8081A3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The entry generated some interest in the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.orient.ox.ac.uk/kila/2012/04/27/the-great-khu-tsha-zla-od/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blogging</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8774EFC2-8035-409D-8D3E-6AC8011BB602</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blogs sparked lively discussions.

It is hard to quantify impact of this type. We have shown pretty conclusively that the canon of the Tibetan Bon religion involved not merely a copying of Buddhism as many previous scholars have argued, nor even a rewriting of Buddhism, as Snellgrove argued. Rather, it involved a reconstruction and re-presentation of numerous genuinely indigenous religious and ritual categories, but now reframed within a Buddhist-style textual architecture. We show how this was a natural, even inevitable, outcome of the 10th century transformation of the Tibetan ritual economy from one centred on burial tumuli, to one centred on lamas and gompas (dgon pa), which was in turn a direct consequence of the collapse of the empire, and the wider regional ecological and economic catastrophe of the mid ninth century.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0264476D-0B89-4D21-88CE-4DFF0AC3E917</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We produced a complete and annotated translation of an important scripture of the indigenous non-Buddhist Tibetan Bon religion. No Bon scripture of comparable length, influence, or antiquity has previously been translated. We also constructed a text-edition based on available versions of the Tibetan text. Our annotations referred to early commentarial texts, and benefitted from prolonged oral consultation with leading contemporary Bon lamas. Together, they comprise over three hundred pages, a significant proportion of Cantwell and Mayer's forthcoming book with Brill.
Inspired by analytic techniques developed by the Hebraist Peter Sch&amp;auml;ffer, we exposed an ingenious literary strategy employed by the Black Pillar's author, Khu-tsha-zla-'od, to situate his Bon Phur-pa tradition vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the Buddhist prototypes on which it was modelled. We show how Khu-tsha-zla-'od consistently asserted differences to Buddhism at the level of individual 'lemmata' (the elemental building blocks of ritual categories), while simultaneously asserting similarities at the composite levels of 'microforms' and 'macroforms' (complex structures of connected lemmata). This created distinctive independent Bon Phur-pa rituals, competent to compete with the Buddhist ones, yet forestalling grounds for Buddhist persecution. Such strategies have not been exposed before. They cut through previous simplistic explanations of Bon merely copying Buddhism, or ex-nihilo textual invention. This represents a significant breakthrough in understanding how Bon scriptures were constructed, and suggests a clear continuity in Bon ritual and social identity from before Buddhism until after. Further analysing our literary findings within social and economic history, we believe we have successfully answered fundamental outstanding questions about Bon origins.
We also made a key discovery regarding the Black Pillar's treatment of indigenous Tibetan deities that indicates how it balanced an underlying Buddhist sa?sara-nirva?a metaphysics with indigenous rituals. The Black Pillar lists numerous pre-Buddhist deities, yet insists they all partake of the nirva?ic nature of its central Buddhist-style deity. This contrasts to Buddhism, which treats such indigenous deities as dubious worldly spirits that must be tamed by the Buddhas and restricted to the margins of their sacred space (ma??ala). This sheds light on the ideological concerns and social location of Khu-tsha-zla-'od: on the one hand a privileged intellectual, almost as steeped in Buddhist philosophy as in Bon learning, on the other hand resolutely upholding indigenous rites and beliefs, refusing to relegate them to folkloric marginality.
We confirmed Khu-tsha-zla-'od must have had an exceptional insider knowledge of Buddhist Phur-pa, supporting traditional accounts that Khu-tsha-zla-'od was simultaneously Buddhist and Bon-po, something sometimes doubted by modern scholars. Comparing our findings with Gyatso's work on Khu-tsha-zla-'od's compatriot, the 13th century Buddhist master Chos-dbang, likewise portrayed as both Buddhist and Bon, we can now confirm her conclusions, and moreover posit a local cluster in Lhobdrag where leading intellectuals were simultaneously (but separately) active under both Buddhist and Bon rubrics.
We found a valuable edition of Khu-tsha-zla-'od's Phur-pa texts in a Kathmandu library, where they had been obscured by faulty cataloguing.
We generated a substantial set of professional quality videos and photos of contemporary Bon Phur-pa ritual, which is still based on Khu-tsha-zla-'od's Black Pillar.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic: Our analysis, the first of a Bon tantric scripture of such magnitude and antiquity, shows that contrary to received academic opinion, considerable clearly identifiable ritual continuities do indeed exist between pre-Buddhist Tibetan religion, and post-Buddhist Bon. Moreover, such continuities persist visibly within the elite literary tradition represented by this text, where they were not expected at all, not merely in the village or folk tradition, where they were more expected. Thus our findings call into question the very idea of discriminating between an elite Bon textual tradition based on Buddhism and a popular Bon village tradition based on pre-Buddhist belief, since the same elements can appear in both. The way is now open for scholars to rethink Bon religious identity, as having genuine continuities with pre-Buddhist religion, rather than as never having existed at all before Buddhism. Similar Bon scriptures should also be examined, for evidence of pre-Buddhist ritual continuities. 
Non-academic: Our forthcoming complete densely annotated illustrated translation of the Black Pillar, with introductory materials, in well over 300 pages, will allow a greater level of understanding within the Bon faith community, far more of whom can read English than can read twelfth century Tibetan.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B031D32B-9A8E-45F7-B72B-C78F4ABE1ECE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and
