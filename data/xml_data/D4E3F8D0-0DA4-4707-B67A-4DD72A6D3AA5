Design Highlight: Empowering Design Practices: historic places of worship as catalysts for connecting communities</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M001709/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposal considers the contribution community-led design can make to unlock the potential of historic places of worship to be a highly valuable community resource as well as a fundamental part of UK's national collective culture. The aim is to examine how community-led design practices can help empower those that look after historic places of worship to engage effectively with their communities and develop their creative capacity, to think 'designerly' and to realise inclusive and sustainable places. This is what we refer to as 'empowering design practices'. 

The project focuses specifically on the potential of places of worship to be sensitively adapted for wider community services through community-led design practices and on the impact of these practices on people, communities and place. 
 
Our core partners include advisory bodies such as English Heritage (EH) and the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance (HRBA), funders such as Heritage Lottery Fund, design professionals, such as Wright and Wright architects, research-based consultancy bodies such as the Bureau of Design Research (BDR), and design support and infrastructure organisations such as The Glass-House Community Led Design. The academic team will bring in a range of different disciplines and perspectives, from architecture, design research, arts and media to architectural history, heritage studies and cultural studies.
 
The project starts with the observation that advisory bodies and funders for the protection of heritage - such as the Heritage Lottery Fund - are moving away from a model focused exclusively on repairs and restoration of the physical structure of buildings to a model that places a new emphasis on the long term use of these places, the engagement of the larger community in the design process and the co-production of new uses and solutions that will make the places relevant to people and society. However, despite these changes there is a concern that professional design practices are still disconnected from the needs and practices of communities; the processes that support and empower communities to develop and take ownership of their space are not well established; and there is very little understanding of the value of these processes in creating inclusive and sustainable places. 
 
The project will use design-based and other creative-based methods of enquiry (design studio, prototyping, visual and emotional mapping, asset mapping, digital storytelling) and will involve a diverse program of engagement with a wide network of communities delivered in collaboration with our partners: from one-to-one support and design workshops with communities, to peer learning events, study tours and networking activities. The project will also include a program that aims to build capacity for research by design in the context of community led design practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research:
The research activities and outputs of the project are expected to benefit individuals and organisations representing multiple sectors and a wide range of roles. Apart from academics working in the areas of design research, community-led design, architecture, and heritage and cultural studies, the project will benefit a number of different stakeholders nationally:
- individuals and communities involved in CLD in their local area and particularly communities looking after historic places of worship 
- professionals working in regeneration and CLD (facilitation experts, artists, architects, urban planners), particularly those working in conservation of historic places of worship (ecclesiastical/conservation architects and surveyors)
- third sector organisations mediating, supporting and advocating CLD
- organizations providing support and funding to sustain historic places of worship 
- independent organisations dedicated to promoting design, and organisations interested in embedding innovation in heritage 
- local authority representatives and policy-makers (involved in planning, regeneration, service provision and heritage management)

These stakeholders will benefit from a better understanding of the current landscape surrounding community-led design in the context of historic places of worship, including barriers, opportunities and best practice examples; from gaining access to evidence of impact of those practices; and from practical guidelines and methods for design research and community engagement. 

How will they benefit from the research:
The project is focused on empowering design practices and supporting those involved in CLD and the adaptation of historic places of worship more specifically, to use design thinking in order to lead their projects and effectively engage with their wider communities. The project has built in a wide range of support mechanisms to directly benefit over 30 different projects within 5 years. Other projects/communities will benefit indirectly through gaining access to produced resources providing advice and practical help. The project also includes activities (workshop and events) that bring together communities around places of worship helping them to share experiences and knowledge and potentially create a peer-to-peer support network. The timescale of this impact is likely to spread at least over 10 years.
By developing and evaluating CLD practice and providing evidence of its impact the project is expected to enhance policy making, and the effectiveness of support provided by heritage organizations (funding and advisory bodies). The project also emphasizes capacity building and the development of participatory design research skills for design and community development professionals and students, both through its co-design and co-delivery activities and through its design research training program. Overall, the knowledge derived from the project activities has the potential to enhance the quality and the effectiveness of both the 'process' of empowering and bringing people together to develop and manage a project, and the 'product' in terms of achieving people's expectations and visions taking into consideration design, heritage, cultural and faith values. Achieving inclusivity in the design process is expected to lead to places that attain economic, social and environmental sustainability. 

The outputs of the project (reports, papers, guidance documents and media) will be directly available from the project website and will be disseminated through the academic and community partners networks and through the final conference. The project has intentionally planned different types of outputs for different types of audiences: academic papers, plain language reports, videos, blogs and visual materials. The project will also help stimulate new connections between research and practice communities and create ideas for future collaborations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1208430</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation/Workshop at National Churches Trust Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C90BBA49-81D5-4123-910A-2CE43F93958F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited presentation/workshop at the National Churches Trust's annual conference.

The first live project programme with Sheffield University architecture students took place in September 2016 and the work was focussed on three places (ISRAAC in Sheffield and two churches in Chester and Congleton). The students helped the groups develop a vision for their building and developed potential short, medium and long term solutions. They also helped engage with the wider public into these plans. The participating groups reported a raised awareness about their potential of their building and the road ahead and the work helped spark new ideas. Both students and the participating groups reported that the projects challenged their assumptions. The projects helped students develop new practical skills (in communication, collaboration, project management etc). The second live project is currently being delivered in collaboration with postgraduate students at the Bartlett School of Planning, who work with Bow Church in London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Focus group with professionals on community-led adaptations of historic places of worship</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6FC4D3D8-53BE-43EA-B2BA-E1AF4DC7DB3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In November 2015 the project held a focus group with people who provide professional advice and support for community-led adaptions of historic places of worship, particularly officers working for Historic England and project architects. 

The purpose of the focus group was: 
1) to identify and learn from each other about the core challenges but also assets that help people to carry out adaptions of historic places of worship 
2) to identify and share with each other resources that are required in order to address the above challenges and improve the design process

The activity included mapping exercises of assets and resources on community-led adaptions of historic places of worship and the creation of profiles (for architects and support officers) that specify gaps in their knowledge, skills and resources. 

The core outcomes of the workshop were the following: 
1) Professionals developed their awareness on issues and resources that are available to support their practices 
2) The workshop identified knowledge, skills and resources that are currently used for the development of a national educational program on community led design</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://empoweringdesignpractices.weebly.com/blog/report-from-focus-group-with-architects-and-support-officers</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Targeted/Themed (one-off) workshops for supporting communities to re-imagine their historic places of worship</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B19EA93-C6C9-483F-82AF-5626F4D0946C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Targeted and Themed workshops are one-off workshops/events that aim to unleash or build the capacity of a community to engage in core design tasks such as: sense making of current situation, envisaging potential futures, creation of possible ways to realize the envisaged futures.

The event brought together 8 communities from England that run historic places of worship and who expressed the aspiration to better connect with their wider locality in order to adapt and share their building. 

The purpose of the event was:

1) To connect challenges and assets of different places in order to identify common themes or opportunities for future support activities and resources.
2) To provide professional input and inspiration for participants through small surgeries or workshop activities on topics of community engagement, asset mapping, development of a vision, negotiating conflict and fundraising.

Workshop activities were delivered by members of the Empowering Design Practices team, from the Open University, as well as nonacademic partners from Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic England, Historic Religious Buildings Alliance and The GlassHouse Community Led Design. 

The core outcomes of the event were the following:
1) Communities gained some professional input and inspiration about their project
2) New collaborations emerged that advanced opportunities identified in the event: at the moment 3 places of worship are involved in further collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://empoweringdesignpractices.weebly.com/new-projects.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at HRBA Big Update</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5B91C02-4939-4EAB-818B-A3189038BCA7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation of the project at the Historic Religious Building Alliance's Big Update.

The project delivered a number of activities with communities that run historic places of worship in England as well as professionals, advisors, funders and policy makers. The key findings/outputs can be summarised as follows: 

1. The project identified a spectrum of tensions (and identities) that arise in projects that seek to adapt/develop historic places of worship. These tensions and identities are shaped by the way communities tend to balance the value of heritage, theology of place, community purpose and design/architecture. 

2. The project identified a set of capacities that need to be supported/developed in order to empower local communities to engage in design practices and lead design projects:

? Sense making and envisaging futures (visioning): communities often struggle to move from thinking about their current situation (e.g. needs, issues or threats to the sustainability of a place) into a vision about the identity and future of their place. They often lack the mechanisms to help connect people and inspire them to think about their assets and imagine potential futures to respond to their needs and aspirations. 
? Creating: communities struggle to develop and turn abstract ideas about the future into concrete creations (e.g. spaces, uses or services). This challenge often arises as a difficulty to understand the design process, communicate with domain experts (e.g. architects or heritage experts) but also negotiate conflicts that arise. 
? Engaging: communities often have a wide range of connections with people, professionals, businesses and organisations in their locality and beyond. However, one common challenge is the difficulty to exploit their social capital, explore new connections and turn these connections into collaborations that can inform or support the process of visioning and creation. 
? Planning and Leading: although research suggests that communities often have people with some sort of project management skills they also require an understanding of the peculiarities of design projects. This includes an overview of the steps and tools that are needed in order to vision, create and engage.

3. The project developed a set of approaches for building or unlocking the identified capacities. These approaches range from general strategies, to material resources and tools as well as infrastructuring processes (which include an online educational program) to support people to vision, create, engage and plan their projects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project aims to build capacity in community-led design practice, by connecting people (including community groups with different experts), building transferrable skills and delivering accessible resources. These are intended for volunteers and communities leading projects, but also postgraduate students and professionals (heritage and development support officers, architects etc). 

A lot of the project approaches are taken forward directly by community partners of the project (The Glass-House Community Led Design, Historic England, Heritage Lottery Fund and Historic Religious Buildings Alliance) but also by other communities, professionals or support organisations that find out about these approaches through focus groups, events or presentations. The project is actively seeking to engage and to work with other organisations both to support their practice, and to create pathways for dissemination. For example so far we have engaged with the Churches Conservation Trust, the National Churches Trust, the Prince's Regeneration Trust and the Baroness Warsi Foundation.
 
Moreover the project developed learning opportunities for postgraduate students (e.g. via participation in live projects); a two-day training event for professionals; an online MOOC; and standalone resources and toolkits which may be shared online on the project website and in print at appropriate venues.

Other routes for dissemination of project findings and approaches to empowerment include participation in public events, like for example the Utopia Fair in London in 2016.

Academic avenues of dissemination include presentations in conferences focussed on heritage and design, and a planned end of project conference and engagement event.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9EBEC832-D63A-4C1E-B68F-6C24B703D406</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://empoweringdesign.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Providing evidence and insights about the required strategies for engaging communities in design at the Heritage Lottery Fund's 'Places of Worship Practice Group'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF5B2244-8D57-488D-B358-696D493BE8E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Empowering Design project provided insights about the strategies that are required for supporting local communities to lead transformations in their historic places.
