integrating large scale heterogeneous data</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/F00964X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The list of organisms with completed genome sequence is continuously growing and this has led to the identification of thousands of genes whose function is still unknown. These genes could potentially be involved in important biological cell functions and could represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. A major undertaking for biology is therefore that of identifying the function of these uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. The challenge for bioinformatics is then to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated by wet-lab assays. Luckily, new experimental techniques have become available, producing data which offer clues about protein function and can therefore be employed for function prediction, e.g. protein interaction data, gene expression data. Some experimental and computational data have a natural representation as networks (e.g. protein interaction data), others are inherently 'one-dimensional' (e.g. sequence patterns). Three facts have recently become clear: while each data type contains important information that can help in determining the function of a protein, no single data type by itself suffices; large-scale functional inference greatly improves by integrating evidence from different sources; for those data types which can be represented as networks, the best results are obtained by algorithms that take advantage of the networks' topologies. So far, methods that make functional inferences on networks are very limited in the type of data they can integrate, while methods that can integrate a greater variety of data do not take advantage of the networks' topologies. I intend to investigate a general method that can integrate essentially any data type currently available taking into account its intrinsic structure: it takes advantage of the graph topology for network data, and it can integrate this evidence together with one-dimensional information. I shall develop graph-theoretical methods that use the diffusion of information over graphs to generate functional evidence from network data. This evidence is then combined with other one-dimensional information using machine learning techniques. The strength of the methodology lies in its ability to use diverse sets of noisy data, and to combine them to obtain sound statistical inferences; the weak signals contained in each dataset is enhanced by integrating the data. The methodology will be first developed on Yeast, and I shall then transfer this approach to higher organisms such as C. elegans, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens. For all these organisms the performance of the algorithms will then be evaluated 'in silico' by means of test sets; that is I shall verify the accuracy of the methods at predicting the function for genes whose annotation is known. The approach will then be tested 'in vivo' on a sub-network of genes that form signalling pathways (MAPK signalling) and function to transmit information from receptors to gene expression. MAPK pathway components are highly diversified in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, with 123 components. For many of these we do not know how they connect up and what their biological functions are. These will be predicted by the algorithms and then functionally tested by silencing their expression using RNA interference and in mutant lines. I shall also design and implement stand-alone and web-based software tools incorporating the algorithms developed. The applications will enable the biologist to easily apply the algorithms through a user-friendly interface; to visualize the relevant biological networks thus making the inference process transparent and providing an explanation for the functional annotation predicted by the system. A web tool will also be created. All these tools will be made freely available to the scientific community.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Statistically sound large-scale protein function prediction can be obtained only by integrating evidence from different sources. Functional inference methods that exploit biological networks topologies offer good performance. But so far such methods are limited in the type of data they can integrate, while methods that can integrate a greater variety of data do not take advantage of the networks' topologies. I propose a general method that can integrate essentially any data type available taking into account the intrinsic structure of each data type: it uses graph-theoretic methods to produce functional evidence from network data, and it integrates it with evidence from one-dimensional information using machine learning techniques. Defining function in terms of the Gene Ontology, I shall collect datasets for S. cerevisiae, C. elegans, D. melanogaster, A. thaliana, H. sapiens. Algorithm development and testing will be done on S. cerevisiae. I shall then verify how these methods transfer to the other organisms. Performance on these organisms will be evaluated 'in silico', by means of test sets. The approach will also be tested 'in vivo' by predicting the Biological Process for a group of MAP kinases that belong to the signalling pathways of A. thaliana. These predictions will be tested through functional assays: 1. an RNAi screen and quantitative measurements of MAPK signalling outputs, MAPK activities and promoter activations in cultured Arabidopsis cells 2. quantitative phenotypic tests for selected phenotypes in cell differentiation (e.g. stomata development) and stress responses. I shall design and implement stand-alone and web-based software tools incorporating the algorithms developed. These will enable the biologist to easily apply the algorithms through a user-friendly interface; visualization tools will make the functional inference process transparent to the user. All these tools will be made freely available to the scientific community.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>419814</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Drawing of plants with increased understanding how development shapes growth</gtr:description><gtr:id>2AA8DC33-2F65-42C4-BF65-6ABE7634DFC7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stimulating discussions with students.

We applied some of these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes.

In particular, for this project we deployed: ClusterONE, our algorithm for detecting overlapping protein complexes from PPI networks; GOSSTO, our method for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology; an information diffusion method we developed for denoising protein interaction data.

1) Pablo Sotelo, from the Universidad Nacional de Asuncion (Paraguay) is working with the fungus Macrophomina phaseolina, a plant pathogen affecting more than 500 plant species (many crops among them, including soya). S2F has been used to produce a functional annotation for the proteome of this fungus, which is the first step for its characterization. This work is aimed at finding better and more targeted mechanisms for pest-control. Paraguay is one of the largest producers of soya in the world, and this work has important economic implications for the country.

2) Matteo Pellegrini (University of California, Los Angeles) leads a lab with a high interest in algal genomics. The lab is currently sequencing the genome of the unicellular alga Cyclotella cryptica, a model organism for lipid accumulation. This work has application in the biofuel production industry. The Pellegrini lab has been using the functional predictions provided by S2F to annotate this algal genome.

Importantly, the algorithms we developed for specific biological networks can be applied to other types of networks. Therefore, some of our algorithms have impact not only on those problems for which we originally developed them, but also on different problems in Systems Biology as well as in other disciplines such as Pharmacology, Medicine or even Social Networks.

For example, we originally developed ClusterONE for detecting protein complexes from protein interaction networks. However, ClusterONE is a general algorithm for overlapping clustering on weighted large scale networks. Therefore other research groups have successfully applied ClusterONE and proved its usefulness in several different domains. Some examples include: 

1. Medicine: Clustering a genome-scale network obtained by integrating SNP array, gene expression microarray, array-CGH, CGH, GWAS and gene mutation data. This study was aimed at identifying key functional modules in lung adenocarcinoma.

2. Pharmacology: Associating drugs with protein domains in the context of myocardial infarction.

3. Pharmacology: Studying the mechanisms of adverse side effects of Torcetrapib, a drug being developed to treat hypercholesterolemia (elevated cholesterol levels) and prevent cardiovascular disease (its development was halted in 2006).

4. Social Networks: Detecting communities in Social Networks.


Our research on diffusion methods for protein function prediction led to the development of methods for inference and structure discovery in biological networks. We applied some of these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes. 
In particular, for this project we deployed: ClusterONE, our algorithm for detecting overlapping protein complexes from PPI networks; GOSSTO, our method for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology; an information diffusion method we developed for denoising protein interaction data. 
The protein interaction networks identified experimentally in Emili's lab were enriched with networks generated using comparative genomics approaches in Marcotte's lab. Then, in our lab, we integrated this network with a semantic similarity graph (obtained using GOSSTO), applied our denoising procedure, and finally clustered the resulting graph using ClusterONE.
We thus obtained the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture.
The human protein complexes repository contains all the data generated in this study in an easily navigable format. These include all the pairwise protein interactions obtained through integration of the experimental data with public genomic evidence and the subunit composition of the 622 putative protein complexes obtained by clustering using ClusterONE.

In our group, we have used S2F to participate in the second CAFA challenge, a competition of protein function prediction. Although this activity is within the academic domain, we think it has been important for acquiring visibility and engaging further collaborations.

Finally, GFam was successfully used on Arabidopsis and the family groupings it provided were included in the TAIR10 genome release.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>63DE3ADB-251F-4FD8-8D8C-117958D21C4C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The list of organisms with completed genome sequence is continuously growing and this has led to the identification of thousands of genes whose function is still unknown. These genes could potentially be involved in important biological cell functions and could represent important targets for diagnostic and pharmacogenomics studies and be of industrial and agronomical importance. A major undertaking for biology is therefore that of identifying the function of these uncharacterized genes on a genomic scale. The challenge for bioinformatics is then to devise algorithmic methods that, given a gene, can predict a hypothesis for its function that can then be validated by wet-lab assays.

In this grant we focused our attention to the problem of protein function for organisms for which little or no experimental data is available and the only available information is the set of protein sequences. This is a relevant problem with important implications for both industry and human health - it is the case, for example, of newly sequenced bacterial genomes. We successfully developed a new method for solving this problem based on a recent development in computer science: the diffusion of information over graphs. These methods emulate the way in which heat diffuses on a metal bar.

We also developed two further methods that predict protein function by grouping proteins into families. The first method, called GFam (Gene Family Annotation and Maintenance) groups proteins in a way that proteins in the same group share common domain architecture, and hence function. SCPS (Spectral Clustering of Protein Sequences) groups proteins according to their sequence similarity - similar proteins are likely to have evolved from a common ancestor and therefore are likely to share a similar function.

Our research in protein function prediction also led to the development of novel methods for inference and structure discovery in biological networks. This included ClusterONE, an algorithm for detecting protein complexes from experimental data, and GOSSTO, a method for quantifying the functional similarity between two genes. 

Importantly, we applied these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes - the fundamental molecular machineries in the cell. 
We were able to obtain the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture. In total, we detected 622 complexes encompassing 2,634 distinct
proteins. Notably, the majority (62%; 385/622) of the complexes were previously unknown (i.e., only 237 were already present in curated public databases). This catalogue constitutes a first draft of human protein complexes and therefore it provides a glimpse into the global physical molecular organization of human cells.

An important output of this project is constituted by user-friendly and reliable software packages implementing the algorithms that we developed. We have created a piece of software for every algorithm developed in this project, namely: S2F, GFam, SCPS, ClusterONE, GOSSTO. These tools allow biologists and bioinformaticians to easily deploy our methods, without the need of re-implementing our algorithms. All our software packages are freely available for the scientific community as downloadable applications from the lab website. Some of our tools are also available as web applications hosted on our servers. The high number of downloads of our tools testifies their importance for the scientific community; for example ClusterONE has already been downloaded 4801 times.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The problem of protein function prediction is central in today's biology. Possible beneficiaries include:

1. The biological community at large, interested in comprehensive annotation of genomes.

2. The medical community, since elucidating human gene function can help us associate genes with certain human diseases.

3. Agriculture: predicting function for plant genes should enable us to design genetic methods to improve plant performance. Particularly, the signaling pathways on which we worked in this grant are important for plant adaptation to environmental changes.

4. Pharmaceutical companies looking to attack specific pathways.

These comparisons are important as they contribute to the inference of functional relationships between gene products by providing a perspective that complements both experimental information and sequence-based approaches. The proposed measure, which we call the random walk contribution (RWC) can be integrated with any standard semantic similarity measure, which we call host similarity measure (HSM), to yield an integrated similarity measure (ISM) that takes into account the whole ontology structure. In other words our random walk similarity measure is a kind of 'add on' to one's favourite underlying similarity measure.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3530BAC1-08D9-432D-81D7-6819D02E13A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One of the key steps in our Soluble Human Complexes project was the application of our Semantic Similarity method for calculating semantic similarities between human genes on the Gene Ontology.

We applied some of these methods within a collaboration project with the labs of Andrew Emili (University of Toronto) and Edward Marcotte (Universty of Texas, Austin) which was aimed at detecting human protein complexes.

In particular, for this project we deployed: ClusterONE, our algorithm for detecting overlapping protein complexes from PPI networks; GOSSTO, our method for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology; an information diffusion method we developed for denoising protein interaction data. 

The protein interaction networks identified experimentally in Emili's lab were enriched with networks generated using comparative genomics approaches in Marcotte's lab. Then, in my lab, we integrated this network with a semantic similarity graph (obtained using GOSSTO), applied our denoising procedure, and finally clustered the resulting graph using ClusterONE.

We thus obtained the largest catalogue to date of human protein complexes from cell culture.

The human protein complexes repository contains all the data generated in this study in an easily navigable format. These include all the pairwise protein interactions obtained through integration of the experimental data with public genomic evidence and the subunit composition of the 622 putative protein complexes obtained by clustering using ClusterONE.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5BE408AB-8455-4139-885D-A9769F2849CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The original publication where this dataset was first release has been cited, to date, more than 100 times (Google Scholar).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>SolubleComplexes</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://human.med.utoronto.ca/php/data_download.php</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Disease similarity measures quantify the distance between disease modules on the interactome.
