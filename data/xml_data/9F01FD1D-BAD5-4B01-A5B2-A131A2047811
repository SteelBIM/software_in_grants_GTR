This research examines the mechanisms that support successful word learning in young children.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Children are very good at forming a rough idea of what a new word means. For example, if shown a book and a novel electronic gadget and asked for the ?iPod? young children use process-of-elimination to link ?iPod? to the gadget. However, this is just the beginning. To really learn words children must form strong memories of the words and their meanings. &lt;br />&lt;br />Recently, we demonstrated that children only learn from process-of-elimination if ostensive naming is used. Ostensive naming involves naming something by making it very obvious what the word refers to, usually by holding up and pointing to the target object. This research builds on this finding and explores which aspects of ostensive naming make it so helpful. Experiment 1 explores highlighting the target object and decreasing children?s attention to all other objects. Experiment 2 explores the distances between the objects when they are being named. &lt;br />&lt;br />Overall this research will increase our understanding of mechanisms that support early word learning, when children are already speaking but still have a lot to learn. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-05-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>75633</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>How Preschool Children Learn from Storybooks (UCL)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B8013EC-FFB0-4C58-9677-8F23FCBFEDE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk to University College London, Language and Cognition Seminar Series.

Project, which encourages nursery staff and parents to read storybooks to children again and again. This project is inspired by my storybook research, which was not funded by this award, however, it relates to the general findings that does stem from this award. In September 2014 and January 2016, I visited Durham and spoke to both nursery staff participating in the project and, importantly, the early years coordinators at Durham County Council. In particular, I spent an entire day giving talks and answering questions about how 'less is more' for children's learning. I highlighted the research from this grant (in particular the Axelsson &amp;amp; Horst, 2014 paper) and how it relates to the work they are doing with children. I also encouraged them to see links between my ESRC-funded research and new findings in other educational domains from the US-all of which suggest that less is more when it comes to children's learning. Nursery staff in this scheme have reported children's increased interest in reading/books and improved concentration skills as a result of participating (to date 71 children's centres and nurseries are involved in the Again! project, some for the third round). The lead at Durham (C.L.) and I are discussing applying for additional funding to move this forward, i.e., implement this project more widely.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>231A5D91-AEB0-4EE0-8680-28B5DC582193</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of this project was to better understand how and why ostensive naming is beneficial for early word learning.

Results of this study were published as Axelsson, Churchley &amp;amp; Horst (2012, Frontiers in Psychology).

Study 2 focused on the influence of separating targets and competitors in physical space. Results of this study were published as Axelsson, Perry, Scott &amp;amp; Horst (2016, Acta Psychologica).

Study 3 explored the effect of competitors also being targets (ie being named). Results of this study are published as Axelsson &amp;amp; Horst (2013, Acta Psychologica).
