The impact of these is argued not to be as high and sustainable as expected, with the disease situation worsening in most developing countries, and health systems finding it even harder to cope. With declining funding for health research, due among other factors to the global economic crisis, the need for better ways to spend the available money has become more imperative. Our previous studies on the role of product development partnerships in global health innovation indicated that decision-making plays a key role in shaping the trajectory and impact of investments in health. This study explores the role of decision-making processes in availing new and innovative ways of spending money. 

The search for effective health delivery models is an on-going one. Until recently, this has been happening in the backdrop of increasing investment in innovation and public as well as private sector spending on health care research and development in health related areas such as pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, medical devices and health services. While the current global economic downturn has seen significant cuts being made to government, private sector and philanthropic funding for health research and health systems across the world, the health care sector remains one of the main recipients of funding from these sources. For example, according to one US study, only software spawns more new ventures receiving early-stage funding than the health field, and interestingly, a big proportion of the software ventures are for applications in health (The Economist, January 7 2010). Yet, despite all this enormous investment in innovation and the magnitude of the opportunity for innovators to both do good and do well, many efforts fail, losing billions of investor dollars along the way. 

Guided by the overarching research question 'what should money be spent on to make global health innovations more effective in Africa', this study uses two global health funders, two diseases and two countries as a multi-layered lens/window to gain theoretical, policy and practice insights into decision-making processes underpinning spending in health. Direct impact is envisaged on the funding agencies' decision making systems, and how these can be more effectively linked to the decision-making systems and health priorities of the recipient countries. The same direct impact is also foreseen for the recipient health systems with respect to convergence of decision-making and priority setting processes in the study countries and funding options available from funding agencies. The two diseases focused on, HIV/AIDS and malaria, have an immense impact on performance of the health systems of countries faced by these pandemics, to the extent that an improved understanding of funding mechanisms for mitigation of these challenges will undoubtedly be informative at a broader health system level. 

Direct and indirect impact on health spending decisions in other countries and other funding agencies will be achieved through policy and academic publications, and sharing of project findings through WHO channels, the project website, academic and policy conferences, and use of the researcher, mentor and advisory committee's exisiting and emerging networks. 

The study countries also enjoy a leadership position in health innovation across Africa, placing the study in a good position to yield results that will serve as impactful policy and practice lessons for many other countries in Africa and the developing world.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>163322</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of South Africa</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>ANOVA Health Institute South Africa, NEPAD South Africa, Citizens Health Watch Zimbabwe, COHRED (Geneva), WHO (Geneva), ANDI (Ethiopia), Ministry of Health and Child Care (Zimbabwe), Department of Health (South Africa), World Vision Zimbabwe, Academy for Quality Healthcare (South Africa)</gtr:description><gtr:id>85D00C69-48A7-4906-850D-DF7E528C2569</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Journal publications, review reports, workshop facilitation, joint presentations, discussions on joint bids</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>analysis of documents and contribution of innovation systems thinking as an analytical tool</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Access to and analysis of policy documents and decision making processes in global and local health

There is renewed realisation in both countries that the focus should not only be on raising more resources, but doing more with those available. New players are being considered and consulted in processes to decide how to deploy resources or structure health facilities. The roles and impact of different actors are also being revisited, e.g. the role of patients in shaping health delivery and the role of procurement experts in resource allocation. The need for up-date and where possible real-time data on system performance is critical, and was seen as one critical area that needs to be invested in so that decision-makers can be confident on where and how to deploy resources within the system at any given point in time

In the period 2016/17, there has been increasing interest in integrating the methodological aspects of the innovative spending in health work in some on-going academic, policy and practice work in South Africa and Zimbabwe, as well as in Tanzania. Citizens Health Watch and the Ministry of Health in Zimbabwe are carefully reexamining health delivery policies, practices and financing options with a view to seeing how impact from them can be enhanced. The Academy for Quality Healthcare in South Africa is working closely with the project PI to assess synergies between private and public hospitals in Mpumalanga Province and on innovative ways of embedding patient safety in clinical systems. In Tanzania the Science Technology and Innovation Policy Research Organization (STIPRO) is working with the PI to apply the concept of innovative spending in agricultural systems. At the University of Pretoria, discussions with a professor in the graduate school of technology management are progressing towards recruiting a student to apply the concept in environment management.
Stakeholders in the medical devices and pharmaceutical industries in South Africa and Zimbabwe are also thinking and talking about innovative spending, particularly in their procurement and distribution practices. Documentation of this impact is part of an ongoing initiative funded internally by the OU</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>303ADA4D-872C-4C0B-ACCB-1BBF71B21FD1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A structured way of analysing and understanding how decisions on where to spend resources in health are made in low income countries. Details below:


1. What were the most significant achievements from the grant? 
? Significant new knowledge generated
This project generated new knowledge and new thinking beyond contemporary views on how to bring more resources into health systems. Stakeholders at various points of the health systems of the study countries, South Africa and Zimbabwe acknowledged and gave examples of how they can think more creatively about deploying resources within the health systems. 
? New or improved research methods or skills developed
The study helped to strengthen the researcher's use of multi-method approaches in data collection and analysis. New skills were gained in integrating data and views from different respondents and time frames within the health systems to identify significant points of agreement with respect to where and how resources should be deployed within the health systems for better impact. 
? Important or new research resources identified
The study identified the intricate links that health systems have with other formal and non-formal structures of the study countries, serving as both sources of and impediments to innovative health delivery. Identifying and engaging with respondents and activities in these diverse spaces proved to be an invaluable resource for the study's empirical inquiry into how resources can be better spent. 
? Important new research questions opened up
A number of new research questions emerged from the both process and findings of the study, among them being the following:
? How are standards being ensured in the innovation processes, and whose standards?
? What are the back-up arrangements? How are the innovations buffered/cushioned? Who is liable when innovations fail?
? Beyond explaining, can innovation systems be more predictive around how knowledge is gained, managed, exchanged, interpreted, integrated, and disseminated in health systems?

? Significant negative results or research paths closed off
The study had initially sought to identify and compare innovative spending in the two countries' health systems, but later chose to put less emphasis on comparison to allow context-led analyses to emerge. Further, instead of focusing only on health spending decisions around funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation &amp;amp; the Global Fund and three main health challenges namely HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria as initially envisaged, the study looked at health spending targeting broader sets of funders and health delivery challenges. This offered a wider scope for the empirical inquiry and allowed identification of diverse innovative spending practices from entire health systems in the two countries. There were no significant negative results. 
? Noteworthy new research networks, collaborations or partnerships
Existing partnerships with organisations such as the African Network for Drugs and Diagnostics Innovation (ANDI), the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and the Council on Health Research for Development were strengthened. New partnerships emerged with the World Health Organisation (Geneva and country offices), as well as with national ministries/departments of health, science &amp;amp; technology and finance; and with various other government departments, pharmaceutical industry, health care funders, health delivery facilities and civil society organisations. 
? Increase research capability generated from training delivered in specialist skills
This study afforded the researcher numerous opportunities to present the research process and findings in academic and policy forums in the study countries and other regions of the world. It also availed opportunities for the researcher to facilitate conference sessions for different health system stakeholders such as health care funders, pharmaceutical industry associations, drug regulatory authorities and patients' forums. This allowed knowledge exchange with these various stakeholders, validation of research process and findings, and an opening of new avenues of inquiry for the study. 
? Summary information 
Overall this study was a first to introduce the concept of innovative spending in health. Borrowing from this work, a PhD study employing the concept on transition to green economy was started in Oct 2015 in one of the study countries. With respect to findings, the study established that in the midst of many challenges embedded in and transcending health delivery, stakeholders at various points in the South African and Zimbabwean health systems are separately and collectively deploying various innovative responses to try and get the best value from limited and shrinking resources. These responses include but are not limited to innovative organisational, health staff training and deployment models, health data collection partnerships with mobile phone companies, decentralisation of diagnosis and treatment options for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), community involvement in management of health facilities and establishment of national health insurance (NHI) schemes in both countries.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings will have multi-sectoral impact through influencing how decision-makers shape ways and select options for making resources more effective

Findings have been shared and discussed with academic, policy and user audiences with an interest in health issues in the study countries and the UK. Methodologies for looking beyond innovative fundraising to thinking about how resources are spent have been considered in South Africa and Zimbabwe through influence from this project. New thinking beyond techno-centric innovations has also been inculcated among stakeholders in government departments, civil society bodies, health facilities and pharmaceutical companies

Study findings have already had an impact in the case study countries through policy and practice adjustments, e.g. on innovative use of hospital facilities for additional resource mobilisation; on role of health care funders in stimulating innovative health delivery; and on reflective thinking and action towards synergistic improvements. Different stakeholder categories including health facilities, health care funders, policy makers and pharmaceutical industry associations in both countries have taken the notion of innovative spending on board in their routines. Civil society, academia and government are also taking the study process and findings forward, focusing particularly on ensuring and embedding impact indicators in their processes. A PhD study has commenced in one of the study countries to apply the concept in studying the 'green economy' agenda, while a PhD study is also being proposed for investments in biotechnology governance in the southern African region. The project also initiated the formation of a Citizens' Health Watch organisation in one of the study countries, which is aiming to tap on individual and collective experiences of patients and carers in stimulating and sustaining innovative health delivery. 
The study process and findings will have immediate impact in the health sector and biotechnology governance processes (a PhD study being initiated there), but also in other sectors as the need for innovative and imaginative ways of spending diminishing resources continues unabated in the study countries, other low-and-middle-countries and globally.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A539A5CB-A2EC-4B03-A273-2B1E4907C615</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://dpp.open.ac.uk/people/julius-mugwagwa</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Assessing Outcomes and Impact of GALVMed's Policy and Advocacy Activities</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEF7797E-66B5-4800-B6EA-29748CDB0F4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work developed a framework for assessment of the qualitative impact of policy and advocacy work carried out by GALVmed, which is a global product development partnership for veterinary medicines.
