However, it is often not the genes themselves that are the targets of potential drugs, but the thousands of proteins encoded by these genes. In order to understand how proteins perform their various tasks, we need to know the structure of these proteins. The most effective technique for determining protein structure is X-ray crystallography which requires high quality crystals of the proteins. The current structural genomics/proteomics projects worldwide have set out to determine the structures of 100,000 proteins but in spite of investing considerable funds and effort, they have had limited success because obtaining crystals is a major bottleneck to progress. There is an urgent need for new and improved ways to enable the growth of crystals.The problem lies in either getting no crystals at all, or even more frustrating - getting crystals that are not of a high enough quality to allow structure determination. The ultimate means to obtain good crystals is to control their conception stage, i.e. the nucleation stage which is the first step that determines the entire crystallization process. This is not an easy task hence the Holy grail is to find a 'universal nucleant' - a substrate that would induce crystallization of any protein. Several substances such as minerals, human hair, silicas have been used as nucleants, but with limited success. PRPs can selectively recognize particular proteins and therefore are very likely to serve as the ideal nucleants because rather than use random materials as nucleants, it will be possible to prepare PRPs for each protein while it is in solution and then get it to crystallise using that PRP. The results of the protein crystallisation studies will enable optimization of the PRPs for general protein capture applications (e.g. protein extraction and protein biosensing). The PRP technology is still in its infancy and proper characterisation methods do not currently exist. The nucleation studies will allow an interesting route to the feedback of essential information regarding whether parameters such as crosslinking density and choice of monomers can lead to better PRP formation. Biosensors for proteins are currently expensive to develop because they require the use of expensive antibodies. Because of the biomimicry capabilities (and their potential to act as synthetic antibodies), PRPs potentially offer a route to the development of new low-cost biosensors for cancer markers and bioterrorism markers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>125174</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>North Carolina State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Integration of smart materials with pattern recognition and nanofabrication techniques for the development of novel electrochemical disease diagnostics.</gtr:description><gtr:id>643761EC-8B7B-4A85-AC56-DFBD86FCF735</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Papers:

USE - For purifying a protein or peptide; and in the preparation of a crystal (all claimed).

ADVANTAGE - Using thin films, a lower amount of protein is required, both for the imprinting and the crystallizing stage. The growth of a small number of high-quality crystals reduces number of exposed cavities. The processing step of passing the molecularly imprinted polymer through a sieve avoids the release of its template.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for screening for appropriate protein or peptide crystallization conditions involving providing a molecularly imprinted polymer imprinted with a first protein or peptide; conducting pairs of screening trials for a second protein or peptide, where each pair relating to a trial under a different one of several different sets of conditions, and one member of each pair including the molecularly imprinted polymer in a solution of the second protein or peptide and the corresponding other member of the pair including no molecularly imprinted polymer; determining the conditions under which nucleation of the second protein or peptide occurs in the trials that include the molecularly imprinted polymer, but under which no nucleation occurs in the corresponding trials including no molecularly imprinted polymer, thereby identifying metastable conditions for the second protein or peptide; and/or determining the conditions under which nucleation of the second protein or peptide occurs in the trials that include no molecularly imprinted polymer, but under which nucleation occurs at a faster rate in the corresponding trials including the molecularly imprinted polymer, thereby identifying nucleation conditions for the second protein or peptide.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D55EAF0F-978C-4C9A-AFCF-DFA27922D6E7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Collaboration with other groups who wish to crystallize 'hard to crystallize' proteins in Brazil.

MIPs, also referred to as &amp;quot;smart materials,&amp;quot; are made to contain cavities capable of rebinding protein; thus the fingerprint of the protein created on the polymer allows it to serve as an ideal template for crystal formation.
We have shown that six different MIPs induced crystallization
of nine proteins, yielding crystals in conditions that do not give crystals otherwise. The incorporation of MIPs in screening experiments gave rise to crystalline hits in 8-10% of the trials for three target proteins. These hits would have been missed using other known nucleants. MIPs also facilitated the formation of large single crystals at metastable conditions for seven proteins. Moreover, the presence of MIPs has led to faster formation of crystals in all cases where crystals would appear eventually and to major improvement in diffraction in some cases. The MIPs were effective for their cognate proteins and also for other proteins, with size compatibility being a likely criterion for efficacy. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements demonstrated specific affinity between the
MIP cavities and a protein-functionalized AFM tip, corroborating our hypothesis that due to the recognition of proteins by the cavities, MIPs can act as nucleation-inducing substrates (nucleants) by harnessing the proteins themselves as templates.

We have characterized the imprinting capability of a
family of acrylamide polymer-based molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) for bovine hemoglobin (BHb) and trypsin (Tryp) using spectrophotometric and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor techniques. Bulk gel characterization on acrylamide (AA), Nhydroxymethylacrylamide (NHMA), and N-isopropylacrylamide (NiPAM) gave varied selectivities when compared with control polymers. We have also harnessed the ability of the MIPs to facilitate protein crystallization as a means of evaluating their selectivity for cognate and noncognate proteins. Crystallization trials indicated improved crystal formation in the order NiPAM &amp;lt; AA &amp;lt; NHMA. QCM studies of thin film MIPs confirm this trend with Nhydroxymethyl acrylamide MIPs exhibiting best discrimination between MIP and NIP and also cognate/noncognate protein loading. Equivalent results for acrylamide MIPs suggested that the cavities were equally selective for both proteins, while N-isopropylacrylamide MIPs were not selective for either cognate BHb or noncognate BSA. All BHb MIP-QCM sensors based on AA, NHMA, or NiPAM were essentially nonresponsive to smaller, noncognate proteins. Protein crystallization studies validated the hydrophilic efficacy of MIPS indicated in the QCM studies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Through Imperial Innovations, we are marketing MIP crystallization kits (a joint venture between University of Surrey and Imperial College, London).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EC884226-450F-4627-A6A3-E6D07DBA1FA7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Education,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.imperialinnovations.co.uk/license/available-technologies/chayen-reddy-mip/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/54597EC3-826B-4984-B691-86A887276C44"><gtr:id>54597EC3-826B-4984-B691-86A887276C44</gtr:id><gtr:title>Enhanced selectivity of hydrogel-based molecularly imprinted polymers (HydroMIPs) following buffer conditioning.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Analytica chimica acta</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2b9742cdf098a9a09370e7f193f6c482"><gtr:id>2b9742cdf098a9a09370e7f193f6c482</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>El-Sharif HF</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0003-2670</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/61BC81D1-51D5-4BF3-8D35-D9758C0E0DBD"><gtr:id>61BC81D1-51D5-4BF3-8D35-D9758C0E0DBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Spectroscopic and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) characterisation of protein-based MIPs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/86571d0c756396a9c2e2423fa2e8b079"><gtr:id>86571d0c756396a9c2e2423fa2e8b079</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>EL-Sharif H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/55EE6CD2-9587-49EA-BA8F-7C7FAC3A3482"><gtr:id>55EE6CD2-9587-49EA-BA8F-7C7FAC3A3482</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein crystallization and biosensor applications of hydrogel-based molecularly imprinted polymers.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biomacromolecules</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/240737ba32989aaff50e6a1aa5f151eb"><gtr:id>240737ba32989aaff50e6a1aa5f151eb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reddy SM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1525-7797</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A595E417-69F8-45BA-998E-71CF2DF30D86"><gtr:id>A595E417-69F8-45BA-998E-71CF2DF30D86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Protein detection using hydrogel-based molecularly imprinted polymers integrated with dual polarisation interferometry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6a043778989d40c7027febcb0d07ad2f"><gtr:id>6a043778989d40c7027febcb0d07ad2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reddy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F061202D-EF77-4DD4-9D19-52128956A7B4"><gtr:id>F061202D-EF77-4DD4-9D19-52128956A7B4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Electrochemical probing of selective haemoglobin binding in hydrogel-based molecularly imprinted polymers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Electrochimica Acta</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6a043778989d40c7027febcb0d07ad2f"><gtr:id>6a043778989d40c7027febcb0d07ad2f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reddy S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9A2ABCF5-F775-4EFC-80C9-1EC46B7BF648"><gtr:id>9A2ABCF5-F775-4EFC-80C9-1EC46B7BF648</gtr:id><gtr:title>Automating the application of smart materials for protein crystallization.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Acta crystallographica.
