In substance misuse treatment, one in six males have perpetrated IPV and one in four females are IPV victims, resulting in higher involvement with criminal justice, child protection and mental health services. Few interventions address IPV among this group and those that have been developed are from the US. There is great division over the importance and appropriateness of individual, situational, cultural and societal factors in explaining IPV.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The seminar series will advance our cross-cultural, multidisciplinary understanding about the causes of IPV among substance misusers. Six seminars (three to be held in the UK, one in the US, one in China and one in Australia) will explore the relationship between IPV and substance misuse, the consequences and causes of IPV, and sociological considerations of IPV and substance misuse, including gender and culture. How best to address IPV among substance misusers will be debated by discussing risk and assessment criteria, treatment approaches, novel technologies and public policy. Early career researchers and PhD students will be encouraged and supported to present their work and collaborate on dissemination and research proposal development.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A wide range of non-academic professionals &amp;amp; practitioners will benefit from the proposed seminar series including health &amp;amp; social care professionals, GPs, police &amp;amp; criminal justice systems, policy makers, organisations, charities &amp;amp; service user groups representing victims &amp;amp; perpetrators of IPV &amp;amp;/or people with substance misuse problems. 

Many of these representatives previously attended the Centre for Applied Social Research Centre's annual lecture on addressing IPV in substance misuse treatment, &amp;amp; have expressed an interest in being involved in the seminar series. The format of the seminars will ensure a continuous learning approach to understanding the role of substance misuse &amp;amp; IPV &amp;amp; why some people are more likely to be victims or perpetrators of IPV than others. It will provide evidence-based solutions &amp;amp; practice to effectively addressing these dual problems through the presentation of ground breaking research &amp;amp; the inclusion of practical problem solving through the use of clinical case vignettes &amp;amp; the discussion workshops on the implications of the findings on their future practice &amp;amp; policy. 

Discussions will cover a number of themes including the aetiology of co-occurring IPV &amp;amp; substance misuse, different social &amp;amp; cultural experiences &amp;amp; expectations, the role of substance misuse in IPV, &amp;amp; evidence based policy &amp;amp; practice to addressing these co-occurring issues in an integrated manner. These have been identified as ongoing issues for practitioners &amp;amp; policy-makers. The seminar series will address these &amp;amp; other relevant issues identified during the seminar workshops from academic &amp;amp; practitioner perspectives, allowing the seminar series to evolve as required to address the needs of potential beneficiaries. 

Seminar 1 provides beneficiaries with a greater understanding of the size of the problem &amp;amp; the consequences of IPV which may impact on the way they assess &amp;amp; respond to substance misusers, taking care to screen for IPV &amp;amp; examine other associated comorbid issues. Seminar 2 assists with the understanding of why some people are more likely to perpetrate IPV. By debating existing theories &amp;amp; reaching an agreed understanding, previous views may be challenged which may result in a change in practice &amp;amp; policy that enhances the treatment response for substance misusers who are victims or perpetrators of IPV. In Seminar 3, the differing typologies of perpetrators will be considered &amp;amp; discussed in relation to treatment approaches &amp;amp; needs. Seminar 4 examines the differences cross-cultural beliefs about IPV &amp;amp; the role of substance misuse in IPV perpetration. Cross-cultural comparative analysis of the legal and policy contexts will be provided. This will assist beneficiaries understand the cross-cultural perspectives of their patients/clients &amp;amp; provide an improved cross-culturally appropriate response as a result. The final two seminars examine how to improve treatment access, engagement &amp;amp; retention &amp;amp; present ground breaking research on behavioural therapies &amp;amp; novel technologies to effectively address these dual problems. Knowledge exchange will ensure an improved treatment response for substance misusers, which could result in a reduction of IPV &amp;amp; improvements in well-being for the victims &amp;amp; other family members. 

Each of the 6 seminars is designed to reflect practitioners' current concerns &amp;amp; those issues that are currently being debated &amp;amp;/or addressed in academic research. The series will also benefit policy-makers, commissioners &amp;amp; education providers as improved understandings of these issues can influence the way in which professionals &amp;amp; agencies design policy and training responses. 

The availability of the seminar series via video conferencing, live streaming &amp;amp; captured on the research seminar series website will ensure the wide dissemination of the outputs. The website will be publicised via existing academic/professional networks. It will also facilitate collaborations between practitioners &amp;amp; academics</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30365</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to Public Health England</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3788BAA0-3907-47FB-83EF-285D575B1081</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present at Public Health England event, National Intelligence Network on drug health harms; on 22 October 2014.

Each seminar included a session for debate and discussion. In addition, the core team of researchers had time to develop grants and academic papers. Pod/vodcasts are available of the 6 seminars on the project website free-to-download. The seminar series led to the publication of 2 special issues on Intimate partner violence and substance use - one in Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cbm.v25.4/issuetoc (and an editorial) and the other for Drug and Alcohol Review (ongoing). In addition 6 competitive grants have been submitted as a result of collaborations formed in the seminar series: 2 NIHR programme grants (decision pending); 1 NIHR HTA (unsuccessful); 1 ESRC PhD studentship (awarded); 1 NIHR post-doctoral fellowship (unsuccessful); 1 Hong Kong University grant application (unsuccessful).

The seminar series has resulted in the Principal Investigator guest editing a special issue of Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health on domestic violence. The co-investigators along with the Principal Investigator will write an editorial for this special issue planned for 2015.
