This is clearly demonstrated by the significant investment in the Crossrail project in London, UK. Tunnelling has evolved into a sophisticated construction process involving the use of automated equipment and specialist materials. The use of modern methods does not, however, prevent the unavoidable result of ground deformations caused by tunnelling. In modern cities, where underground space is limited due to the abundance of buried infrastructure, it is important to understand the effects of tunnelling on nearby buried infrastructure and above-ground structures.

The analysis of the effect of tunnelling on above-ground structures is an extremely complex soil-structure interaction problem. The problem involves the behaviour of the tunnel, the soil, the above-ground structure, and the highly non-linear interactions that occur between the soil and structural components. Analysis of individual domains (i.e. the soil or structure in isolation) can provide some indication of overall behaviour but it does not give a true representation of the global system. Modern design and research tools, such as numerical and geotechnical centrifuge modelling, have the ability to accurately model the soil or structural domains individually but struggle to replicate the global behaviour of large complex systems involving soil-structure interactions.

This project will develop a method in which geotechnical centrifuge and numerical modelling techniques are coupled together in such a way as to take full advantage of the respective strengths of each technique in order to obtain an accurate global solution to the tunnel-building interaction problem. 

The project considers a specific scenario in which a tunnel is constructed beneath a building on a piled foundation. The University of Nottingham geotechnical centrifuge is used to model the tunnel-soil-piled foundation domain. The geotechnical centrifuge allows testing of small-scale models of full-scale prototypes within a controlled laboratory environment and replicates complex soil and soil-structure interaction behaviour. The centrifuge is necessary to increase the weight of the soil in the small-scale model so that ground stresses and behaviour in the model match those in the full-scale prototype; for example a 0.1m deep section of soil in the centrifuge model weighs the same as 10m of the same prototype soil when the centrifuge is spun to give an acceleration field equivalent to 100 times earth's gravity in the model. The centrifuge model can provide a more realistic simulation of the tunnelling induced displacements and resulting soil-structure interactions than a numerical model.

For the tunnel-building problem, a numerical model is used to solve the foundation-building domain. Various complexities of this domain are considered, such as the building-foundation connections, building stiffness, and material behaviour. The numerical model will provide an accurate simulation of a building which would be very difficult to achieve in a scaled centrifuge model.

The centrifuge and numerical models will be coupled through a data interfacing system which will pass information of pile displacements and loads between the models in real-time. This interfacing means that the interactions between the physical model in the centrifuge and the numerical model are captured and that the global tunnel-soil-foundation-building system behaviour is modelled correctly.

The successful completion of this project will represent a significant step in improving modelling methods to study the tunnel-structure interaction problem and will provide valuable information to help improve the understanding of this complex and important construction scenario.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short-term, the main beneficiary of the research will be academic. This line of research has the potential to significantly impact the way in which soil-structure interaction problems are analysed. The research will provide valuable data which will enhance the understanding of these complex problems and enable the development of better analytical design tools which can be used in industry. 

The global analysis method proposed in the research provides a link between geotechnics and structures, the importance of which was highlighted in the 2009 EPSRC Review of Ground and Structural Engineering. The multi-disciplinary team included in the project will ensure that the work encompasses the important aspects from both soils and structures.

The research will help to develop an appreciation in the importance of taking a multi-disciplinary view of complex problems. The expertise gained by the research team will be extremely valuable and will hopefully lead to further developments. The skills and experience acquired by the early career researchers involved in this project will assist in their long-term development.

In the long-term, this research has the potential to provide significant economic benefits to the construction industry. The data and understanding acquired from this research will assist in the development of improved analytical and numerical design tools which may give the UK a competitive advantage. 

The research has several societal beneficiaries. Specific to the proposed research, providing a better understanding of tunnel-structure interactions will enhance public safety and ensure that the development of public infrastructure (such as tunnels for trains, water, waste, electricity, etc.) is not hampered by technical hurdles. The safe and effective provision of underground infrastructure has a direct benefit to public health and quality of life. On a broader theme, the enhancement of our ability to understand complex soil-structure interaction problems will benefit many sectors of industry and society, including energy (e.g improving design of offshore wind turbine and oil and gas platform foundations in deep water).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>University UCAS day presentations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF181FDD-60F0-4C6A-9FC1-EFADDC350D6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During University UCAS days, the importance of centrifuge modelling at Nottingham Centre for Geomechanics as well as this specific project has been disseminated to the public.

To overcome these limitations, the real-time substructure testing approach was extended to centrifuge modelling. It consists of performing a scale physical test of the geotechnical domain (where non-linear or complex behaviour is expected), and coupling this experimental data in real time to a numerical model of the remaining domain by means of a real-time data acquisition and load-control interface. This approach enhances centrifuge modelling capabilities by taking full advantage of the strengths of structural numerical modelling. 
This novel method was used to study soil-structure interaction problems resulting from the excavation of tunnels beneath piled buildings. The proposed method uses a finite element model to simulate a generic framed structure whereas the tunnel-ground-foundation system and the structural loads are modelled within the centrifuge.</gtr:description><gtr:id>63B4140D-5071-4199-93C5-F391BC38B6F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcomes of the hybrid modelling illustrated interaction mechanisms that, if considered, can lead to optimised design of new tunnels in urban areas.
