In spintronics the quantum-mechanical angular momentum, or spin, of the electron is used as a two-state variable for encoding, transporting, manipulating, and sensing digital information. Since the advent of spintronics hard disk readback sensors evolved through several generations of `magnetoresistance' technology. Magnetoresistance describes a large change in electrical resistance in response to a magnetic field which encodes data onto the disk. The current state-of-the-art device is a planar structure consisting of two magnetic layers separated by an insulating layer less than 1 nm thick, with sensing properties determined by the detailed physical layer structuring of the device, and its constituent materials, at an atomic level - the crystalline structure is key to the functionality. However, the ever-increasing data storage density demanded for modern applications means that this technology is nearing its limit. Further improving this technology to accommodate data density beyond 1 Tb/sq-in requires smaller devices and lower device resistances, in order that the head may sense smaller data bits at a higher data throughput. Achieving both of these goals together necessitates reduction in the thickness of the insulating layer. As this layer is only a few atoms thick in state-of-the-art devices, this will soon no longer be possible; the rapid increase in digital data storage density demanded by technologically advanced society can no longer continue unless a new sensor technology is developed. A novel candidate technology has been suggested, based upon theoretical prediction of novel physics - quantum-coherent spin-dependent electron scattering resulting in the `quasimomentum-filtered giant magnetoresistance' (QF-GMR) effect. QF-GMR also depends intimately on the atomic scale structure of a hybrid device, now consisting of two magnetic layers, separated by a nanoscale non-magnetic spacer, and deposited onto an engineered semiconductor electrode; it is the logical next-generation spintronic device paradigm. Electrons emitted from the semiconductor have constrained lateral wavevector, or quasimomentum, due to the low semiconductor carrier density. This `filtered' quasimomentum results in strongly spin-selective transmission across the structure, producing orders-of-magnitude larger magnetoresistance. The absence of an insulating layer reduces the device resistance sufficiently for increasing data density; readback sensors based on QF-GMR should enable the continued increase in digital data storage density for years to come - 'more-Moore' improvement, continuing Moore's law. In addition to readback heads there are many areas of technology where devices based on QF-GMR may find application; potentially providing 'more-than-Moore' performance gains via novel functionality or architectures. Efficient microwave and spin-wave generation for 'magnonic' computing, spin-transfer torque diodes for sensitive radio-frequency current detection, and novel metallic devices based on quantum-well resonances are such potential applications. So-far no experimental demonstration of the predicted QF-GMR effect exists. This project primarily aims to provide such a demonstration, gain further understanding of the novel physics behind the QF-GMR, and advance sensor devices based on QF-GMR from theory toward future technological application. This research will demonstrate that QF-GMR devices may be a cost-effective solution to the problems in increasing data storage density which the hard disk industry will soon face, and also for future memory, radio-frequency and spin-wave communications and processing technologies based on quantum-wells and spin-transfer torque.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Should the proposed research objectives be fully achieved, the potential academic, economic, and societal benefits may include:

Academic impact - The PI will have defined a new spintronic device paradigm, and a novel experimental research field fabricating and studying quantum-coherent conduction in magnetic metals. This topic has huge potential applicability to the magnetic data-storage and microelectronics industries, and the PI should be established as one of the world leaders in this new field.
Economic impact - The global hard-disk data storage industry generated total revenues of over USD 31 billion in 2011 and continues to grow year-on-year (source: IDC Worldwide Quarterly Disk Storage Systems Tracker). This industry is approaching a situation where the continued growth in data-storage capacity can no longer be sustained without a new enabling readback-head technology. As a result of this research programme, the PI will have demonstrated and developed just such a technology. The direct integration of semiconductors into the device design makes these devices ideally suited also to magnetic random access memory and novel processing elements. The market revenues for magnetic random-access memory, currently an emerging niche technology, was estimated to be USD 12.9 billion in 2011, with strong year-on-year growth (source: Forbes, inc). In addition to data-storage, memory and processing, devices based on the novel physics demonstrated in this project will be suited to applications as sources and detectors for future on-chip microwave communications and mobile communications technologies. These devices should have far superior performance in comparison to devices based on existing technologies. The factory revenue for the global mobile communications market was over USD 340 billion in 2011 and also continues to grow year-on-year (source: IHS iSupply Wireless Systems Market Tracker). Durham University may choose to license intellectual property relevant to device technologies, developed as a result of this programme, to the large multinational microelectronics and hard-disk manufacturers. The successful commercialisation of the results of this research would also attract investment from these industries to the PI's research group and institution, and may attract investment from these industries in developing research and manufacturing bases in the UK.
Societal impact - The impact of ever-improving digital data storage on society over the past 20 years has been vast, enabling sectors which are crucially important to the UK's digital economy. The internet now enables instant access to information from around the globe. TV and radio have switched from analog to digital, including on-demand, services. Commercial transactions and personal finances are now processed digitally. The information revolution is underpinned by the ability to store and access vast quantities of digital data, enabled by cheap high-density magnetic hard-disk data storage. The success of this research programme will lead to a new technology enabling even higher density digital data-storage; enabling novel data-intensive internet and information technologies, in addition to the emergence of new and enhanced consumer technologies such as beyond-high-definition video and lossless high-fidelity storage. Fast, cheap, ultra-high density media can further enable societally beneficial technologies where analysis of large quantities of digital data is required such as medical imaging, genome mapping, seismology, and climate science. Application of this technology to microwave communications may result in improved performance and reduced energy consumption for mobile phones, and novel short-range data communication technologies. On-chip radio-frequency communications could produce low-power, high speed data transfer for personal computers and data-servers, and applications as transducers and detectors for magnonics could advance this new data-processing paradigm.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>93149</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>14800</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Overseas Development Assistance</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>415ADCCA-024B-440A-B01E-DC22BB472F9B</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-02-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>128000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Mexico, United Mexican States</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>National Council on Science and Technology (CONACYT)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Overseas scholarship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2020-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of Mexico</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A64C7C2B-CB76-4AB3-A718-EE2D92577413</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed instrumentation to examine crystal structure of nanometer-thick films during a technologically relevant vacuum fabrication process.
