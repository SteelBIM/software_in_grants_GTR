Situated (place-time), and therapeutic narratives.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J012181/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will conduct a review of a range of work which has taken place in recent years in arts and humanities and related subjects into how communities in the UK, and beyond, are affected by, and cope with, issues such as flooding and related questions of water security. The research seeks to explore how &amp;quot;community&amp;quot; has been envisaged in that work, and what insights thinking about communities and flooding and related water issues can bring to other approaches to communities, and how other theories and approaches to community can feed back into work on water and other environmental issues. Communities are seen as complex and contested formations, which do not simply or easily correspond to notions of place and settlement. But the research aims to explore how physical location, and environmental processes and hazards such as floods can have impacts on populations who share locations and neighbourhoods. What lessons can be leanrt from this?

There have been a series of very significant floods in the UK (e.g. Boscastle 2004; Carlisle 2005; Gloucestershire and Hull 2007; Cumbria 2009 ) which have clearly had dramatic and long lasting impacts on affected communities which include economic impacts, health and well being impacts, and also how the community sees itself and how it is embedded in the landscape and in wider society. The government response to the challenge of planning for flood risk management, as in the Pitt Review (2008), focuses very much on community preparedness, and developing community resilience as part of a wider range of measures in developing flood risk response. Climate change scenarios, which include possible sea level rise and more extreme rainfall events, coupled with pressure to build new homes, means that questions of how communities live with the risk of flooding (and other water issues) will remain high on the political and academic agenda. Alongside flooding there are also other important concerns about water security issues at the community level which include drought (as in Eastern England 2011) and how water catchment areas are effectively managed for assets such as biodiversity and ecosystem services. 

All these approaches to communities and water issues raise a host of questions about what communities are, how they 'work' (or don't work), the extent to which a locational issue such as flooding creates community in a local population who, in other senses, might not function as a cohesive community. Thinking about community through water issues asks questions about how they are connected internally and externally (e.g. to other communities which share a river catchment area).

The research will develop ideas of &amp;quot;situated narratives&amp;quot;: how communities develop stories of their collective environmental past, present and future in landscape. These changes can be about community relations with environmental issues such as water security and also about changes in how the community itself works and how it is connected to other communities. This kind of work can be supported by local agencies and institutions (e.g. local museums) and also through social media networks.

The research will also develop ideas of &amp;quot;therapeutic narratives&amp;quot;: - how arts and humanities based research and practice (e.g. creative writing, photography, oral history) can help communities come to terms not only with challenging water issues and experiences, such as flooding, but also begin to develop new insights and empathies into relationships within their community and with neighbouring communities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The focus on crosscutting understandings of communities in general and how various disciplines and initiatives have considered communities and water issues (and other environmental issues) will have impact for the following stakeholders: 

Those seeking to develop community well being and the effectiveness of public services and policy, and enhancing quality of life, health and creative output in relation to communities. 

Private sector beneficiaries will include stakeholder organisations with interest in economic aspects of resilience particularly insurance companies and their representative bodies.

public sector beneficiaries, policy-makers, government and government agencies will include a range of governmental and ngo agencies with interests in community well-being and resilience and also in various aspects of sustainable environmental management, including those charged with climate change scenario planning

third sector agencies will include museums and other organisations which might have a role in developing and disseminating community narratives 

the emphasis on therapeutic narratives will be of interest to a range of actors who might seek to work with communities, including artists, and third sector agencies involved in 'big society' type infinitives

There is a need for - and growing trend of - considering communities in ways which recognise their embeddedness in landscapes/places which are formed of ecological communities, material actors, processes and agencies. 
? Re-envisioning communities in this way asks a series of questions about the connectivities, disconnectivities and conflicts within and between communities be they topographically (place) based and/or topologically (networked, interest) based. 
? Flooding (and other 'single issue' foci in sustainability/resilience/transition studies) should be considered with other interdependent socio-ecological issues.
? Flooding, when seen in wider/alternative cultural and ecological frameworks, can be seen in more positively as a process with cultural, ecological and economic benefits if planned for appropriately. 
? Arts and humanities (a&amp;amp;h) led methods can play key roles in multiple 'negotiations' within and between community, science, policy, and biophysical processes.
? Narrative based approaches are emerging to address a range of eco-social conflicts and challenges facing communities and governance delivered policy. 
? Further development of situated, therapeutic and digital narratives offer considerable potential in extending the above.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This scoping studied contributed to the development of the Connected Communites Environments and Sustainability Large Grant. &amp;quot;Towards hydrocitizenship.

From the 2017 Festival evaluation 

&amp;quot;WVRF2016 encompassed 28 events, at 28 venues on sites from Hereford to Chepstow.
We exceeded all our targets: Achieving 29,800+people attending events. 1,200 school children were involved in our workshop programme. In addition 1,098 children had Wye Serai school visits with the Ensemble for half a day each.
539 young people worked with artists to create the flags which decorated the Festival sites. 
A further 300+ People participated in community training/workshops. 1000 origami birds were made by over200local people from a variety of community groups which were used in one of the installations. A whole community, young and old contributed to the other installation. 
328 people took part in the walking/story project.
220+ local singers, musicians and performers were involved in the performances 
250+torchbearers were involved in the Llandogo procession with a further 
50 volunteer torchbearers involved throughout the Festival. 
In all 18 local youth theatre groups, choirs and bands took part in the performances. 
20 students form University of South Wales were involved with the project 15 of which went on to produce performances for the Festival as part of their degree assessments.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wyevalleyaonb.org.uk/images/uploads/general/WVRF_2016_Evaluation_and_Reflection_Report_FINAL.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship on-line community to be used as a model for a new international network on permaculture/forest gardens</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>077C8D29-A358-4B5E-AE04-6AB2A0F20D2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On seeing a presentation about the Hydrocitizenship project a researcher from the Open University is to use the Hydrocitizenship on-line community model for a new research network
