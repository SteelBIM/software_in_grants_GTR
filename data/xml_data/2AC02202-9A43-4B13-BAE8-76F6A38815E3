The core of the collection consists of the Arundel marbles, but the museum has made further acquisitions since the seventeenth century, most recently of inscriptions from the estate of the late Sir Howard Colvin. The main publication of the collection is that of Chandler (1763), who included the 134 inscriptions then owned by the museum. No modern edition of the collection exists. No photographic record of the inscriptions has ever been published. The inscriptions originate from Britain and other parts of the Roman world and date from the late Republic down to mediaeval times. The collection includes a wide range of types of inscriptions: many are monumental inscriptions such as epitaphs, religious dedications, and commemorative building-inscriptions, but many more are inscribed upon everyday objects, including pewterware, pottery, and even a set of panpipes. None of the inscriptions on its own is of any especial historical consequence, but together they offer insights into the Roman world, its commemorative habits, social hierarchy, economic networks, and uses of literacy. Specifically too, the place of the frontier province of Britain within the cultural, social, religious, and economic networks of the wider Roman empire can be illustrated by the inscriptions found there.
Despite the fact that they offer a direct line of communication with the ancient world, Latin inscriptions seem inaccessible and incomprehensible to the general public. This project aims to create an online corpus and critical edition of the museum's collection of inscriptions for a scholarly readership, and then to use this as a springboard for further online resources and interactive activities, and to incorporate more Latin inscriptions into the museum's displays in order to open up this type of first-hand source material to as wide an audience as possible. It will show how Latin inscriptions can illuminate the society, economy, and religion of the past, and will explore the ways in which Latin continued to be used in Britain even after the end of 'Roman Britain'.
As well as containing a research core relating to Roman history and to the history of collections and museums, this project will make a valuable contribution to understanding better how digital resources can be embedded into different contexts peopled by professional scholars, students, teachers, schoolchildren, &amp;amp; museum-visitors. The AHRC has been at the forefront of funding innovative digital epigraphic projects, such as Inscriptions of Aphrodisias &amp;amp; MAMA XI, and of supporting new imaging techniques via the project e-Science and Ancient Documents. These projects have clearly demonstrated the advantages of publication in EpiDoc XML, but we wish to explore this potential further in several ways: by exploring the integration of an EpiDoc corpus into a Museum's cataloguing system; by discovering how it can be used to enhance current displays within the Museum; by seeing how the XML can be used to produce teaching resources for use by institutions elsewhere. In particular, it will seek to put into practice the potential in EpiDoc to produce resources suitable for the visually impaired.
Several audiences will be the potential beneficiaries of this project. Visitors to the museum will be able to engage more easily with the Latin inscriptions on display; interactive activities will target schoolchildren. Schools will be able to use new online resources in the Education Centre during their visits to the museum and to engage in follow-up activities afterwards. Students and scholars will be able to access the electronic EpiDoc corpus of the inscriptions. By publishing an electronic corpus, the museum's collection will be made accessible to a worldwide audience, and it will be possible to integrate its data into the existing major online databases of Latin inscriptions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impact of this project beyond academia is potentially huge, involving the museum-visiting public resident in the UK, foreign visitors, schoolchildren, and students. The Ashmolean Museum itself will of course benefit from engaging a wide audience in another element of its extensive collections. Exploring new ways of displaying Latin inscriptions and engaging museum visitors actively in viewing them and appreciating their importance for our understanding of the Roman world will also make a significant contribution to ongoing discussions of how museums should display such material (cf. SEBarc (2009) on Museographia epigraphica). 
The incorporation of more Latin inscriptions into various spaces within the museum will widen accessibility to Latin epigraphy for the thousands who visit the museum each year. We intend to display roughly forty additional inscriptions within existing gallery spaces relating to the themes of Reading and Writing, Human Image, and Rome, as well as the Randolph Gallery illustrating the Arundel collection. Interactive activities will be designed to engage more of the visitors, especially children, in the inscriptions on display. Some of these activities will be high-tech, allowing visitors to view inscriptions via reflectance transformation imaging, whilst others will be low-tech thematic trails around the galleries for younger visitors. We also aim to realise the potential of EpiDoc for creating resources suitable for the visually impaired, something which no other project has yet put into practice. Extending the existing Online Collections website to include the museum's Latin inscriptions will allow visitors to the museum to find out more after their visit, as well as making the inscriptions available to anyone else who wishes to investigate the collection of Latin inscriptions without actually travelling to Oxford. Inscriptions offer a unique perspective into the ancient world, as both texts and objects with a voice. This impact would take immediate effect following the project's completion.
Thousands of schoolchildren visit the museum each year: the outputs will enrich their studies of the Roman world and extend their appreciation of another culture and society. Looking at Latin inscriptions will introduce them to an alien culture, focusing on themes such as slavery, non-nuclear family structures, and ancient religious practices. The gallery and online resources could also have a significant outreach impact, in introducing to the Latin language children who do not learn it at school. This will enable them to develop an appreciation of how language shapes a society: on a simple level, for example, they could consider why tombstones commonly evoked the spirits of the dead (di manes), and how that might differ from today's practices. For KS1 pupils, the project will fulfil the National Curriculum aim that 'They learn how the past is different from the present'. It will also facilitate engagement in Historical Enquiry of 'how to find out about the past from a range of sources of information' by showing them how material objects can offer insight into the Roman world. For KS2 pupils, the inscriptions could play a part in investigating the Romans in Britain. The collection of Latin inscriptions would also be of direct use to pupils studying for OCR GCSE Classical Civilisation and Ancient History, opting for the Roman Britain module (Unit A354 Option 6) and for A level Ancient History (A2 Unit CC7 (Entry Code F387): Roman Britain: life in the outpost of the Empire and AS Unit CC6 (Entry Code F386): City Life in Roman Italy). For example, some of these inscriptions illuminate the presence of the Roman army in Britain; others could be used to explore towns and villas in Roman Britain. The project will also facilitate pupils in exploring 'the definition of social identity through public buildings and inscriptions in public places'. This impact would take immediate effect following the project's completion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>575745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Installation of Latin inscriptions into the following galleries in the Ashmolean: Rome; Randolph; Reading &amp;amp; Writing; Mediterranean</gtr:description><gtr:id>A1D69F82-44B9-42AE-BE96-F7AC1A884EAD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Installation of Latin inscriptions has enriched educational possibilities of the displays in the museum, and have been actively promoted via the project's programmes of teacher-training sessions, and via public tours and lectures in the museum.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Gallery installations, Ashmolean Museum</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oxford Preservation Trust Open Doors Event - poster display, Classics Centre, Oxford</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29CF3B26-742D-4506-9322-E33136D09AAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oxford Preservation Trust Open Doors Event by project RF Jane Masseglia, 12th September 2015, AshLI Project poster in Ioannou Atrium</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Primary school workshop (Our Lady's Catholic Primary School, Cowley)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C30D487-BAA1-4383-B0B4-9E32329EE7B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AshLI primary school workshop led by Abigail Baker.

Members of the public commissioned our 'scribes' to write out 500 columbarium plaques after viewing the procession (held twice). This meant that the public engaged with the structure of Latin inscriptions, and thought about Roman naming patterns, since they chose their own personalised names from our lists of suggested names.

Improved upon sessions in 2014, since gave the PGCE trainees on-site training, thanks to support from Warwick Impact Fund (covered travel expenses for the participants). Intend to continue this event for future years.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PGCE training for secondary Classics teachers at KCL</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F05608D-A8E8-4C1A-91A9-0D68BD9291B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>16th Feb 2015, training for PGCE trainees at KCL in 'Teaching with Latin Inscriptions' - 20 Trainee Teachers.

An enhanced appreciation among members of the public visiting the museum of the potential contribution of Latin inscriptions to understanding Roman culture and society
? Ashmolean Museum gallery displays now include an enriched contribution from Latin inscriptions - Randolph Gallery; Reading &amp;amp; Writing Gallery; Rome Gallery; Mediterranean Gallery
? More teachers incorporating use of Latin inscriptions into their teaching at both primary and secondary levels, and bringing classes to the museum. This is important in encouraging source-based approaches to ancient history, and in encouraging school pupils to engage in Latin language. 
? New resources available for schools to use on visits to the Museum: the Ashmolean did not previously offer support for Roman-themed visits. Ashmolean Education Dept able to offer new Roman-focused activities for schools bringing pupils to the museum
? One significant impact for the Ashmolean Marketing team, which we did not anticipate, is that professional photographs of our events are now available to the museum for marketing What's On? events for the future.
? Workshops for museum curators in May 2017: we anticipate that this will create the opportunity for the exchange of ideas among UK and European museum professionals about how best to engage the public with Latin inscriptions
?
