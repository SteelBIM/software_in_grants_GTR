Systems</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J00930X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Despite of the fact that electrical cars are under development and have the potential to provide alternatives for short distance light duty transport, the internal combustion engine will continue to be the main power unit in vehicles for several decades to come. Compared with extensive research on combustion and after-treatment systems, little work has been completed with respect to engine system control optimisation, leaving considerable room to improve fuel economy and lower emissions. Current engine calibration process relies on deriving static tabular relationships and the corresponding values between each calibrated engine operating point, with closed-loop feedback control to adjust the settings accordingly for air-fuel ratio control in real engine operation so as to meet the performance targets and emissions legislation. Such a widely adopted method, however, is not efficient in achieving the best fuel economy of the vehicle due to the constraints in the time duration and cost of engine-bed based calibration. Environmental conditions changes, the time required for the closed-loop control to respond, cycle-by-cycle variations, and cylinder-to-cylinder variations make the current engine control impossible to handle the the optimisation of the engine functionalities.
 
The development trend for future engines is towards an on-board intelligence for control and calibration and some research activities for the development of model based control systems are reported in literature. However, feasible strategies to control the engine operation cycle-by-cycle and cylinder-by-cylinder are not yet available. 

Expanding the work of the applicants in the related areas for many years, the overall Goal of this project is to use a combination of joint efforts from 3 research groups with expertise of engine technology, control technology and computing algorithm in order to develop and test a new engine control and calibration methodology with on-line intelligence built in. This overall goal will be achieved through realising the following objectives:

(1) To develop a full real-time multi-cylinder engine model for cylinder-resolved-control purpose
(2) To develop a novel engine control strategy involving optimization of control points and control point locations, and multi-objective evaluation of test cycle performance
(3) To develop dynamic multi-objective evolutionary algorithms for online engine control optimization
(4) To demonstrate the implementation of the engine control models initially on Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) dSPACE system and then further rapid prototyping on a test engine.
(5) To compare the engine performance using the new techniques with traditional calibration and control approaches, and demonstrate improvements in terms of engine output, fuel consumption, and emissions.
 
The new engine control methodology will be evaluated on a new Jaguar gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>While the control of the engine operation cycle-by-cycle with optimal calibration will be necessary but it is impossible without a new generation of engine management system. A successful conclusion to this project will lead to a new concept engine technology. This proposed project will combine the expertise of mechanical engineering, electrical/electronic engineering and computer science with the goal of developing the next generation of engine calibration and control strategy. It can be expected to have a significant impact on the current practice in the motor industry. It will take the R&amp;amp;D and application of new engine control technology in the UK to an international leading level and has great potential to make contributions to the reduction of global energy consumption and CO2 emissions and thus contribute to the environmental protection. A number of industry companies have shown a great interest in the proposed research and the impact of the project can be envisaged in the support letters supplied by the industry partners. 

This project will generate a considerable amount of knowledge to advance the methodologies in engine calibration and control. The new knowledge will be exploited and used by the industry in order to explore this technical path. The result of the project will be passed to industry in the most effective way and the OEMs involved are currently producing over 1 millions engines. Opportunities to reduce the time required for engine calibration and optimised control of engine operation will have a significant cost implication which would be cascaded to the OEM partners and all partners will benefit by passing the knowledge on to their practice in production. The implication of the research results, however, will not be limited to the products of the industrial partners and shall be available for exploitation by all members of the consortium within the agreed distribution of IP. 

Dissemination of outcome of the research will be through various arrangements: (1) The results will be reported in various publications, and presentations will be made through participating in national and international seminars and conferences in the UK/ Europe and the world including SAE World Congress in Detroit, and SAE Powertrain, Fuels and Lubricants Meetings, and IEEE conferences, as well as in international journals with professional organisations such as the IMechE, ASME and IEEE. (2) A userful forum for timely dissemation across the country's engine commnuminty will be UnICEG (University IC Engines Group), through which 3 seminars are organised to share research findings with scientists, reseachers, engineers, and PhD students. (3) Archives will be filed by academic theses, papers and, where appropriate, patent applications. (4) A publically accessible webpage will be created at the beginning of the project and updated regularly to report findings and progress. (5) Regular project meetings are to be mutually hosted by University and industrial partners to review the project progress and to discuss the challenges encountered and technical direction. (6) Progress at all stages will be written into reports which will be distributed to all partners. (7) The principal investigators will organize all the engagement activities in a timely manner. (8) The anticipated intellectual property rights (IPR) will be covered and protected by standard University/Industry practice. 

 A showcase will be created to demonstrate the merits of the project outcomes and to encourage industrial engagement from other motor companies and engine manufacturers. Also, the research fellows and the research students will work closely with the industrial partners and engage in their potential future products development. Development in this present research area can be expected to have a significant impact on the current movement to new engine calibration and control strategies in the motor industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>563195</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in meeting with AVL</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4DC1FE71-AF48-4716-8D76-D384E3B08E0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with professionals from AVL regarding the operation of 4-cylinder Puma Engine in acquiring controlling systems to operate the engine and testing emissions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.avl.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>It is proved that Computational Intelligence Non-model-based Calibration Approach (CINCA) has the potential to help engine calibration engineers improve calibration process remarkably.

The model-based calibration using Design of Experiments (DoE) is a common solution to engine calibration in the recent years. The idea behind it is to carry out calibration on a statistical engine model rather than a real internal combustion engine. This approach needs a great deal of experimental data to develop the statistical engine model, as well as experienced calibration engineers to design the corresponding experiments by DoE. It also appears that there is no great potential of this method for future development due to limitation of further measurement time reduction. Moreover, the increasingly high requirements of engine model accuracy and large number of variables also constrain the future of model-based engine calibration method. The purpose of this project is to reduce the time and efforts put into the calibration process for the optimization of an internal combustion engine by Computational Intelligence Non-model-based Calibration Approach (CINCA). Compared to the model-based calibration approach, the introduced CINCA bypasses the DoE-based test planning and statistical engine model development processes. Additionally, in the CINCA, the engine test bench measurements and optimization processes are combined into one process. In other words, compared to executing the calibration processes gradually, the CINCA operates these steps in parallel. In the proposed CINCA method, the fuel consumption and PM emissions are continuously measured throughout the engine test bench experiments. Meanwhile, the engine calibration variables, Intake Valves Opening (IVO) phase, Exhaust Valves Closing (EVC) phase, Spark timing (Spk_t), Injection timing (Inj_t) and Fuel Rail Pressure (Rail_P), are tuned correspondingly, based on the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA2). To implement the CINCA on a V6 GDI engine test bench, a Simulink based CINCA model was developed and applied on the real engine by Rapid Control Prototyping (RCP) and external ECU bypass technology. 
The key findings are: 
1. From the research so far, it is found that the evolutionary algorithm (EA) has a very strong potential to provide a complete solution package to improve the current engine calibration process, either offline or online. The researchers of the University of Birmingham have developed Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) based engine calibration optimizer. The researchers at the University of Birmingham for validating the engine optimization method have also developed a GDI engine model. From the co-simulation study and experimental validation results, it is found that the developed engine optimization approach is able to find the optimal engine parameter set, for the best fuel economy and minimum PM emissions, with a good accuracy and much higher speed. The researchers at the University of Birmingham have also commissioned a new V6 GDI engine test bed, for implementing and validating the novel developed engine optimization methods on a real engine. 
2. The developed Computational Intelligence Non-model-based Calibration Approach (CINCA) has the potential to help engine calibration engineers improve online calibration process remarkably. The CINCA was implemented on a V6 GDI engine test bench, the experiment results show that: 
a. The CINCA is capable of automatically finding the optimal engine variables set, which is very similar to the default ECU set, from blank after 50 generations searching (2.5 hours). It shows a more efficient and economical way to optimize the engine performance; 
b. The CINCA can even find the variables setting with better fuel consumptions (3.1% at the maximum) and PM emissions compared to the default ECU set; 
c. Compared to the conventional model-based engine calibration, the CINCA is able to predict the engine variables set for better engine performance generation-by-generation intelligently without using DoE and engine model. The conclusions above show that the developed CINCA has great potential to improve the automatic level for engine calibration. 
3. The application of a computational intelligence multi-objective calibration approach on a GDI engine model is introduced, and validated by co-simulation study. The Co-simulation result shows that: 
a. The optimization approach can lead the reference indicators to converge to the area of the best engine performance; 
b. For the GDI engine cases, there are up to 3.2%, 16.5% and 10.3% improvements over the given experimental data which can be achieved for ISFC, ISPMN and ISPMM respectively by the developed optimizer. It means that the optimizer is able to find better performance points based on the limited experimental data; 
c. More loops leads to better optimization results, but longer time the optimizer takes a longer time. And bigger population size can help to make finding the best results easier.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Due to the increasingly stringent emission regulations and the demand for automotive manufacturers on improvement of fuel economy, the complexity of modern engines is increasing. Moreover due to the combinatory explosion of the parameter space, the traditional manual engine calibration approach is thus becoming technically inadequate, economically expensive and time consuming. Vehicle manufacturers have to spend more money and time on the engine optimization process. The developed EA based engine optimization method is very promising to help the automotive industry saving money and time from tedious engine calibration work and control optimization. 

 2. The Computational Intelligence Non-model-based Calibration Approach (CINCA), which has the potential to help engine calibration engineers improve calibration process remarkably, can be put to use in vehicle industry for engine calibration and optimization. 

3. Two papers Application of Computational Intelligence Multi-objective Calibration on a GDI Engine Model&amp;quot; and Computational Intelligence Non-model-based Calibration Approach for Internal Combustion Engines based on the findings will be published. There will help to improve the intelligent control behaviors of the GDI engine. And the advanced control technology will be implemented into the engine based on the key findings.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8F2C0D3C-0242-4789-8338-F204D314B344</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>software licence was sold to FORD</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1C7DD2F9-8085-4536-AC83-E16587319D1B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The present work developed a new computational intelligence approach to calibrate internal combustion engine without the engine model.

Then a Co-simulation platform was established for the computational intelligence multi-objective calibration simulation in the given engine driving condition.</gtr:description><gtr:id>02BAF159-5415-4E93-8C63-EA607747FBD0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The co-simulation study and experimental validation results suggested that the developed intelligence calibration approach could find the optimal GDI engine actuators' settings with acceptable accuracy in much less time, compared to the traditional approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Computational Intelligence Multi-objective Calibration Algorithm</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3694949E-6F59-4D24-B220-FDBF34CFEDCF"><gtr:id>3694949E-6F59-4D24-B220-FDBF34CFEDCF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Investigation on the Self-Stabilization Feature of HCCI Combustion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c64e7820c2cac5febc19e6b9d4ccb3d0"><gtr:id>c64e7820c2cac5febc19e6b9d4ccb3d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ma H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9BC5D2F0-D7A3-46B3-A936-F8AA42D2FB8F"><gtr:id>9BC5D2F0-D7A3-46B3-A936-F8AA42D2FB8F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Study of Methodology for the Investigation of Engine Transient Performance</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/68b84fdc6b4a76fd1e2c7942a4d4779e"><gtr:id>68b84fdc6b4a76fd1e2c7942a4d4779e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tan C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A097B5EF-E933-40EC-BAEF-70E62407D908"><gtr:id>A097B5EF-E933-40EC-BAEF-70E62407D908</gtr:id><gtr:title>Multiple Model Predictive Control for Diesel Engines with Dual Loop Exhaust Gas Recirculation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d3797b917aac4af81f5f9b5412ebe0da"><gtr:id>d3797b917aac4af81f5f9b5412ebe0da</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lu G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/36B87FBA-0FCC-4DC9-B272-48F7718F7E6C"><gtr:id>36B87FBA-0FCC-4DC9-B272-48F7718F7E6C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Impact of fuel and injection system on particle emissions from a GDI engine</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Applied Energy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/55e9c812cfbba94f1e7e00b693cdb8e1"><gtr:id>55e9c812cfbba94f1e7e00b693cdb8e1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wang C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4299603C-F322-4B35-82ED-F37F547029C7"><gtr:id>4299603C-F322-4B35-82ED-F37F547029C7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthesis and tribological studies of nanoparticle additives for pyrolysis bio-oil formulated as a diesel fuel</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d0cd56c5d6f324ffe01776b7518642ba"><gtr:id>d0cd56c5d6f324ffe01776b7518642ba</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Xu Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/226F97FA-FCCE-4CD2-B2FD-9DD25D9EAE29"><gtr:id>226F97FA-FCCE-4CD2-B2FD-9DD25D9EAE29</gtr:id><gtr:title>Meta-Heuristic Algorithms in Car Engine Design: A Literature Survey</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b86b72aae5c7e279aa5a738d95f27944"><gtr:id>b86b72aae5c7e279aa5a738d95f27944</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Tayarani-N.
