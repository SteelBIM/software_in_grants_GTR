New strategies for managing urban flood risk are required, necessitating radical changes in the ways cities are managed, planned and developed. Previous research has identified multiple options and measures for future urban flood risk management that align with more general targets for water centric, sustainable communities. However, it remains unclear how these options and measures can be:

(1) delivered in practice, and; 
(2) comprehensively evaluated in terms of their benefits and costs. 

Recognising this, the project proposed here will develop novel ways of driving new, resilient urban forms and fabrics through delivering measures to manage flood events sustainably while enhancing urban life; providing scope for radical solutions under new build; and, realising possibilities for improving existing performance through retrofit and urban renewal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Pathways to Impact
Flooding adversely affects people, communities, businesses, insurers, governments and the environment nationally and internationally, and research that can help reduce the probability and/or consequences of flood has huge potential for impact. The fact is that the great majority of flood-related risks are associated with cities, because that is where the consequences of flooding are particularly severe.

Managing the risks of urban flooding to individuals, communities, businesses, property, infrastructure, commerce and the environment in cities, lies at the heart of this project. The project objectives include studies of the impact on, and feedback from stakeholders including not only FRM planners and decision-makers, but also individual citizens, community leaders, businesses, etc. In this respect, the pathways to impact are in fact an integral part of the project. For example, we note the following project objectives: 

&amp;quot;Put competent authorities, businesses and communities at the centre of the research by establishing feedback pathways between them and the FRM modellers, planners and decision makers to ensure co-production of knowledge.&amp;quot; and 
&amp;quot;Illustrate how this approach can be used to support learning from multiple feedback loops at every stage of FRM appraisal, decision making, implementation, evaluation and adaptation.&amp;quot; 

Research in the project will start by drawing on the procedures already adopted by practitioners in designing urban fabrics, spaces and green corridors including, amongst others, the SuDS Manual, the RRC Manual, FRA Channel Design Options and relevant CIRIA Reports. This means that the project's outputs will be set in a framework that is readily usable by practitioners. For example, CIRIA (Paul Shaffer) have agreed to organise a dissemination workshop for UK stakeholders andto publish a CIRIA Report based on our research outcomes. They will also serve on the Steering Panel which we will have in place when the project starts. In this context, we already have commitments from DEFRA, the Environment Agency, SEPA, Arup, CIRIA and UKWIR to serve on the Steering Panel. 

We will engage with professional associations such as the IWA internationally and CIRIA nationally. IWA already have a &amp;quot;Cities of the Future&amp;quot; initiative that we will interact with. We will present work at national and international conferences such as the biennial International Conference on Water Sensitive Urban Design. In the later stages of the project we will publish in appropriate, peer-reviewed international journals, such as the Journal of Flood Risk Management. Internationally, we will engage with other projects such as the Delft Flood Resilience Group (www. floodresiliencegroup.org) and the highly regarded, &amp;quot;Grey to Green&amp;quot; initiative in Portland, Oregon. The latter link has already been agreed in principle with Mike Reed (Chief Environmental Officer) of Portland City Council. We will communicate the research on an on-going basis through internet-base tools including a project website, twitter feed and LinkedIn group maintained by the Nottingham PDRA.

The Investigators all have prior experience of working with end-users in other projects. In particular Thorne and Wright have been involved in generating user-focused research outputs in FRMRC. In this context, Thorne was deputy Chair Dissemination) for the FRMRC and he chaired FRMRC's Dissemination Committee. Nottingham University were responsible for the two User-focused Deliverables produced during FRMRC 1 and were involved in producing 3 out of the 4 CIRIA Reports coming out of FRMRC 2. In this respect, the professional and stakeholder networks already developed under FRMRC will bring a large group of end-users to this project. 

Other co-investigators are involved in a number of other funded projects (EU, Research Councils, etc.) both in the UK and internationally that will ensure two-way engagement with this project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1434824</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This diagram illustrates the concept of a Blue-Green City and the comparison of the hydrologic (water cycle) and environmental (streetscape) attributes in conventional and Blue-Green Cities.

The aim was to develop a Blue-Green vision that includes flood risk and surface water management plus the delivery of multiple diverse ecological, socio-cultural and economic benefits for the City of Newcastle and the wider region. Emily Lawson (Blue-Green Cities team member) is the coordinator and organises meeting every 6-10 weeks, including booking rooms, writing the agenda, contacting speakers to present, recruiting members and keeping existing members interested in attending meetings. Other Blue-Green Cities team members regularly attend meetings and give updates on their research and share recent research findings with the Newcastle stakeholders. The Blue-Green Cities team have also taken suggestions from the LAA and included these in flood inundation simulations, co-producing knowledge on flood risk in Newcastle. The partnership will host a dissemination event in Feb 2016 to showcase Blue-Green Cities research outputs plus invite key stakeholders in Newcastle City Council, Northumbrian Water, Newcastle University, and the EA to sign up to a pledge for continued support and progression towards the Blue-Green vision.

A group of residents and professionals (practitioners, Environment Agency staff, local authority) worked through several modelling activities, culminating in the co-generation of a cause-effect conceptual model of flood risk in Netica. This focussed on nine catchment objectives (identified by participants), alongside their respective causes, drivers, and possible solutions (or 'interventions'). This model was then run through four different future socio-economic scenarios.

Work was supported by Calderdale Council and Environment Agency staff, amongst others, who attended the workshops, and disseminated the findings more widely within their respective organisations. The work has since been presented to DEFRA, the National Flood Forum, the EA Innovation Team (Leeds Office) and in academic institutions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bluegreencities.ac.uk/bluegreencities/documents/140228-bgc-factsheet.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newcastle 2016 dissemination event: presentation from Colin Thorne on The multiple benefits of living in a Blue-Green City</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D1D454AC-405E-415A-BA11-D0E50481E61F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk was given at the Blue-Green Cities end of project dissemination event in Feb 2016 (Improving Flood Resilience: the Blue-Green Advantage) by Prof Colin Thorne (University of Nottingham).

There have been five meetings to date, with between 20-45 participants at each, including ~5 members of the project team. The LAA meetings will continue throughout the lifetime of the project (Jan 2016) with the goal for Newcastle stakeholders to take ownership and continue the group after the project ends.

The meetings have allowed Newcastle stakeholders to bring their expertise, but talk freely outside of any organisational constraints in an atmosphere of mutual trust and ownership. We have facilitated open knowledge-sharing and discussions between stakeholders who may not typically get the opportunity to have frank discussions. The group is developing strategies for incorporating blue-green infrastructure into Newcastle master plans for urban regeneration, with a hope to influence policy and implementation.

Participants generally consisted of local residents, with a smaller number of representatives from partner agencies (Nottinghamshire County Council, EA, Severn Trent Water). Participants worked through a series of structured modelling activities, that culminated in the co-construction of a conceptual model of flood risk, based on the 2013 flooding events that affected Southwell, Nottinghamshire. The model borrowed elements from system dynamics to investigate how the risk to different receptors changed throughout the flooding event. This was achieved by identifying eight risk hotspots across the town, and discussing each of these in detail.

A model of urban flood inundation (pluvial+fluvial) that will; produce inundation predictions across a range of events of different frequencies and lengths, leading to a probability map for inundation in an urban area; track the movement of sediments from catchment surfaces through Blue-Green features; model the movement of water through Blue-Green features including blue and green roofs, retention ponds, permeable paving, green space, and bioswales; and investigate the probability of culvert blockage by debris and how this may influence urban flooding

Impact assessment of Blue-Green design on receiving watercourse sediment, water quality levels, and habitat biodiversity 

GIS Multiple Benefits Evaluation tool to quantify and value benefits from individual components of Blue-Green infrastructure installations within flood risk management (FRM) strategies 

A decision support tool for option of appraisal of appropriate Blue-Green Infrastructure and FRM strategies within a Blue-Green approach to integrated urban planning and urban renewal

A flood footprint analysis for economic impacts of floods at the city/regional scale, and a corresponding analysis to determine how the addition of Blue-Green infrastructure can reduce the flood risk and associated economic impacts of flooding

A framework to identify the uncertainties and barriers to widespread implementation of Blue-Green infrastructure, and strategies to overcome the barriers
