Account</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L02263X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The industrial adoption of graphene requires large area, high quality material. In order to produce the necessary material on substrates of choice, we wish to use our patented photo-thermal chemical vapour deposition (PT-CVD) system. PT-CVD uses a high intensity optical source to efficiently couple energy to grow high quality graphene on specially engineered catalyst substrates. 

In relation to this Strategic Equipment bid the principal equipment requested is a photo-thermal chemical vapour deposition (PT-CVD) system from Thermco-Tetreon Technology. The system comprises an in-situ catalyst deposition system (to avoid oxidation and contamination) and a dedicated growth chamber capable of growth on 100 mm sized substrates, a bespoke rapid optical growth stabilisation array, in-situ Raman monitoring, residual gas analysis system and an AFM with Kelvin probe. The photo-thermal energy for growth is delivered from the rapid-growth stabilisation array consisting of high power optical sources, which can provide temperatures in excess of 1000C at the reaction front, whilst the substrate remains below 450C, compatible with CMOS integration. For both process control and further development the PT-CVD system will have an ancillary atomic force microscope, capable of scanning over large areas at high frame rates and high resolution to provide fast, accurate metrology of the graphene product. Also included is an in-situ Raman mapping system and residual gas analysis which will provide unique insight into the science of catalytic graphene growth as well as for quality control. 

The principal PT-CVD graphene growth system, its rapid growth catalyst stabilisation unit, the ancillary quality control and in-situ growth monitoring equipment should be considered as a single unit system in order for us to develop this strategic material growth process for the establishment of electronic grade material for the UK and beyond.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This strategic equipment bid will allow for the key engineering challenges for large scale graphene production to be addressed and, in doing, so will allow for the exploitation in technologies not previously demonstrated due to the size limitations of high quality material. It is also a natural lead into extending the UK's Manufacturing the Future agenda. We have previously demonstrated how, from a fundamental understanding of the catalyst and energy coupling during the growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), it would be possible to produce CNTs at low effective substrate temperatures. The resultant spinout business, Surrey NanoSystems Ltd, has raised over &amp;pound;11m to commercialise carbon based technologies and here we use our knowledge and proven track-record in carbon nanomaterial growth and characterisation to develop a large area high quality graphene growth system. 

The impact of our research will be felt in UK manufacturing industry, allowing large area quality graphene to be produced for the first time on suitable substrates. We will produce high quality graphene for the benefit of the UK defence, advanced materials, space and communication industries. The University of Surrey is particularly strong in the area of mobile and wireless communications (via the 5GIC) and low cost space engineering though Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. We have been invited to become a member of the TSB's Catapult Innovation Centre in Satellite applications as well as the Connected Digital Economy catapult.

In the shorter term, several outcomes may have potential for commercial impact, and exploitation will be managed with the advice and aid of the Research and Enterprise Support (RES) office of the University. The Technology Transfer Office within RES is responsible for the protection and exploitation of intellectual property developed by staff, and has already acted upon a number of developments by the investigators in this proposal. The University of Surrey has a strong track recordfor commercial exploitation of research, with many successful spin out companies and wealth generation. The successful demonstration of large area high-quality graphene grown at low temperatures will have significant impact in the academic sphere and we expect high quality publications in major journals and conference presentations. Furthermore key outcomes will also be publicised through our institute's websites, via the graphene HUB and the University Communications and Marketing Services, in order to maximise the impact of the findings to both academic and industrial end users. 

Over the last decade, despite major advances in graphene science, the impact on a world scale from a product point of view has been quite limited. Novel approaches to deliver real engineering solutions are needed and we believe that the technology we develop will pull graphene from pure research toward manufacturing. This project will deliver important applied and fundamental knowledge to research communities in the areas of national importance highlighted by the EPSRC - specifically: Manufacturing for the future, High Frequency Device Engineering and Carbon Nanotechnologies.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2024-07-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3378171</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Technology, Malaysia</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Malaysia</gtr:country><gtr:description>Universiti Teknologi Malaysia</gtr:description><gtr:id>4820C6D7-7FD0-4A37-808D-A882656520CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too early.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>UTM providing materials for testing</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration between Prof John Varcoe and Professor Nasef from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia involves testing of UTM materials in Surrey's fuel cells and Raman Instrument.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Barcelona (UB)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>University of Barcelona</gtr:description><gtr:id>FF904E4D-6800-403A-882D-2E4E61547CBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too early</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The University of Barcelon modifies conducting fibres and tests those modified fibres.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The collaboration between Dr Carol Crean and Prof E Valles involves the University of Barcelona modifying conducting fibres made at Surrey with magnetic materials.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Physical Laboratory (NPL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research Engineer sponsorship</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D5C904F-260E-4E29-A089-E414DB843EE8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>too early in this cycle</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The nine organisations are sponsoring Research Engineers for the October 2016 start as part of the Engineering Doctorate programme with contributions exceeding &amp;pound;400k.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The equipment supports the Engineering Doctorate Research Engineers on the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Micro- and Nano Materials and Technologies (MiNMaT) programme and as such provides an attractive facility that future RE's are able to access.

Equipment enabled the purchase of four pieces of research equipment to support the Engineering Doctorate Research Engineers on the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) in Micro- and Nano Materials and Technologies (MiNMaT) programme. The equipment is available to all RE's as well as the wider University research community. As the EngD RE's are based with their sponsoring organisations throughout their studies, access to this equipment has a direct and tangible benefit to UK industry. The equipment is an enabling technology that strengthens the performance of other research conducted at Surrey. As such impact is implicit in these grants and Surrey's continued collaboration with industry and other research organisations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C2094246-DA05-4579-9DD8-85320AA5D855</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>The patent describes he newly discovered amorphous gyroidal states of matter and introduce a new technique to mimic one of nature's greatest achievements - natural structural colour.

Atomic Force Microscope (Bruker) - The AFM provides capability to undertake high resolution measurements of the surfaces of different materials. Such surface characteristics are important in many cases including work on adhesion, wetting and corrosion.
 
o Developing AFM techniques to study the microstructure of materials (Bacon): Surface topography and Volta potential mapping of beryllium samples using tapping mode and scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy (SKPFM) respectively. For the purpose of analysing second phase particles present at the surface of the metal, which are known to cause localised corrosion. 
o Heat Spreading in Components Incorporating CVD Diamond for Scientific Instruments (Stupple): AFM was used to produce high-resolution scans of the surfaces of Chemical Vapour Deposited diamond samples, allowing characterisation of microstructure. Different samples were shown to vary in their grain size, number of voids and degree of processing damage.
o In addition to the projects listed above RE's Richards, Durant, and Bull have also made use of the AFM as part of their projects to perform routine surface characterisation work as part of their projects. 

Digital Image Correlation (DIC) for Mechanical Testing (Enabling Process Technologies Ltd.) - DIC equipment forms an integral part of the University's mechanical testing facility. This has had direct input on EngD projects as well as broader work supporting RCUK projects as well as a range of PG and UG student projects. 

o Can damage to armour be assessed in the field in order to minimise time spent out of use? (Matthews): Project in relies on DIC as part of investigation to understanding whether the use of DIC is a viable means of damage detection for armoured helmets. The equipment has been used as a way to develop different modes of coupon excitation for surface strain. In the future, the equipment will be used for understanding whether the technique has the potential to detect damage prior to ballistic property degradation.
o Improving the properties of wire and arc additively manufactured parts for reproducibility (Ryan): DIC is used during tensile testing of samples from Wire Arc Additive Manufactured (WAAM) parts to understand the effect that wire feed speed and travel speed had on the mechanical properties.
o Advanced composite assemblies for aerospace applications (Dighton): DIC has been used to obtain a full-field strain map for an experimental test element designed to be representative of an adhesively bonded composite to composite structural joint in a wingbox. The data generated will be correlated with data obtained from strain gauge measurements, and mechanical test data, to validate a computational model of the structure. The VIC 3D software will also be used to scrutinise areas of interest where the test element is believed to have failed in order to build up a bigger picture on failure modes. 
o Carbon fibre based compression moulding compounds in automotive applications (Kite): The use DIC on compression moulding compounds allows the full field strain on the surface to be visualised, helping identify how the material is failing and identifying multiple areas of strain concentration. As well as visualising the full field strain, DIC is used with this material to provide a lower cost-per-test than the correct use of strain gauges.
o Use of plasma pre-treatment in adhesive bonding (Williams): Work has contributed towards supporting this EngD project by exploring the capabilities of DIC to measure strain field in adhesive joints. This is an example of DIC being used to interrogate small areas in a non-contact manner thereby preventing the generated strains from being affected by the measurement method. 

UV/Ozone Cleaners for Electron Microscopy Samples (Hitachi) - The UV/Ozone cleaners are attached to the high resolution SEM available to all RE's. As such it forms a core facility for a large number of RE's using our microscopes. Of the heavier users the outlines below provide examples of how the facility is supporting our RE's:

o Developing AFM techniques to study the microstructure of materials (Bacon): Removing hydrocarbon contamination from metallic samples prior to subsequent SEM and AES analysis.
o Improving the properties of wire and arc additively manufactured parts for reproducibility (Ryan): Ozone cleaner is used to clean wire samples in order to remove hydrocarbon contamination from the surface before performing XPS on the samples. The system has also been used to remove carbon contamination from Bakelite samples before performing SEM on the samples.

Nanoparticle Size Analyser (Malvern Instruments) - Nanoparticle size provides a route to determine particle size distributions in a range of systems including the investigation of ceramic, metallic and polymeric materials as well as a range of organic/biological species. 

o Characterisation of metal-on-metal hip implant wear debris in clinical hips (Minta): Nano-PSA has been used for the measurement of gold nanoparticles to be used as part of the monitoring technique being developed within the project.
o The facilities are also used on the Nanomaterials and Ceramics technical short courses available to the RE's. Here students study the rheological properties of suspended particles and determine ink stability and nanoparticle stability. Nanomaterials is a compulsory taught module taken by all RE's which ceramics is one of the elective modules. As such this facility is used by all of our RE's.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is to early to know what will prove the most significant outcome. Currently, there are two areas being pursued through industrial collaborations, and disclosure of results is necessarily limited. We can report usefully increased lithium storage capacity for battery electrodes coated with particular types of PTCVD-grown carbon nanotubes.

For the Research Engineers equipment project, the facilities represent an enabling technology that impacts multiple grants across Surrey's research portfolio. The facilities will continue to be made available to the EngD RE's and research community in the future, so will continue to impact that research.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DE20AC4C-2E11-4768-AA85-6CE1F7DEB717</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Construction,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D6F4F491-4411-4D58-ACC1-3A820E87CC1C"><gtr:id>D6F4F491-4411-4D58-ACC1-3A820E87CC1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>An optimised synthesis of high performance radiation-grafted anion-exchange membranes</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Green Chem.</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c4fb28c7b7f759ed5da54d4f587d639a"><gtr:id>c4fb28c7b7f759ed5da54d4f587d639a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wang L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9D2DCBE0-F74A-41B3-BAC1-1C46E684065F"><gtr:id>9D2DCBE0-F74A-41B3-BAC1-1C46E684065F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Coherent quantum transport features in carbon superlattice structures.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scientific reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0bb428dcf75820c978f4eccb0b49341a"><gtr:id>0bb428dcf75820c978f4eccb0b49341a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McIntosh R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2045-2322</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/920E2FA6-CDE8-4AE5-B33B-8B7D8B3EF77C"><gtr:id>920E2FA6-CDE8-4AE5-B33B-8B7D8B3EF77C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Graphene 'moth eyes' to power future smart technologies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>SPIE Newsroom</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9dc58dd9929e05eec3a6c8a1cdfe959e"><gtr:id>9dc58dd9929e05eec3a6c8a1cdfe959e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Anguita J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/27E1642D-517A-43CA-88D5-9CC10DDAA4F9"><gtr:id>27E1642D-517A-43CA-88D5-9CC10DDAA4F9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Carbon Nanotube Interconnects Realized through Functionalization and Sintered Silver Attachment.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/21aff227bf2809dea571404dc29689ed"><gtr:id>21aff227bf2809dea571404dc29689ed</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gopee V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1944-8244</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/81C275FD-E5A3-45D8-B1D9-B54564312EFA"><gtr:id>81C275FD-E5A3-45D8-B1D9-B54564312EFA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Local self-uniformity in photonic networks.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature communications</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5340b682f91a9fd8f79b306111b7f96f"><gtr:id>5340b682f91a9fd8f79b306111b7f96f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sellers SR</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2041-1723</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5D9C0F6B-0B7F-4C9C-83AC-A053A58307C3"><gtr:id>5D9C0F6B-0B7F-4C9C-83AC-A053A58307C3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Unfolding the band structure of GaAsBi.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
