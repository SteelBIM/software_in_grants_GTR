Green and Water Structures in Bangladesh and Tanzania</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/L001616/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Bangladesh and Tanzania are two rapidly urbanising least-developed countries facing the prospect of poverty becoming an 'urban problem' well before 2050. Their growing urban populations living in low-income settlements rely for many fundamental services on two important ecosystems: urban green and water structures. These provide shelter, fuel, food, protection from extreme weather, access to safe drinking water, drainage, and flood and pollution prevention; however, they are also the source of 'disservices', such as harmful bacteria, which can lead to chronic ill-health.

In these low-income countries where state authority is weak, co-production (providing public services through collaboration between state agencies and citizen groups) and community collective action can together serve as building blocks for institutional effectiveness. Co-production requires consensus, which collective action can provide: their combination is thus a potentially rewarding - though little researched - approach to ensuring better access to ecosystem services for the urban poor.
 
Our research intends to identify policy-relevant design principles and operational practices for the institutional arrangements needed to produce ecosystem services which promote sustainable improvements in the wellbeing of the urban poor. We focus on services derived, and disservices resulting, from urban green and water structures in low-income settlements in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). The similarities between these two cities will enable findings to be generalised, while their contrasts will allow us to develop a robust conceptual framework and test emerging hypotheses.
 
This project addresses three main questions:
1) What access and exposure do the urban poor have to green and water ecosystem services and risks?
2) What institutional arrangements structure that access at different scales?
3) Do co-production and collective action improve the urban poor's access to ecosystem services and create a basis for developing effective institutions?

We bring three main theoretical considerations to the study: urban ecosystems; the political ecology of urban change; and institutional diversity. The research is structured into four interconnected work packages: WP1 - Assessment of ecosystem services and disservices; WP2 - Mediating institutional structures; WP3 - Progressive institutional arrangements; and WP4 - Comparative analysis and impact dissemination.

Qualitative and quantitative data will feed into a comparative analysis and synthesis of findings which will provide rigorous new evidence on the institutional challenges facing associations of poor urban people, state and non-state agencies, and the knowledge community in their efforts to sustain and improve ecosystem processes and maintain and expand urban poor people's access to fundamental services across the city space. This knowledge will assist policy making and programme design by agencies in Bangladesh, Tanzania and beyond, and the urban poverty-ecosystem link will be introduced into the global policy arena at a time when post-MDGs negotiations are gathering pace. Project deliverables will include a book, top-level academic papers, policy and press briefings, dissemination seminars in Dhaka, Dar es Salaam, Manchester and London, international conference presentations, and active engagement with informal policy processes.
 
This research builds on two successful major projects, ClimUrb and CLUVA, placing it in a strong position to deliver policy-relevant evidence to targeted audiences. It adopts a multi-disciplinary, multi-context approach, bringing together a team of leading Bangladeshi, Tanzanian and UK researchers, and it will train and engage 20 promising young Bangladeshi and Tanzanian researchers. Through the implementation of a carefully developed impact strategy, the project will ensure that its benefits reach both academic and development beneficiaries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The ultimate beneficiaries of our research are poor urban residents in Bangladesh and Tanzania. This includes the current poor urban population and the tens of millions who will move to urban areas in the next few decades. We will co-produce knowledge about how their wellbeing strategies are linked to accessing services from urban green and water ecosystems, and the ways in which policies and institutions support or hinder such strategies. 

We intend this to open up the political space for the ideas and preferences of the urban poor, encouraging them to form, participate in and consolidate collective action. Our involvement with grassroots organisations such as Nagar Daridra Basteebashir Unnayan Sangstha (NDBUS) in Dhaka and Shack/Slum Dwellers International in Dar es Salaam will be an important component of our impact strategy. The process of co-producing knowledge through interactions between scientists and community-based experts will create a 'dialectic platform' for poor people's expertise to inform the knowledge community. This will put research into use not least by empowering our community-based experts as agents for change.
 
We are also targeting the professions in Bangladesh and Tanzania. Through our activities with trainee researchers at partner universities and the involvement of think-tank and NGO case workers/municipal community officers, civil servants and members of civil society, we will raise awareness among professionals of the need to optimise poor people's access to ecosystem services, minimise potential disservices and engage with urban residents.

We will also target policy-making elites at three levels:
- At the local level we will engage with municipal civil servants and politicians during our research and invite their participation in local workshops and policy dialogues. 
- Nationally, we will engage at ministerial and advisory levels through our final dissemination conferences, media coverage, and communication of academic and policy findings. 
- Internationally, the dissemination of our findings through a book, high-level papers, conference presentations, BBC World Service broadcasts, press articles, website and social media will seek to influence the country strategies of international agencies in Bangladesh and Tanzania and in turn help shape the debate on sustainability and urban poverty.

In order to ensure the practical relevance of our proposed project, and to commence engagement with key policymakers, we have already undertaken the following activities with key beneficiaries:
- participatory data collection and analysis methods in both cities; 
- feedback sessions at our case study sites; 
- city dialogues with academics and policy makers, civil society organisations and representatives of low-income communities; 
- and two half-day meetings with Bangladeshi researchers (Dhaka, February 2013) and African researchers (Manchester, March 2013).

We were able to do these activities thanks to our two existing (and successful) major projects - ClimUrb and CLUVA. ESPA will build directly on these research partnerships and policy uptake relationships. Our proposal is thus already strongly influenced by key beneficiary groups and target audiences. In addition, we will promote South-South collaboration through Bangladesh-Tanzania visits of experts with specialised knowledge.
Finally, we will train 20 promising young Bangladeshi and Tanzanian researchers in our project methodology and engage them to undertake data collection. We will support them on academic writing (directly and through our post-docs) and on working as part of a multidisciplinary team. We will extend our capacity-strengthening support to the organisations providing in-kind support to us.

Abstract: IPCC AR5 confirms urban climate change risks are often acute for those who live in informal settlements and in hazardous areas such as low-lying flood-prone areas. While scholarship on urban flooding is growing, research as well as policy has to date concerned itself little about urban poor's 'hidden/shadow spaces of suffering', and their 'full social cost'. Existing studies tend to focus on the actual spatial extend of the flood and concerns people that are affected within. Stories of those are displaced involuntarily, short/longer term, are at best collected partially from those who still live in or near the affected area. Studies that try to track those who are displaced are rare. We simply don't know how far people to cope or to acquiescence, who they get support from, how long do they stay there/with them and what the cumulative direct and indirect social cost of such displacement. This represents a major gap in our understanding of the true impacts of urban flood on poor urban people. The seed-corn project aims to develop an interdisciplinary methodology to map this hidden/shadow space of flood suffering and to estimate the social cost of urban flooding in Africa's growing informal settlements. The specific objectives are: (a) understanding the causes and consequences of flooding; (b) capturing the full extent of people's displacement because of flooding; and (c) contributing to better flood forecast, preparation and (mitigation/adaptive) action. Pilot studies will be undertaken in selected slums in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (taking the advantage of two on-going projects, namely EcoPoor; and The Last 100 Metres).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Holloway, University of London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Network for Sustainable Cities and Urbanisation in India</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D6FB72E-E07D-4C82-858B-7A5818EAD9B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaborating team has submitted a grant proposal.

A brief outline of the two projects is noted below:

Since 2013, as part of our ESPA funded EcoPoor programme, we have been conducting research to identify policy-relevant design principles and operational practices for the institutional arrangements needed to produce ecosystem services which promote sustainable improvements in the wellbeing of the urban poor. Our focus has been on services derived, and disservices resulting, from the urban environment in low-income settlements in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). Very recently (December 2016), the British Academy (UK) has awarded us another important project to build on the key findings of the EcoPoor project. This new project, which we are calling The Last 100 Metres (L100M), will examine how to transform infrastructure and practice to prevent the contamination of drinking water by sewage in the informal settlements of Dar-es-Salaam and Dhaka. 

The Dialogue was held on 21st February 2017 and was structured as below:
9:00 Arrival and coffee
9:30-11:00 EcoPoor key findings
- Welcome from Ardhi University
- EcoPoor programme' main question 
- Ecosystem services and disservices 
- Ecopoor's main message
- Q&amp;amp;A
11:00-11:30 Coffee
11:30-12:45 Introducing the 'Last 100Metres' project
- Objectives
- What we want to do and how
- Community &amp;amp; stakeholder involvement: which began by asking the participating community members to talk about their views, followed by a facilitated discussion on 3-4 key questions- this was translated in Swahili.

The workshop was a day-long event hosted by Ardhi University - EcoPoor project's lead institution in Tanzania. 15 members of the Bangladesh, Tanzania and UK teams attended the workshop (see Annex 1 in the proceedings). There were four sessions covering the four main tasks of the EcoPoor project: contextualising the EcoPoor project in Dar; methodology; selection of case study settlements; and forward planning. The sessions started with thematic presentations, followed by moderated discussions around a set of core questions (see Annex 2 for Workshop Programme). The presentations can be downloaded from the EcoPoor website. The rest of the report presents a detailed account of the discussion that took place in the four sessions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ecopoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Proceedings-of-EcoPoor-Research-Framework-Dar-es-Salaam-Workshop.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contamination of Drinking Water by Sewage in the Informal Settlements: An International Dialogue on Dhaka</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>56EA70C5-BAEC-4BB4-A6FB-71CEE591F654</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The above International Dialogue was arranged so that a team of inter-disciplinary scholars may reaffirm our EcoPoor project's key findings, whilst also discuss our approach for the Last 100 Metres (L100M) project, which builds on the EcoPoor findings. A brief outline of the two projects is noted below: 

Since 2013, as part of our ESPA funded EcoPoor programme, we have been conducting research to identify policy-relevant design principles and operational practices for the institutional arrangements needed to produce ecosystem services which promote sustainable improvements in the wellbeing of the urban poor. Our focus has been on services derived, and disservices resulting, from the urban environment in low-income settlements in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and Dar es Salaam (Tanzania). Very recently (December 2016), the British Academy (UK) has awarded us another important project to build on the key findings of the EcoPoor project. This new project, which we are calling The Last 100 Metres (L100M), will examine how to transform infrastructure and practice to prevent the contamination of drinking water by sewage in the informal settlements of Dar-es-Salaam and Dhaka. 

The Dialogue was held on 7th January 2017 and was structured as below: 

9:30 am arrival &amp;amp; coffee for 10am start
10:00-10:15 Welcome from Khiarul Islam (Country Representative, WaterAid Bangladesh). 
10:15-11:00 Project Backdrop (Manoj Roy &amp;amp; James Rothwell) (including Q&amp;amp;A)
11:00-11:45 What we want/need to do - methodology and approach (including Q&amp;amp;A)
11:45-12:30 Rapid selection of a short list of candidate settlements (involving agreement on indicators)
12:30-1:15 LUNCH
1:15 - 2:15 Group work: three groups: (1) settlement mapping, GIS/GPS capture, and social survey; (2) environmental monitoring; and (3) action research protocol. Further details will be discussed and agreed upon at the start of the session. The groups will have to present their work on both Dhaka (detailed) and Dar versions (draft).
2:15-2:30 Coffee
2:30-3:30 Group work presentation
3:30-4:15 Sketching out the business plan
4:15-4:30 Plan for 8th and 9th Jan (rapid visits to candidate settlements - may be in two groups)

Our data collection is completion and analysis has begun. This workshop has been arranged so that a team of inter-disciplinary scholars may validate and reaffirm EcoPoor emerging findings. 

The workshop included the following programme:
?Day 1 (18th Jan): Workshop on 'Understanding EcoPoor Data' in which our UK/Bangladesh/Tanzania research leads will present the synthesized data.
?Day 2 (19th Jan): Workshop on 'EcoPoor Key Findings' where our research leads will present the key findings based on the synthesized data presented in Day 1. 
?Day 3 (20th Jan): Workshop on 'Dhaka-Dar Comparison' in which invited experts will chair and facilitate discussions to compare/contrast Dhaka and Dar on key EcoPoor research themes. The closing session will discuss the 'major academic papers' emerging from the study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>The rise of private slum developers in Bangladesh and India: heroes or villains?</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-02-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The British Academy</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>PM140171</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>6422EEB8-9127-4C4C-8903-2D0307E8F50F</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Sinking Citizens:A Study of Africa's Flood-displaced Urban Poor</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Lancaster University</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EAA7469</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BD359A2A-4AFE-43A2-81D9-D9B45E7E1EA4</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>359991</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>'The Last 100 Metres': Safeguarding Potable Water Provisioning to Urban Informal Settlements</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Academy</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>GF160000</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>947256E7-F229-4BF9-BE20-BD9A5A98959B</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-12-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Why We Do Not Have Data on the Physical Environment in African and Asian Cities</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FBFA2F18-66B9-4F31-A54B-BE6199E20277</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article has been reported (page 28) of ESPA Directorate Annual Report 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.espa.ac.uk/files/espa/ESPA_2014-15_Annual_Report_Final_0.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Research Networks in South Asia: Analysing International Research Collaborations in Afganistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and SriLanka</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B294BC71-0494-4DA9-9B1C-C49007B15146</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://sydney.edu.au/global-health/news-events/2015/British-Council-report-final-2014-May.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EcoPoor Key Findings -
