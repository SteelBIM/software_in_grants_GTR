Goldsmiths hosted an online screening of her documentary film and a webchat with the director in May 2013. Lee's documentary film 'The Price of Death' received the Richard Werbner Prize for Visual Ethnography at the Royal Anthropological Institute's International Festival of Ethnographic Film (June 2013). The film was screened in South Africa, at the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University, in May 2013. The film was the main feature at a community event in Khayelitsha township, Cape Town, in May 2013 and members of the local community were invited to attend. The screening was organised alongside a panel discussion which included a local pastor, the programme director of a local HIV/AIDS advocacy organisation (Yabonga), and two African undertakers. The film generated heated debate and discussion between members of the public and the undertakers, largely around how best to manage the unscrupulous practices of some township funeral parlours, which were seen as taking advantage of widespread mortality and increased consumerism. Both audience members and panellists agreed that the film deserved further community screenings, as the issue of the spiralling cost of funerals is a pressing concern for most township residents.
The film has been shown to NGOs such as Educo Africa and The Warehouse, and will become part of their outreach activities, in particular to augment staff training and facilitation around issues such as grief and loss. The co-founder of the US-based organisation The School of Lost Borders, has brought a copy of the film back with her to the United States to increase awareness of the South African context of death and dying, and as preparation for the organisation's workshops and courses on death and the dying process</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Documentary: Price of Death</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/62117549</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Swaziland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Swaziland, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Ongoing research collaboration Vaughan and Kalusa</gtr:description><gtr:id>19B2B0A2-A127-4D6E-8004-70285A85350A</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Research collaboration began when Dr Walima Kalusa was employed by the AHRC project as a post-doctoral research fellow.

This paper examines the evidence for a recent increase in suicide rates in East and Southern Africa. In examines in detail the different discourses on suicide employed in Kenya, Uganda, Botswana and South Africa. It argues that, with the possible exception of South Africa, there are no reliable statistics through which to evaluate the claim that suicide rates are increasing. In the South African case, the 'discovery' of black suicide is linked closely to anxieties about rates of violence in the country; in countries of East Africa, suicide is more likely to be interpreted in terms of 'social breakdown' and anomie. The paper then goes on to report on the results of fieldwork in Malawi which attempted to uncover attitudes towards suicide in the present. There is very little qualitative research on suicide in this part of Africa. This paper makes an original contribution and points the way to further research. This research has been discussed with and disseminated amongst practicing mental health professionals in Eastern and Southern Africa. There is very little qualitative social research on suicide in Africa, and even less that has any historical perspective. This work sheds light on the ways in which suicide is understood socially and culturally. and how it connects to belief systems. It also examines critically the recent assertions that the regions are experiencing a dramatic rise in the incidence of suicide. These findings are understood to be important, though it is probably too soon to demonstrate that they have had a direct impact on professionals and policy-makers.

2. This AHRC-funded international conference on Death in African History was hosted by the University of Cambridge and Goldsmiths, University of London. The conference brought together scholars from a number of disciplines (history, social anthropology, archaeology, cultural studies and politics) to advance the study of death in Africa. Participants included representatives of NGOs working with communities dealing with HIV/AIDS in South Africa, as well as academics from African universities. 
The conference confirmed the need for an interdisciplinary approach and a grounded historical account of death practices and understanding of death in Africa. Feedback from participants was very positive indeed, and we look forward to a continued conversation with them. We are pleased to report that a selection of conference papers was published in a Special Issue of the Journal of African History, vol. 49 (2008). Dr Lee and Prof Vaughan organised this international conference which brought together academics working in the field of 'death studies' with representatives working on the 'front-line' of death and its management in African society, including the health care sector, NGOs and religious organisations. These organisations included the African Mental Health Foundation (Kenya), the Samaritans (Kenya), Muizenberg Community Church (RSA), Muslim Information Centre and Masakhane Muslim Community (RSA), Redeemed Christian Church of God (Nigeria), Red Cross Children's Hospital (RSA), Children's Institute (RSA), Children's HIV/AIDS Network and the Western Cape Networking AIDS Community of South Africa, EDUCO Africa (RSA).
This engagement between academia and civil society fostered a meaningful mutual exchange of ideas on how Africans understand and cope with the dying process. Both conferences also provided a useful historical perspective on the current AIDS crisis by seeking to situate the AIDS epidemic in a much longer history of African responses to death and dying. Dr Lee and Prof Vaughan have sustained relationships with some of the colleagues invited, and these relationships have been mutually beneficial. Dr Lee, for example, has given feedback to Lali Mili, of Educo Africa, on Educo's 'Living and Dying Workshop' (a programme which supports the personal development of caregivers and sufferers of terminal illness and HIV/AIDS). Dr Lee gathered in-depth interviews of former participants of the Living and Dying workshop, which could be used to improve its provision and reach.

Our work shows that much of the current research on the impact of HIV/AIDS needs to be set within a broader and more historical context. 
An 'epidemiological turn' in discussions of road safety, influenced by HIV/AIDS discourses, tends to obscure African accounts of road deaths which may emphasise the importance of infrastructural legacies (of colonialism and apartheid) and psycho-social constructions of road danger. 
The social and political meanings of suicide are changing, and suicide is understood very differently in different parts of Eastern and Southern Africa. The role of psychological discourses is important in this regard, as are inquisitorial regimes, but suicide often remains imbued with spiritual meanings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project research is relevant to a number of non-academic contexts, particularly in Africa.
