The Leverhulme funded project provided confirmation that a developmental model of writing is appropriate to conceptualise the writing skills of children who are struggling with writing. Significant progress has been made in specifying the components of a developmental model of writing from this research. The next step is to engage professionals who work directly with children in educational contexts with the research. The impact strategy that is planned consists of the following three parts:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Partner Workshops with teachers and education professionals&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Research based Briefings and a one day conference&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Enhanced Web Resources with Research Based Materials.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The aim of each of these three parts is to encourage knowledge transfer through the development of evidence-based practice in education related to the teaching of writing.&lt;/p>

The workshops were designed to follow and build on a successful project investigating the writing profiles of children with specific language impairment (SLI) funded by the Leverhulme Trust. This project was notable for the use of digital writing tablets to collect data on writing development thus opening up a whole new understanding of how language and spelling problems inhibit the fluent production of written text. 
We ran a series of partner workshops with school and Local Authority (LA) staff reflecting on and developing practice, developing teaching materials and other resources and enhancing their own research capacity.

Partners were very positive about the workshops and commented on how they had made an impact on their practice. One teacher wrote how the research evidence discussed had &amp;quot;made me consider more closely which teaching approaches would have the biggest impact on progress. As a result I have used peer assessment and peer editing within lessons.&amp;quot; Teacher feedback indicated that the workshop experience contributed positively to their work in influencing colleagues to take an evidence based approach to teaching writing. One teacher, for example, trialed teaching typing skills to lower achieving children in their school and assessed the number of words they could type at the beginning of the year and the end of the year to see if the intervention had any impact. Another school, using the writing package, implemented Clicker 6 software to support pupils with SEN and stated this helped many children make accelerated progress. Therefore, we can be confident that the workshops have had a strong impact at the regional level.
Follow up work with partners has led to a series of further collaborations. This includes further training sessions on the CBM for specialist teachers, giving talks at schools and other education related meetings and conferences, producing professionally related articles, organizing further conferences and giving keynote presentations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Struggling to Write.

There has been immediate regional impact with evidence-based changes to practice reported by advisory teachers in the region, evidence of wider national impact through the reports of our conference attendees and growing international impact through increasing visitors to our website, requests for information and international dissemination. The involvement of our partners in the project has built a strong partnership that is now continually raising questions for both research and practice.

 In sum the project has served to enhance the capacity of UK educators to use evidence-based approaches to the teaching of writing and the reach of the project continues.Thus, this project has underlined the urgent need for us to continue to challenge current conceptualisations of the writing process in classroom contexts, further encourage use of the developmental model of writing and to continue to provide practitioners with the needed skills to support their practice. Key issues prioritised by the teachers were writing in the transition between primary and secondary schooling, reliable and rapid assessment of progress in writing, spelling and handwriting and children with writing difficulties.

Three series of partner workshops with regional partners taking part in each workshop (Partners were teachers, LA professionals, SEN teachers and advisors across 5 LA's). The focus of these sessions was knowledge exchange between the researchers and partners. We used partnership principles for the workshop series. Partners brought ideas, expertise and knowledge about teaching writing in the classroom and the challenges and barriers they faced in supporting effective teaching of writing. The researchers contributed their knowledge of reliable and valid assessments and effective interventions for writing, conceptual tools (such as our developmental framework of writing) and physical tools (such as our digital writing tablets and curriculum based measurement protocol). We were careful to design the workshops to integrate with the practitioners' cultural and organisational environment. Partnering generated the capacity to reflect, inform and integrate practice and research on both sides. The activities developed by the research team supported partners in reflecting on their practice, using evidence-based knowledge and tools in their teaching and the production of a variety of materials that could inform their practice in the teaching of writing more widely. The researchers used the sessions to enhance and refine their assessment and intervention materials to ensure they were valid in classroom contexts and for teachers with varying levels of expertise. 

2) Curriculum Based Measures of Writing Tool

Assessment was a key concern of our partners and so we actively tested and further developed our CBM measure of writing. We received feedback on the efficacy of the measure and all the teachers used it in their practice and with their colleagues in schools/LAs. In partnership we produced a teacher friendly manual on CBM for dissemination at the plenary conference. 

3) Survey of writing packages in schools

A comprehensive survey of writing packages in common use in schools in England was also produced with our partner's full contribution (ROS). This useful tool provides teachers with a single document illustrating the range of the many writing packages available to teachers. The review demonstrated the lack of research evidence underpinning the packages.

4) Web pages to disseminate materials

We also disseminated, reviewed and produced research based materials on the teaching of writing in the workshops, at the plenary conference and on our website (http://psych.brookes.ac.uk/ewsc/) Some of these were reviews published from the USA and were not known in the UK. Our own publications and presentations from the conferences and workshops are on the website available for download. The partner workshops involved staff from 19 primary schools, including headteachers, special LA advisory teachers, inclusion advisors and PCT staff. Workshop evaluation indicated that as a direct result of the workshops the majority of partners (77%) had instigated evidence-based practices in their approach to the teaching of writing and that all indicated ways they intended to use such approaches in the near future. In particular all the advisory teachers reported that they have shared it across other staff in the LA. All classroom teachers took the opportunity to use CBM methods in their own teaching through evaluating their own classes and discussing the results in the workshops. Eighty Eight per cent of workshop partners stated they had immediate plans to continue to use CBM in their practice.

Teacher feedback indicated that the conceptual tools, assessment tools, research reviews and writing packages survey developed in the project all contributed positively to the partners work in influencing colleagues to take an evidence based approach to the development of writing in children.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>37A1F98C-9D93-4BCE-8AD4-01228AB7EE96</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://psych.brookes.ac.uk/ewsc/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Impact on Regional Teaching of Writing in Primary and Secondary Schools in UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BDBEABDA-2746-4328-AB10-68EBFA945405</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through a series of workshops and conferences, researchers, teachers and education professionals collaborated to examine barriers to effective writing in children, translate research-based tools into classroom practice and exchange information about evidence informed approaches to assessment and intervention. This resulted in the growth of the teachers' capacity to identify and address profiles of writing performance and the researchers' awareness of the resources and materials required in practice. Materials were developed and distributed nationally and internationally. There was immediate regional impact with evidence-based changes to practice reported by advisory teachers in the region, evidence of wider national impact through training and conference presentations and growing international impact through increasing visitors to our website, requests for information and international training and dissemination. 
The relationships with our partners have been enhanced by ongoing dialogue. Our evidence based CBM tool is actively being used by teachers. This project has helped refine this tool and identify strengths and limitations in its use. We have also trained other researchers internationally to use it in their practice. Issues raised during knowledge exchange activities have contributed to our publications and the potential for designing a viable writing intervention project. Demand from teachers and advisors for further engagement led to funding being secured to present more events for a wider nationally based audience. Our scientific impact has increased our UK and international research collaborations. Our societal impact has served to enhance the capacity of UK educators to use evidence-based approaches to the teaching of writing, provided a useable model of how the writing process breaks down and how practitioners might monitor writing progress in the classroom more efficiently.
