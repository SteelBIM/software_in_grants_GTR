Indeed, some of the oldest geometric objects considered by mathematicians, Platonic solids and more general polytopes, are inherently combinatorial in nature. An important feature is that polytopes can be constructed by gluing lower-dimensional, and hence simpler, polytopes.This idea of describing a complicated object by gluing simpler pieces is ubiquitous in modern mathematics. Topological spaces equipped with a triangulation or a more general kind of cell decomposition, sheaves, and localisation results in algebra may serve as examples. The main idea is that the properties of the global object are entirely determined by the properties of the building blocks, and that one can pass from (known) local properties to (unknown) global properties by virtue of sophisticated gluing arguments.Around the mid-70s, algebraic geometers developed the theory of toric varieties, providing a formalism for describing algebraic varieties by rather simple-looking combinatorial objects (collections of cones in a finite-dimensional real vector space). This is in fact another example of the method described before to obtain interesting and complicated global objects by gluing well-understood simple small pieces, and has the added benefit that the abstract gluing process is readily visualised by gluing cones along common faces. A modification of the construction led to the notion of toric manifolds developed by Davis and Januskiewicz, initiating a new branch in topology nowadays known as toric topology . Both the algebraic and the topological side are active research areas today, and provide deep links between such diverse subjects as convex geometry, algebraic geometry, algebra, topology, polytope theory and combinatorics.The proposed research is about the less obvious relation between toric methods and homotopy theory. The connection works both ways. One can use toric methods to attack finiteness issues in algebra, topology and combinatorics. Going the other way, modern homotopy theory provides the means to give new descriptions of objects from toric geometry, or to extend the scope of toric geometry into new and exciting contexts, eg, algebraic geometry over the sphere spectrum , or over the field with one element .</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research is on the borderline of various areas of pure mathematics, and brings together aspects of topology, geometry, algebra and combinatorics. Beneficiaries are, in the first instance, mathematicians working in any of these areas. The results of my research will be presented at international conferences and colloquia in the UK and abroad, and will be published in peer reviewed journals of international standing. Thus the research will reach a broad academic audience in the UK and worldwide. As is the case with all research in pure mathematics, this project is about generating knowledge. Economic impact is indirect and will be achieved largely by two means: firstly, by enhancing the reputation of Queen's University Belfast as a research-active environment, and hence enhancing the reputation of the UK as a leading research nation; secondly, by the influence of research on student education via research led teaching , thus contributing to high quality teaching at Queen's University Belfast.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>101318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>[IGC] On Novikov cohomology of cochain complexes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5F4B4E7D-6511-4563-A20E-C91B48E492D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A conference talk on the Irish Geometry Conference, NUI Maynooth, 20-21 June 2013.

This is demonstrated in my research on finite domination of chain complexes in which David Quinn and myself use a toric geometry motivated approach to obtain new results (and, as a bonus, new proofs for known results) in homological algebra. Specifically we found new characterisations of finite domination in terms of the vanishing of finitely many Novikov homologies. This improves previously known results which incorporate infinitely many vanishing conditions. These results are of interest also in topology and geometric group theory, where related construction have been studied.

In another strand of the research project I considered the algebraic K-theory of graded rings, and of projective toric varieties. The toric methods yield very general splitting results in the latter case, and new computations of graded K-theory of certain graded rings.

In another direction I used a toric approach to analyse how sheaves of modules can be glued up to homotopy equivalence, resulting in a generalisation of Quillen's K-theory computation of projective spaces to other types of varieties, and to non-commutative ground rings.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research results have been published in peer reviewed journals, and communicated to a wide audience in several presentations in the US, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Taiwan, China, South Korea and UK. My research has connections with algebraic topology and geometric group theory which I hope to investigate in more depth in the future. In collaboration with David Quinn I have developed new tools in homological algebra which are available, through publications, preprints and conference presentations, to all researchers in this subject.

The methods developed in the research project led to a PhD project, in which methods are transferred and applied to the theory of graded rings and modules. This opens up an entirely new line of investigations of a more algebraic nature.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E2E54B8B-DDD1-48FD-988C-A6F366738A63</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CCC37A2E-614E-4857-AA32-5ADDEE60B475"><gtr:id>CCC37A2E-614E-4857-AA32-5ADDEE60B475</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Note on the GradedK-Theory of Certain Graded Rings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Communications in Algebra</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6fd687e56f303ffd0a7f2fb4aa22e6ce"><gtr:id>6fd687e56f303ffd0a7f2fb4aa22e6ce</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>H?ttemann T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5E0C0775-4904-4BFB-8C29-F90EDA3ADF75"><gtr:id>5E0C0775-4904-4BFB-8C29-F90EDA3ADF75</gtr:id><gtr:title>Double complexes and vanishing of Novikov cohomology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Serdica Mathematical Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/89930524c8abc7c50ac4967bca72cb91"><gtr:id>89930524c8abc7c50ac4967bca72cb91</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thomas Huettemann (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6ADFFD16-9B19-4FA2-A762-A5AEE0E7186F"><gtr:id>6ADFFD16-9B19-4FA2-A762-A5AEE0E7186F</gtr:id><gtr:title>FINITE DOMINATION AND NOVIKOV RINGS.
