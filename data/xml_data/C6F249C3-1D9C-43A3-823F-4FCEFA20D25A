Many major hospitals and clinical research centres in the Europe, the US and Asia are now commissioning cyclotrons and developing PET research facilities locally. Fluorine-18 is an important isotope for PET. It has a relatively long half-life (109 mins) and is readily generated in a cyclotron in the form of [18F]-fluoride ion, in very high specificic activity (GBq's) from oxygen-18 water. As a consequence new methods to develop C-[18F]F bond formation for PET labelling are in demand, In general the link between fluorine chemistry and pharmaceutical/medical applications is strong. Approximately 20% of all pharmaceutical, since the 1950s, contain a fluorine atom and the bio-distribution of all new pharmaceutical products are required to be explored by PET, as part of clinical trials. Also new PET tracers are in demand as tools for early diagnosis as indicators of disease states. New fluorine chemistry is required to meet the demands of a growing and dynamic PET research community both in the UK and internationally. This proposal aims to develop a novel methodology for incorporating fluoride-18 into relevant orgaganic molecules.
In this proposal we aim to exploit a novel enzyme which can form C-F bonds from fluoride ion. The fluorinase enzyme was discovered in 2002 (Nature, 2002, 416, 279) in St Andrews and it has been over-expressed and its structure (X-ray) and mechanism elucidated. The enzyme catalyses the reaction of fluoride ion and S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to generate 5'-FDA and L-methionine. It has proven to be a chemoselective biotransformation method for generating C-18F bonds from inorganic [18F]-fluoride. The fluorinase is the only example of an enzyme used in PET synthesis and in this regard it offers an entirely new method for incorporating fluorine. In practical terms it has emerged to be particularly appropriate, because PET uses picomolar [18F]-fluoride ion, but the over-expressed fluorinase enzyme is present at mg/ml (microM), and therefore the kinetics favour C-18F synthesis due to a large molar excess of enzyme. 
This is a research collaboration between the Universities of St Andrews and Aberdeen where the methods will be developed in St Andrews and the radiolabeling protocols carried out at the Aberdeen PET Centre, situated in the Royal Infirmary Hospital. The major focus of the research will concentrate on developing fluorinase based chemistry to prepare novel fluorine-18 small molecules that can be used to attach to proteins through site specific cysteine residues. It is a current objective to find novel methods to radiolabel proteins such as enzymes and antibodies, to monitor their in vivo distribution by imaging. A key strategy will explore substrate analogues for the fluorinase, which carry acetylene residues, such that a 'click' chemistry approach can be adopted.
A secondary objective of the research is to exploit an efficient chemo-enzymatic synthesis of [18F]-fluoroacetyl-CoA, developed between St Andrews and Aberdeen, to prepare [18F]-fluorocitrate, [18F]-fluoromalate and [18F]-N-aceylglutamate, as novelties for in vivo imaging. 

In overview the research will present a range of new methodologies for PET chemistry for the incorporation of the fluorine-18 isotope into molecules of biological relevance. The research in generic and aims to expemplify new methods, for much wider applications by the growing international research community of PET radiochemists.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
The research will develop enzymatic C-18F bond formation for PET. In particular it will develop a range of novel 18F-labelled molecules with potential as new imaging agents eg for cancer. It will also introduce a novel methodology for radiolabelling proteins in a site specific manner, for particular proteins used to diagnose particular disease states, by PET imaging. The fluorinase has the potential to be utilised by a variety of PET Centres and radio-chemists involved in protein labelling for imaging. These chemists work in PET radiochemistry labs closely associated with the pharmaceuticals industries or directly in clinical research environments. So the research has the potential to impact quickly and directly on translational medicine research environments. Outstanding success, perhaps in 10 years time would see fluorinase methods being used internationally to prepare a specific compound or for labelling a specific protein, that will impact on disease diagnosis and contribute to improving health treatment. In that respect members of the public will benefit.

How will they benefit?
The programme will demonstrate the potential and range of the fluorinase methodology and creative scientists will be able to apply it in other arenas to solve their particular diagnostic challenge. Eg to make a specifically labelled molecule, or label a protein using fluorinase technology applied to a particular disease. 

What will be done?
The outcomes of the research will be published in leading journals, following a pattern from our recent research projects. The methodology and how to apply it will be available quickly to the international community. Patenting and IPR protection will be required for societal impact. This is already in place, but can be developed for individual applications, eg specific protein lebelling. Such IPR will most reasonably be pursued at the individual research project level, as developments unfold. The important aspect of this programme is to demonstrate the scope of the methodology to the international community and demonstrate the potential that may lie in fluorinase biocatalysis applied to PET.

Methods of Communication and engagement
The research will be published. Presentations will be made at key international conferences both in fluorine/pharma chemistry environments and among the radiochemistry/PET Imaging community, following a current pattern by DO'H/MZ. Specific targeting of the imaging community will be pursued. 
The PI and CoI are on the Executive Committee of SINAPSE (Scottish Imaging Network, a Platform for Excellence). ( http://www.sinapse.ac.uk/ )
They have access to major meetings and congregations of the International Clinical Imaging Community, through that mechanism. The SINAPSE connection enables an ongoing and intensive discussion with the relevant international community. SINAPSE are keen to project their successes and provide an excellent additional vehicle for dissemination.

Collaboration and exploitation
St Andrews has a full patent on the fluorinase (2002). There is a sound platform on which to exploit any new technology. The fluorinase also has BBSRC Follow on Funding (till Nov 2011) to develop the fluorinase as a user friendly catalyst for [18F]-fluorodeoxyribose ([18F]-FDR) synthesis. Through this and SINAPSE we have a close relationship with GSK at the Hammersmith Hospital in London. Key GSK scientists advise on potential applications of the research in clinical imaging perspective. Through such routes the impact of the research will reach front line translational medical laboratories working in the relevant area.
