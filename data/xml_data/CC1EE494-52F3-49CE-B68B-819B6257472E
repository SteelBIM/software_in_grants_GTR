In the UK, wheat is sown on over 1.8 million hectares with a production value of ~&amp;pound;1.7 billion. Although significant increases in yield have been achieved during the last half century, the current and future demands for wheat and other cereals will require accelerated increases in productivity. This emerges as a grand challenge for society as we seek to produce enough food for a growing global population (with changing dietary preferences) in a sustainable manner. 

Take-all disease, caused by the soil fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), is the most damaging root disease of wheat worldwide. The introduction of genes for take-all resistance into cultivated wheat has been identified as a top priority by the UK plant breeding industry and by HGCA on behalf of arable farmers (see accompanying letters from a consortium of UK plant breeders and from HGCA). At least half of UK wheat crops are affected by the disease, with average yield losses of 5-20% and complete failure under severe take-all conditions. Conservative estimates of the cost of take-all associated yield losses in the UK range from &amp;pound;85 m to &amp;pound;340 m per annum. Disease severity increases with successive wheat cropping, therefore growth of second and third wheat crops in the same fields can become commercially unviable. This problem will be exacerbated as the need for food production increases and cropping systems becomes even more intensive. Thus take-all disease represents a major threat to UK and world food security and there is an urgent need for simple, economic and sustainable strategies for disease control. Current control methods rely on crop rotation, biological control and fungicides, none of which are effective in preventing the yield losses indicated above. 

The most effective way to achieve simple, economic and sustainable control of take-all disease is through genetic resistance. Resistance to t-all would represent a step-change in wheat productivity, ensuring food security and enhanced industry competitiveness. It would also expand the ability to grow wheat in successive cropping seasons and increase its geographic distribution, and reduce chemical and fertiliser inputs. Unfortunately, there is no known major varietal resistance to take-all in cultivated wheat lines and hence the disease has so far proved to be intractable to breeders. In contrast, oats have extreme resistance to take-all and produce an antimicrobial triterpene glycoside (avenacin A-1) that provides protection against the disease. Wheat and other cereals do not make avenacin A-1 or appear to make other triterpene glycosides. We have cloned and characterised most of the genes for avenacin synthesis from oat. These genes are currently the only characterized source of genetic resistance to take-all from any cereal or grass species. Oat is too far removed from wheat to allow introduction of the genes for avenacin synthesis through conventional crossing or alien introgression, making genetic transformation the only viable option for introduction of these genes into wheat. The aim of this proposal is to engineer wheat to produce a suite of protective triterpenes that confer resistance to take-all disease. To do this we have assembled a customised toolkit for triterpene metabolic engineering using characterised genes and enzymes from oat and from dicot plant species.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Take-all disease has a substantial impact on wheat yield throughout the cereal-growing areas of the world and is a major threat to food security. The cost of this fungal disease to wheat production in the UK is estimated at &amp;pound;85-340m per annum. Take-all is a ubiquitous and chronic problem that that imposes serious limitations on wheat production as roughly half of UK wheat crops are affected. Introduction of genes through conventional breeding strategies relies on the identification of resistances through screening, and subsequent crossing into elite varieties, and is the approach taken in the wheat pre-breeding LoLa (BB/J004596/1). Our proposal takes a complementary approach that involves the direct introduction of cloned genes for take-all resistance into wheat through genetic modification (GM) which has the potential for more rapid delivery of useful genes into elite wheat varieties. 

We have assembled a customised toolkit for triterpene metabolic engineering in plants consisting of characterised genes and enzymes from oat and other plant species. Our aim is to engineer single and multiple steps for triterpene synthesis into hexaploid wheat and evaluate the consequences of this for triterpene production, plant performance and take-all resistance. The development of methods for high-efficiency transformation of wheat with multiple genes within this proposal will lay the foundation for introduction of other valuable multi-gene traits/processes (e.g. nitrogen fixation, C4 photosynthesis, polygenic pest/pathogen resistance, seed micronutrient content) into wheat in the future. 

The key deliverables and outcomes of this research programme will be: 
1. Evaluation of a transgenic approach to engineer wheat for the synthesis of protective triterpenes;
2. Establish a multi-gene wheat transformation platform; 
3. Provide industry with a potential solution to take-all disease;
4. Training of project scientists in cross-disciplinary and applied crop research</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The most important impact of this research will be the evaluation of a metabolic engineering strategy for control of take-all disease of wheat. This has the potential to provide the plant breeding industry with a strategy for disease control that will complement longer-term strategies currently being initiated within the wheat pre-breeding LoLa. There are many environmental and economic costs associated with take-all that have a detrimental effect on the overall competitiveness and sustainability of the UK arable industry. Introduction of take-all resistance into cultivated wheat will have a profound impact on reducing these negative externalities across the production sector.

We expect there to be a number of different beneficiaries of the proposed work. These will include the private sector in the form of wheat farmers and breeding companies, the UK environment, policy makers, and the wider public in general. Many of the expected benefits will be shared between groups and we have outlined some of these below:

- Increased yields: At least half of UK wheat crops are affected by take-all, with average yield losses between 5-20% and complete failure of the crop under severe take-all conditions. The average UK wheat production value is ~&amp;pound;1.7 b. Therefore the minimum cost of take-all to the UK arable industry is between &amp;pound;85m - 340m per annum. The availability of take-all resistant wheat would significantly reduce this loss and provide increased flexibility to farmers.
- Testing the potential of GM approaches: This work will test the potential of a GM approach to take-all control. The multi-gene wheat transformation platform established within this programme will provide cutting-edge enabling technology for academic researchers and industry for future wheat improvement for disease resistance and other important traits/processes (e.g. nitrogen fixation). 
- More efficient use of nitrogen fertilization: Take-all disease leads to reduced uptake of nitrogen by the roo. Not only is this inefficient and costly but the remaining nitrogen leaches into farmland water courses, so contributing to pollution and eutrophication. Improving resistance to take-all would therefore have both direct financial benefits (reduced nitrogen requirements of second and third wheat crops) and indirect consequences of improving nitrate utilisation, reducing wastage and increasing overall competitiveness of UK wheat growers.
- More efficient land use: Improved take-all resistance will result in increased yields in second and third wheat situations, enabling more wheat to be produced from the same amount of land. This will help in the sustainable intensification of UK agriculture, increasing the efficiency of land use and providing farmers with enhanced flexibility in their farm management practices.
- Training the next generation of crop scientists: This proposal brings together a unique combination of disciplines that will provide an exciting training ground for the project scientists involved. The resulting innovation and training will provide the next generation of skilled crop scientist, with benefits beyond the plant breeding industry, and boosting the UK economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>806167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Nicotiana benthamiana, a relative of the tobacco plant, is commonly used in plant research.

Led by Jenni Rant from the SAW Trust, Michael Stephenson, Colette Matthewman, Marc Jones and Dorota Jakubczyk (JIC) worked with Paolo Bombelli, Katrin Geisler (Cambridge University), Brenda Parker (UCL) and Marin Sawa (Imperial) to deliver a 3-day OpenPlant exhibit entitled &amp;quot;The Power of Plants&amp;quot; in the wildlife, weird science and adventure area at the Latitude Festival, Suffolk, from 14-17 July 2016. The exhibit showcased the potential applications of synthetic biology in plants in a hands-on and accessible way. The first day was dedicated to hosting organised school groups where children spent 40 minutes with us experimenting with a variety of plants to learn how scientists are using them in new and novel ways. The second and third day were run as a drop-in style to cater for family groups giving opportunities to engage with children and adults. Visitors were very interested to see science research straight from the labs and amazed by new innovations being developed through synthetic biology. The event was very tiring but the opportunity to work as a team with members from different institutes on a shared science theme was very enjoyable and rewarding whilst also expanding our understanding of each others work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.latitudefestival.com/stage/wildlife-weird-science-adventure</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NIAB Open day Science morning (2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>409882C8-6D4D-4C61-89AB-70E02AD19FB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstration of crop transformation.

Human evolution is tightly linked to our use of plants for food, building materials, fuel, medicines etc., and we continue to look for innovative ways to use natural resources to provide us with sustainable solutions that support our lifestyles. Scientific research is enabling us to discover and develop new plant products that improve our lifestyles by creating better medicines, healthier foods and greener technologies whilst also demonstrating the importance of protecting plant species diversity and ecosystems. 
The Nature's Factories stand was designed to enable the public to find out how science is exploring and exploiting the valuable variety of chemicals made by plants as well as making natural remedies to take away and pick leaves from our fact-tree.

We took the stand to the Science in Norwich Day at the Forum in Norwich (1st June 2014), to the Cambridge Botanic Gardens (19th August 2014) and on the 12th November 2014 used the stand for a training workshop for EU scientists to learn how to create interactive displays for public events. On 14-16 November 2014, our exhibit headed to Museum Gardens, Bethnal Green, London to be showcased at BBSRC's Great British Bioscience Festival. The festival, delivered in partnership with London Science Festival was open to the general public and free to attend.
Since then the exhibit has featured at the Bury St Edmunds family science festival (21st March 2015), the Fascination of Plants day at the John Innes Centre (14th May 2015), the Festival of Plants at Cambridge Botanic Gardens (16th May 2015) and at the Youth Stem Awards (13th January 2016).

In 1865, Mendel presented his work from studies done on pea plants in the gardens of the monastery in Brno that provided the first description of the Laws of Inheritance.

To celebrate Mendel's work and enable children to follow his methods to understand how the Laws of Inheritance work, we ran an interactive stand in the Discovery Zone at the Royal Norfolk Show. The stand provided a mix of hands-on science led by scientists from the John Innes Centre and an art activity that invited children to contribute to the build of some giant pea pods led by environmental artist Ruth MacDougall.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Demonstration on GM for Sainsbury produce managers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>731FBAF3-B8FA-4DA8-80B2-910C4DFB11AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstration of crop transformation.

The image library has the potential to attract new traffic to the NRP institute websites and research group homepages and will allow groups such as the media, schools, the general public and other researchers to gain a glimpse of the great depth and diversity of research that is being carried out in Norwich. Although all the images are freely available to download and use, people are required to sign up to use the library and are asked to enter information at the time of download about their intended use of the image. This helps to capture who is using the library and where the images are being used. So far images have been downloaded 582 times and have been used in presentations, publications, on websites, for education and advertising. We ran an image competition to raise awareness across the NRP site and then assembled a judging panel to select the top 12 images which were used to create an NRP calendar for 2016. The calendar was sent to politicians, business leaders, industry and academics at institutions in the UK and internationally. The competition featured in the local paper, the Eastern Daily Press and an overall winner was picked and used to make a large canvas which is hanging in the new Centrum building. We have received many positive comments about the libraries ease of use for finding good quality, copyright free images to use in presentations from fellow researchers across the site. In October 2016 we put on a two-week, large scale image exhibition at the Forum in Norwich as part of the first Norwich Science Festival. The images attracted a lot of interest and several artists have been in touch with scientists whose research images were on display to set up new collaborations using science to inform artistic practice. We will post outcomes of these endeavours onto the image library website to widen our exposure to new audiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://images.norwichresearchpark.ac.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Submitted scientific images to the Norwich Research Park image library</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2A0D93F-02B9-4EDE-B8A3-B9471623AE84</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The NRP image library consists of images arising from research in life and environmental sciences on the Norwich Research Park .

The interactive 'Power of Plants' stand from the Latitude Festival made another appearance at the first Norwich Science Festival with Katrin Geisler coming over from Cambridge University to join JIC scientists Michael Stephenson, Hannah Griffiths, Colette Matthewman, Zhenhua Liu, Nadiatul Radzman, Dorota Jakubczyk, Don Nguyen, Miriam Walden, Jenni Rant and Roger Castells-Graells for two days as part of the Norwich Research Park's 'solving problems with science' weekend. A new addition to the stand was developed by Roger who introduced visitors to the structure of viruses through his challenge to build a giant virus particle. Plants are being used to produce virus particles for use as vaccines and so for visitors this deeper look at viruses in combination with a hands-on experience of mock infiltration of Nicotiana benthamiana plants with water enabled the scientists to explain the techniques involved and exactly what is being made by plants in this system. People were very interested in the variety of science on display and asked lots of questions. It was good to showcase our research at the first Norwich Science Festival and to show people locally how far reaching the work taking place in essentially a rural county can be in terms of impact to societies across the globe.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://norwichsciencefestival.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk with GM  materials on Crop Transformation for NIAB Regional staff event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>81F52ED0-BC9F-4C00-82C9-EA86FCF140C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Demonstration of crop transformation.

A promoter set enabling co-ordinate cell type specific expression of genes in root meristem cells has been shown to function across both monocot and dicot species and so has considerable value for plant engineering for production of metabolites and for other traits such as nitrogen fixation. Importantly we have shown that these promoters are active in wheat. These promoters have been made available to academic groups and industry around the world for use in a variety of crop and model plant species. The demonstration of assembly of an 11-step triterpene pathway in tobacco using transient expression opens up opportunities for advanced triterpene engineering for the production of high value compounds for medical, agricultural and industrial biotechnology applications.

Introduction of single and multiple genes for triterpene synthesis into wheat is ongoing through our collaborators at the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in Cambridge. We have successfully generated transgenic wheat lines producing triterpene scaffolds, so providing the foundation for building more complex antimicrobial triterpenes similar to those produced by oat. 

An engagement activity has been carried out in a local school on the theme of genetic strategies for control of take-all disease in wheat (Barford Primary School, March 11th 2014). This activity was a Science, Art and Writing (SAW) project (www.sawtrust.org). The project is being written up for publication as a case study. The conversations with the children (who were age 9-10) on this GM-based project were quite profound and are highlighted below:

Child 1; &amp;quot; why can't you use bees to move DNA from one plant to another - so like the DNA from oat to wheat&amp;quot;?

Scientist; &amp;quot; well, bees do pollinate flowers and transfer DNA that way but only between species of plants that can be bred. Oat and wheat cannot be bred like that so we have to use other ways to put oat DNA into wheat&amp;quot;

Child 2; &amp;quot;but what if the bees can move the DNA but you don't want them to? Then all plants will have the DNA that scientists have introduced?..&amp;quot;

Scientist; &amp;quot;We can make the plants sterile so that they cannot pass on their DNA into new seeds, this is one way to control what we do&amp;quot;

Child 2; &amp;quot; But then the farmers can't collect seeds to plant the next year? I don't think the farmers would want to keep buying seeds!&amp;quot;

Scientist; &amp;quot; Yes, but actually it is better to buy seeds that almost guarantee you will have healthy plants to sell that to lose crops to disease and have nothing to sell&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>B0473AD4-7952-470E-BC2B-6044A53E1D2A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>A toolkit for terpene engineering of plants for food, health and industrial biotechnology applications has been established. Rapid methods for making multi-gene constructs have been developed and a number of these constructs have been validated both through transient expression in plant leaves and through generation of stably transformed lines of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We have also contributed to the development and publication of an article proposing a common syntax for plant synthetic biology that will enable interchangeability of parts. 

Introduction of single and multiple genes for triterpene synthesis into wheat is underway in collaboration with the National Institute of Agricultural Botany in Cambridge. Wheat lines engineered to produce triterpene scaffolds have been generated and the scaffold molecules detected in extracts of transgenic wheat by metabolite analysis. Lines that have been engineered to both produce and modify these scaffolds have been generated and are currently being characterised. Wheat lines transformed with three genes required for the synthesis and addition of an acyl group to the triterpene scaffold (a step that is important for antimicrobial activity) have been generated and shown to make the expected product.

Enzymes for two missing steps for the biosynthesis of the antimicrobial avenacin triterpene have been elucidated and the entire 11-step pathway has been expressed in tobacco by transient plant expression. The avenacin end-product was detected, demonstrating the feasibility of complete pathway assembly in a heterologous plant species. 

A promoter set from an oat metabolic gene cluster has been generated and tested in both monocot and dicot species. Importantly within this project we have shown that these root-expressed promoters from oat retain their characteristic expression pattern (in the outer cell layer of the root tips) when introduced into wheat. This discovery has considerable potential value for plant engineering for production of metabolites and for other traits such as nitrogen fixation, since sets of co-regulated promoters for driving the expression of multiple genes in plants are in short supply. 

An engagement activity has been carried out in a local school on the theme of genetic strategies for control of take-all disease in wheat. The postdoctoral researcher on this grant also secured funding from the OpenPlant fund for a small-scale project on engineering liverwort for the production of high value triterpenes with collaborators at the University of Cambridge.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The root-expressed promoter set that we have generated has been made available to academic groups and industry around the world for use in crop and model plant species.
