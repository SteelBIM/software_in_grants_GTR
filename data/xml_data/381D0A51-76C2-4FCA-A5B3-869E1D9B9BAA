exchange, this project examines the challenges and opportunities for sustaining designs and products of ethno-cultural
significance through the creation of urban ecologies of creative practice in major Chinese cities. It will result in a joint
authored report that includes: Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice: A framework for understanding the current condition
and future potential, socially and economically, of culturally significant designs, products and practices in Chinese cities.
This will be of interest to those in government and business sectors related primarily to The Creative Industries, with strong
associated links to the themes of Humanities Contributing to Development and Urban Transformations. The project will
develop a common understanding that recognises:

a. different qualities and stages of sustainment of culturally significant designs, products and practices in China and the UK;
b. related rural-urban contexts, between the two countries and
c. from the above, investigate commonalities, differences and opportunities for mutual learning and research development
in relation to culturally significant designs, products and practices - leading to a framework defining key characteristics,
strengths, weaknesses, benefits and obstacles, and future potential and opportunities for culturally significant designs and
products within Urban Ecologies of Creative Practice in Chinese cities.

While there are more and more re-examinations of the quality of Chinese cities after their rapid expansions in recent years,
this urban development can lead to a transition from hard power (politics, law) to soft power (culture, economy). The rich
ethnic cultures in China, especially those migrating from rural areas into cities, are set to reshape the soft power, which has
the potential to promote the sustainable development of cities and ethnic cultures. This research aims at how to understand
and carry forward ethnic cultures in the transformation of Chinese cities through studying creative designs, products and
services.

This research will be conducted in China and the UK. The project includes 6 visits - 3 by China researchers to the UK in
Autumn 2016, 2017, 2018 and 3 by UK researchers to China in Spring 2016, 2017 and 2018. Each will include site
visits and workshops. The latter two (one in UK, one in China) include extended workshops to develop the framework and
the final workshop includes Creative Industries representatives from the private sector and government.

These visits will each result in a Summary Report and contribution to a joint website Gallery and Blog Series. In addition,
joint summary reports will be produced documenting the emergent understandings of the relevance and role of the internet
and digital space in the future directions of culturally significant designs, products and practices. Emerging understandings,
insights and conclusions will inform the creation and successive refinements of the Framework. A summary report and
Gallery contributions will document the outcomes and insights drawn from the International Studios with students.

The final project report will provide an overview of the project, the finalised framework, as well as project outcomes,
conclusions, and identification for future joint research themes and opportunities.

ODA Compliance: Ethno-Cultural products and practices have a strong relationship to the notions of 'good work' and
employment thus to economic development and growth. This research will contribute to education and knowledge
development, among researchers, the students, and private sector and government participants. Wider dissemination of
findings through various publications will inform future research directions related to the creative industries, humanities
contributing to development and urban transformations.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impacts are: 1) Establishing foundations for research between China/UK in culturally significant designs &amp;amp; products in
China's Urban Creative Ecologies &amp;amp; the relation to ethno-cultural-economic development; 2) Developing collaborative
research projects; 3) Outcomes orientated to economic development and policy to enhance relevance to economic
development; 4) Dissemination: publications to academia &amp;amp; professions, a website.

These impacts concern knowledge-exchange, -building and -dissemination among Chinese &amp;amp; British academics from
various fields, including:

- Design: creativity, sustainability, strategies;
- Ethnology &amp;amp; Anthropology: ethno-cultural significance, heritage;
- Economic Development: ethnic economic &amp;amp; cultural policy;
- Urban Development &amp;amp; Social Research: urban &amp;amp; industrial anthropology;
- Ethnic Culture: identity, languages &amp;amp; arts history;
- Input by Private Sector &amp;amp; Government will allow research findings to be oriented to economic &amp;amp; urban development (re:
creative ecologies);
- Creative Industries: longer term impacts will: a) inform urban planners/developers of environments supportive of creative
industries; b) urban policy makers aiming to encourage economic development through Creative Ecologies; c) enhancing
understandings (policy, enterprise) of benefits &amp;amp; deficits of Urban Creative Ecologies; d) revealing how environmental
factors serve to a) support creative industries; b) inform policy makers; and c) contribute to an ethos of innovation &amp;amp;
creativity, some outcomes of which may be scalable.

The research will allow: Ethnology &amp;amp; Anthropology Academics in China to learn from experiences in UK in sector of
culturally significant design &amp;amp; products, brands, heritage and development of strategies at the local, regional and national
scales, to promote and develop these aspects of heritage in China in a period of rapid urbanization; Design Academics in
UK to learn from experiences &amp;amp; knowledge in China and their ecologies of creative practices, which offer excellent
examples of research underway by UK team; and Urban Planners &amp;amp; Developers to appreciate the benefits and potential of
heritage and facilitating ethno-cultural creative industries through support of creative ecologies of practice. Also, Creative
Industries, designer-maker enterprises in particular, will benefit in the longer term from this research as it forms a
foundation for development of condusive ecologies of practice with common facilities, synergistic opportunities.

The shorter term impacts will be manifested through collaborative conference papers [e.g. European Academy of Design,
IUAES (International Union of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences), Inter-Congress, Croatia, 2016; IUAES World
Congress, Brazil, 2018 ], journal papers (e.g. Design Journal; Journal of Chinese Literatures &amp;amp; Culture), and chapters (the
UK team will be publishing Design Routes, 2017 related to current AHRC research in Culturally Significant Designs and
Products and, through this collaboration, findings can be included.

In the longer term, activities centre around each country's culturally significant products and their viable future, especially
via ecologies of practice, providing a rich basis for project developments that bring together ethno-cultural factors and the
value of culturally significant designs &amp;amp; products, with design research in sustainability, design futures and development of
a framework for future viability. Also in the latter stages, the findings will be collaboratively presented to relevant private
sector parties in China to build links to business and to invite input and involvement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>59493</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Unmaking Waste Exhibition, SASA Gallery, University of South Australia, Adelaide

Each class participant was asked to get to know the city of Lancaster and its environs, especially its creative heritage and current creative activities, using the Creative Ecologies diagnostic tool developed and provided by the research team. Based on the evaluations and conclusions emerging from the Creative Ecologies Mapping, and the Introduction to Design Strategies, each group was asked to consider which strategies are the most appropriate for Lancaster; refer also to the Revitalisation Strategies document provided. As a group, and based on their creative ecologies' evaluation of Lancaster, used this document to decide on which revitalisation strategies to use. As a result of this module the research team was able to see the opportunity to improve the Creative Ecologies diagnostic tool to better serve in a workshop format with a group of participants elsewhere in the future.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - RMIT, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Design for Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7FFD5E1-D413-471D-9AC1-4F63D65EA7B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Talk: Design for Sustainability, RMIT, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 26 May 2015.

Specifically it: i) describes how Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) has been recognised, protected and supported in Shanghai, ii) presents examples of how ICH is preserved today and promoted to future generations, and iii) develops an understanding of how ICH can inform the conceptualisation of a creative ecology for Shanghai that visualises the existing condition, and, eventually, a 'design ecology' that shows constructive possibilities for design intervention. In particular, the research identifies a number of characteristics of ICH in Shanghai, including the physical and aesthetic importance of architecture and 'place' (e.g. the Tianzifang market area); the role and importance of museums and as promotion and training activities in sustaining cultural heritage (e.g. the Daopo Huang Textile Museum); the recognition of 'old brand' enterprises and associated endorsement mechanisms (e.g. China Time-honoured Brand certification plaques); and policy level engagement of the Shanghai regional government with ICH (e.g. official list of protected cultural heritage crafts).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Once the project is completed insights into intangible cultural heritage and the potential role of design interventions for their sustainability will be forthcoming from this acadmeic exchange between UK and China over the next two years, so as to develop a set of conclusions that may be useful to others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A54DC370-C7D8-47DF-A8DE-4BE5008EA4D6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.designecologies.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8A63FD2C-D931-4206-8055-72793F98A2C1"><gtr:id>8A63FD2C-D931-4206-8055-72793F98A2C1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Routledge Handbook of Sustainable Product Design</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/271c0eeb7e850a7a6170ae27080c3efc"><gtr:id>271c0eeb7e850a7a6170ae27080c3efc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walker S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781138910171</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/147436F6-3278-402B-99FC-48C24E2BE306"><gtr:id>147436F6-3278-402B-99FC-48C24E2BE306</gtr:id><gtr:title>DESIGN FOR LIFE -
