Research on all aspects of solar energy capture has increased considerably in recent years because the technical establishments as well as government and business sectors realize both the pressing need and the extraordinary opportunity that exists in the development of green, sustainable sources of energy. Photovoltaic (PV) devices are increasingly competitive based on efficiency, production costs and operating lifetime. Specifically, the best single crystal Si-based PV devices are up to 22% efficient but are currently prohibitively expensive for large-scale use. In contrast, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are only about half this efficient but have the potential to be produced in quantity at far lower cost. However, these and other developing PV technology is limited to generation and storage of electrical energy, and while battery technology is improving, the energy density (weight and molar energy density) in our current batteries is far lower than what is available in fuels. This is why much activity at present is aimed at the direct production of fuel using sunlight. There is, of course, one process already known on Earth that achieves production of &amp;quot;solar fuel&amp;quot; - photosynthesis - although even this process, optimized over billions of years, is less then 1% efficient for most terrestrial plants. It is important therefore to consider every possible route towards harnessing solar energy to produce fuels. In this work we will use a novel range of molecular metal oxides, which have already been shown to be promising catalysts for the oxidation and splitting of water in to hydrogen and oxygen and therefore potentially of use for the generation of solar fuels, by the direct combination with dye-units that can transfer the suns energy to molecular oxide. This will exploit the recent discoveries of the US group (very fast water oxidation with a metal oxide catalyst) and the UK group (growth of microscale tubular architectures when the metal oxide is combined with the dye-cation). This means it is possible to 'grow' catalytic heterostructures that could convert sunlight into fuels on surfaces in with high surface area and robustness opening up a whole new area of science and application to 'fossil' free energy solutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Ensuring a stable energy supply is the central challenge of the 21st century, and this team will highlight the importance of the problem and prepare the next generation of scientists. In additional to the technical goals, this project is envisaged to have broader impacts in four distinct domains: 
1. The successful completion of the scientific goals of this program will transform thinking about catalysis using heterostructured metal oxides derived from molecular building blocks by creating independent modules for studying and optimizing the light and dark processes. These modules, as well as the platform for testing them as a system, will be freely shared with other researchers. 
2. Students and RAs will be important stakeholders in team. Furthermore, the proposed project offers extraordinary training opportunities to students at all levels. Unique to this project is the combination of skills between Glasgow and Emory to create a world leading team in molecular metal oxides and catalysis for the formation of new heterostructured surfaces for solar fuel production.
3. The team exemplifies the globalization of science and will serve as a model for collaboration between the NSF and the EPSRC. Recognizing the importance of international collaboration, we have carefully constructed a trans-Atlantic administrative structure to foster close ties and included funds in the budget to support exchange of scientific personnel between laboratories. 
4. Dissemination of scientific results will be crucial to this project, both to push the boundaries of solar-fuel research and engage the public in understanding a crucial problem. The geographic disparity of the participants provides a unique opportunity to develop web-based solar-fuel resources to engage the international community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319220</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Prof Cronin has appeared on the BBC Radio Scotland &amp;quot;Brainwaves&amp;quot; program, in which he discusses his work, the origin of life, and his development as a scientist.

Scotland is rich in potential sources of renewable energy: solar, wind and wave. 

But sometimes when energy is needed most, the wind isn't blowing or it's dark. If only we could store this intermittently bountiful energy in huge quantities. 

The most common way of doing this at present is pumped storage: when energy is plentiful, use it to pump water uphill to a reservoir, then when extra energy is needed let it flow back downhill again, generating hydroelectricity on the way. 

But there are only so many glens you can flood and the engineering costs are high. 

Prof Cronin's method offers a different future. Electricity from renewable sources would be used to split water, harvest the hydrogen and store it in a liquid for use when it's needed. 

There are of course caveats, not least the fact that this process is still in the laboratory . 

Prof Cronin says it'll take time and money to scale it up to an industrial process: &amp;quot;I think for making something that's going to get into a really large system, it's going to take up to ten years. 

&amp;quot;Hopefully we'll inspire a company to get started and put the technology in that company.&amp;quot;

The process has already been patented and Scottish Enterprise have provided financial support to develop it.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Spin out company created, see Astrea Power
