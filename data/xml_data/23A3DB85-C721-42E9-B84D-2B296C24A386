It is concerned with the complex relationships between local communities, government agencies and the house building industry, at a time of market and public policy uncertainty. Using the Milton Keynes/Northamptonshire area as the laboratory, the project investigates the tensions and debates about new housing developments in three periods: before the slow-down in the housing market, during the property crash period, and in the current period of slow growth, public expenditure reductions and radical changes in Government planning and housing policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using reports and documents (such as local newspapers and planning reports) and interviews with local authorities, developers and community leaders, it will explore how attitudes to new housing among local policymakers have changed, why some areas find it acceptable and some do not. The research will also examine changes in support for sustainable development. Sustainability was a much-publicised objective of the previous government, with the promise to create &amp;quot;sustainable communities&amp;quot; through better urban design (including low carbon buildings), community-based planning and improved public transport, and remains a core element of contemporary planning policy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252404</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Concluding workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8998891D-B5D0-4113-9B24-78F6D41BB4BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop brought together a wide range of colleagues from across the policy/practitioner/provider spectrum, as well as some academics (the majority of participants were not academics).

The findings of the project are directly relevant to current policy debates around planning and housing development because of the way in which they explore the uneasy negotiation that underpins new house building. Our research questions the argument that planning is the principal constraint on development even where pressures for housing growth are high and it also highlights the lack of transparency around issues of viability which make the process seem like a technical rather than a democratic process.
The emerging impact of the project can be briefly summarised under three headings:
1. Engagement with practitioners, policy makers and the public
Throughout its life the project sought to maintain a continuing dialogue with those engaged in policy and practice. The interviews themselves were open discussions rather than merely attempts to extract data from participants, but this approach was also reflected in the workshops organised by the team at the start and end of the project, which drew in a wide range of practitioners from various sectors beyond the academy. Our advisory board was similarly constructed in ways that ensured the voice of practitioners in housing and planning would be heard, as well as to ensure that they would be able to engage with our research. The project web-site was used to ensure that the research was made more widely available - and a series of policy briefs were prepared to link the research to issues of current concern.
Presentations arising from the research were given to wider audiences, including the Midlands Housing Forum and Future City Talks organized by the Fred Roche Foundation in Milton Keynes. Presentations were made to specialist groups, such as the ATLAS group within the Department of Communities and Local Government, as well as the Labour Land Campaign and the Highbury Group on Housing Delivery (an independent group of specialists from the public, private and independent sectors) . A conference on Garden Cities for Tomorrow: A Challenge for the English Midlands was organised through the project (in December 2012) in order to take the debate further - our work contributed to the growing debate around the prospect for a new set of garden cities. 
One of the aims of the Leverhulme Emeritus Fellowship awarded to the Principal Investigator (Professor Allan Cochrane), which runs until the end of September 2015, is to develop the policy relevant work of the project on planning for growth on the edge of a growth region.

2. Informing policy
It is perhaps premature to identify ways in which our work has so far directly influenced policy, but it has certainly been taken up to inform policy-making and policy debate. So, for example, reference has been made to the project and its findings in national reports, such as the Lyons Review as well as a report on housing that has been prepared for the Department of Business Innovation and Skills as part of the Foresight Future Cities programme. We were invited to comment on the draft report by Shelter/KPMG into Building the Homes We Need in 2014 and made a submission to the RTPI for their review of the Value of Planning in the same year. Our work has also fed directly into local planning documents, for example in Northamptonshire Economic Partnership's Strategic Economic Plan and is referred to in the forthcoming report on housing supply in Northamptonshire currently being prepared by Three Dragons/SQW. Members of the research team have been invited to participate in a several workshops and discussions organised by local authorities in the sub-region (and one of the members of the team has been appointed to the Housing Board of the NEP on the strength of the research).
3. More unexpected impacts
One consequence of the research has been to open up questions in areas which were not initially planned. The main example of this relates to questions of openness in the planning process, particularly as it relates to 'viability assessments'. One of the Co-investigators (Dr. Bob Colenutt) was called on to provide an Expert Witness Statement to the Freedom of Information Tribunal hearing on the (successful) appeal by Greenwich Peninsula residents in 2014, and the evidence he provided drew heavily on the work of the project. More recently, he prepared a paper on 'Viability Assessment and Freedom of Information' and made a presentation to the Information Commissioner's Office (February 2015), again drawing directly on the research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2365FF36-915A-4B9A-B849-4EE438128E0A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Lyons Review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D660D372-97D9-4111-8FB4-F18F8E1567A5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.yourbritain.org.uk/uploads/editor/files/The_Lyons_Housing_Review_2.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation Strategic Economic Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C57382F1-0F0E-435E-A324-3985E9D4FB87</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.northamptonshire.gov.uk/en/councilservices/Environ/economic/Documents/PDF%20Documents/SEP%20FINAL%20DOCUMENT.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Housing Strategy Board (Northamptonshire)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E018657C-6222-4667-ADE9-BF0F5546E8EC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation Northamptonshire Housing Study</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8847098C-29A8-4D7E-A33D-2FA3ACA3B9D8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4AA5768D-7D90-4368-A6CB-C82E63FAA120"><gtr:id>4AA5768D-7D90-4368-A6CB-C82E63FAA120</gtr:id><gtr:title>Planning and viability.
