Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/K015346/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease in which inflammation of joints can cause pain, stiffness, lasting damage and disability. It affects an estimated 500,000 people in the UK and has important impacts on their lives. For example, within 5 years of diseases onset, 33% people are unable to remain in full-time work. 
There have been dramatic advances in treatment of RA in recent years. First, patients are treated with drugs as soon as they are diagnosed with RA and the dose is increased quickly to try and suppress all joint inflammation. The most common drug used is called methotrexate (MTX). Second, those people who fail to respond to MTX can be given a biologic drug, so-called because they inhibit a biological pathway involved in inflammation. There are a number of biologic drugs that can be used; most commonly, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapies are used as the first choice biologic. Patients who fail to respond to those are then switched to try a biologic drug that acts by removing B cells from the circulation (rituximab, RTX). More recently, a biologic drug that acts by blocking another inflammatory pathway, the IL6 pathway, has been recommended for use (tocilizumab, TOC). Whilst each of these drugs has been proven to control inflammation and slow or prevent lasting joint damage, they don't work for every patient. Thus, 45% patients fail to respond to MTX whilst 30-40% fail to respond to each of the biologic drugs. At the moment, we have no means of predicting which patients will respond best to which drug and so the drugs are prescribed on a 'trial and error' basis. However, we know that the longer it takes to find an effective therapy, the more joint damage accumulates and the worse the long-term outlook is for patients. Therefore, the aim of this study is to identify predictors of response to MTX, anti-TNF, RTX and TOC so that patients with RA can be given the drug that they are most likely to respond to, as soon as they are diagnosed. 
The response predictors may be changes in DNA, proteins or other molecules and these changes may be detectable in blood samples or in the joint tissues that are inflamed. In this program of work, we plan a comprehensive series of experiments to investigate this. We will study both tissue samples taken from the joints of patients with RA as well as blood samples collected from large numbers of RA patients treated with each of the 4 drugs to be investigated. We will study genetic changes, protein levels and other molecules. We will combine the information obtained to test whether combinations of markers predict response better than studying one marker at a time. We already have evidence to suggest that the number of B cells in the inflamed joint tissue can predict whether patients are likely to respond well to the B cell depleting therapy, RTX. Therefore, we also plan to test how well this works in practice by performing a randomized clinical trial whereby patients will be randomly assigned to receive RTX or another biologic therapy based on the level of B cell infiltration seen in their joint tissue.
The outcome of this study will be the identification of blood or tissue markers that help to target the right treatments to the right patients with RA. This is particularly important because the biologic drugs are very expensive (&amp;pound;8-10,000 per patient per year). Crucially, as the annual cost of biologics to the NHS is ~&amp;pound;160 million, the identification of the 30-40% of non-responders prior to &amp;quot;blind&amp;quot; therapy would potentially save &amp;pound;13-18 million annually because approximately 4-5,000 patients start anti-TNF therapy each year in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Research objectives: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue and blood correlates (WS.1) and large scale blood based screening (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response to four drugs which from the main steps in treatment escalation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA): methotrexate (MTX), anti-tumour necrosis factor (anti-TNF) and rituximab (RTX) and tocilizumab (TOC).
Methodology and experimental design: WS.1: We shall search for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200 patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial (adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. WS.2: we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive analysis to identify that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500 MTX- and 1,200 RTX-treated subjects. 
Proposed techniques and approaches: The two WSs are fully integrated through &amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) incorporating genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies. Both WSs converge in a large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics to identify individual or, more likely, a combination of factors that predict treatment response to each of the four drugs. A preliminary health economic assessment of identified biomarkers will also be undertaken. 
Exploitation of results: In collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential diagnostics for patient benefit</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Commercial beneficiaries:
Immediate commercial beneficiaries are the commercial parties of this consortium including large pharma e.g. Amgen, Pfizer, UCB Pharma, Pfizer, diagnostics companies e.g Qiagen and small biotech e.g. Activiomics.
 
We have developed a strong industry engagement network that has led to a major Industry response with firm intellectual, in-kind and financial contributions from 10 commercial partners (see MICA forms). Industrial partners have been selected to provide expertise in their areas of research, development and commercialisation, as global leaders in the field of therapeutic and (companion) diagnostic development.
 
Testing of the biomarker will have to be standardized before widespread introduction into clinical practice. Thus commercial diagnostics companies will benefit from development of a point-of-care companion diagnostic or delivery of a clinical test in a CLIA lab. Our industry collaborators will provide a means to facilitate direct engagement with large pharmaceutical companies and SMEs.
 
Policy makers: Given the expense of biologic drugs and their significant failure rate, policy makers will benefit from this research. Thus our data will contribute to assessments by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to optimize and rationalize treatment for RA.
 
Patient and public beneficiaries: Ultimately, patients should benefit from this research because it will enable them to be treated earlier in their care pathway with a drug that is most likely to induce remission of symptoms and least likely to induce serious adverse events. This will have downstream consequences for employment and care providers thus having a wider social and economic impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5036988</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MATURA Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>CBA20B06-33EA-4B2E-9B9B-A763B5E000B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Work ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>All partners contribute to Project Steering Group meetings (quarterly) and the annual scientific meeting.

WS1 will analyse synovial markers in the PEAC dataset (http://www.peac-mrc.mds.qmul.ac.uk) and run the prospective randomised clinical trial, STRAP, to test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures in the synovial tissue (pathotypes) can be utilized to predict the response to existing biological therapies.

We will evaluate whether stratification of patients according to their synovial B cell infiltrate (poor or rich phenotypes) will better define response rates.

The Precision Medicine UK: Collaboration Nation event at De Vere Holborn Bars, London, on 9 December was organised on behalf of the Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform by Innovate UK,, National Institute for Health Research, Cancer Research UK,Medical Research Council, Invest Northern Ireland, Health and Care Research Wales and the Knowledge Transfer Network, with the NIHR Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure (NOCRI) coordinating the NIHR's involvement. The day formed part of a programme to make the UK a world leader in precision medicine and provided real-world examples of the discovery and development of precision medicine solutions, through talks, panel discussions, workshops and exhibitions with the opportunity to arrange one-to-one partnering meetings. Precision medicine is an emerging approach to the treatment and diagnosis of disease that takes into account variations in a patient's genes, environment and lifestyle. It aims to better target treatments to an individual's circumstances to improve outcomes for patients. Representatives from across the NIHR were involved in the day and presented on a range of projects and funding programmes. Professor Bryan Williams of NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre joined the first panel of the day which highlighted UK investments in the invention and evaluation phase of research. Professor Williams' highlighted key NIHR's investments in this space and provided examples of exciting precision medicine projects from UCLH BRC. In addition, a number of NIHR precision medicine projects were presented during the disease area specific showcase sessions. This included Professor Costantino Pitzalis who presented the THERAPIST study on behalf of the NIHR Translational Research Partnership, Professor Simon Mead's who presented a project at NIHR Queen's Square Biomedical Research Unit on the &amp;quot;dementia chip&amp;quot; and Professor Tariq Sadiq's who presented on Capacity Building and Delivery of Precision Medicine in Sexual Health, through NIHR Funding. Mark Samuels, Managing Director of NOCRI, also chaired a discussion panel themed 'Enabling Collaboration', which highlighted the value of collaborative working between companies, academics, charities and patients. The event saw the launch by the chief executive of Innovate UK, Dr Ruth McKernan, of a new map of the precision medicine landscape. A whole range of organisations, including charities, health bodies and devolved administrations are coordinating their work under the umbrella of Innovate UK's Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform, with NOCRI representing the NIHR.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MATURA Patient Advisory Group presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0BC275E8-03BB-4C0D-BB0E-4D1576BF9D1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Findings from work carried out in MATURA relating to blood biomarkers to predict response to therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented, generating considerable discussion.

The MRC-MATURA TranSMART platform enables researchers to:

Develop, test and refine research hypotheses
Search multiple data sets for potential drug targets, pathways and biomarkers
Compare data from proteomics, metabolomics and other &amp;quot;omics&amp;quot; studies
Contrast patterns of gene expression in healthy and diseased individuals and tissue samples
Investigate correlations between genotype and phenotype in clinical trial data
Study genetic and environmental factors involved in RA
Display data visually using a graphical interface
Stratify clinical data into molecular subtypes of RA disease and drug response
