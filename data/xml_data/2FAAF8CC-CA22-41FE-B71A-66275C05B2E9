For example, from July last year, British citizens became unable to bring their dependent non- European Economic Area (EEA) elderly parents to join them in Britain, but for under highly restrictive and exceptional circumstances. Non-EEA spouses and children of British citizens are also unable to join them in Britain unless stringent base earnings requirements are met. Stripping people of citizenship through deprivation proceedings is also a new development. 
Such change (and its contestation by '&amp;quot;quasi-citizens&amp;quot;) takes place in the legal &amp;quot;juridical field&amp;quot; by virtue of the prominence of law and its practice. However, in the UK at present, there are no comprehensive empirical studies of the role of law and lawyers in citizenship-related issues. Migration studies tend to focus on refugees and asylum seekers.
This 3 year inter-disciplinary research project will address critical issues relating to immigration law and its practice by focusing on the practice of law for long term British residents who are deprived of full substantive citizenship rights and thereby remain &amp;quot;quasi-citizens&amp;quot;. Through this study it will be possible to analyze how far British citizenship has changed in recent times, as well as the implications of these changes for long term residents and the legal field. The legal field, as the arena for both contesting and constituting changes to citizenship, will be explored using French social scientist Pierre Bourdieu's concept of the juridical field, while employing mapping and social network analysis. 
The project will cross a number of disciplines and integrate social insights of multiple stakeholders through in-depth qualitative interviews with lawyers, case workers and focus groups, as well as ethnographic fieldwork at law centres. Through analysis of ties between, and contributions of, different immigration stake-holders (such as the government, lawyers, case workers, policy makers, regulators and civil society bodies), the project is directed both towards generating socio-legal academic scholarship and towards increasing the capacity of the legal profession so that it can work more effectively for the full inclusion of long term British residents into British society in compliance with the rule of law. Ultimately this will help foster a fairer, more just and inclusive society, and thus it directly addresses ESRC's strategic priority of a Vibrant and Fair Society. 
Additionally, the project will enable the PI's participation in inter-disciplinary research networks on citizenship theory and immigration law practice, both in the UK and elsewhere, thereby consolidating her position as an emerging expert in this field and building upon her earlier work on lawyers and the rule of law in the UK and the USA (Prabhat 2008, 2011). 
The various dimensions of the project are:
1. Research visits to Centre on Migration, Policy, and Society, (COMPAS) Oxford University, Center for Comparative Immigration Studies, San Diego, USA, and to the Migration and Diversity Centre, VU University, Amsterdam.
2. Interviews and fieldwork with lawyers and case workers 
3. Mapping and social networks analysis, alongside the creation of an interactive website for on-going research, reflection and co-production of knowledge with multiple stakeholders. 
4. Impact activity, including collaborations on practical legal education guided by an Impacts Advisory Board, which will include experts on practical legal education from Law Schools at the University of Kent, University of Liverpool and New York University.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH AND HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

(a) Group 1 - The government (via the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and the Joint Committee on Human Rights), the regulators of the legal profession in England &amp;amp; Wales (the SRA and the Legal Services Board) and the membership organization the Immigration Law Practitioners Association (ILPA) need to be able to understand: i. the implications of legal changes in nationality laws; ii. the role and conduct of lawyers in the field of immigration law iii. the resources available for representation and iv. human rights implications of legal changes and representation in this area.
The policy briefings, website entries and articles will benefit Group 1 by offering a study, based on rigorous empirical research, of how lawyers perceive their role and function. This group will also benefit from the two day symposium in Year 3 of the project, which will offer them a space in which to interact with other stakeholders (in particular, academics and legal professionals). Promoting a shared and better understanding of the nature of the complex issues linked to nationality laws in immigration legal practice will enhance the likelihood that the various stakeholders involved will be able to work together to achieve better regulation in the future.

(b) Group 2 - Legal professionals in various sites of practice (such as law centres, legal aid firms and NGOs), will benefit from analysis of what constitutes and aids effective lawyering in this area. Research generated by this project will lead to practice advice for legal professionals who seek to be reflective and critical of their own work practices. The PI will produce a briefing paper on best practice in &amp;quot;quasi-citizenship&amp;quot; cases. This group will also benefit from the development of a training workshop for lawyers and from the project website which will connect lawyers to each other and to civil society actors and legal academics. This group will also benefit from the reflective space generated by the interviews and focus groups, in which they can take the time to think about their work.

(c) Group 3 - Civil society bodies working in the area of migration will benefit from opportunities to reflect on more effective collaboration with lawyers and how to frame legal issues; an area for which legal aid has been cut. This group will also benefit from the project website which will connect them to legal practitioners and academics thereby facilitating pro bono (free legal services). The public lecture in Year 3 of the project and the media articles written during the lifetime of the project will benefit this group by assisting them in framing legal issues. 

(d) Group 4- Quasi-citizens and the general public. This project will contribute to public information and debate in this area through media (traditional and social) participation, as well as direct dissemination of findings (public lecture). Media coverage of immigration issues and of lawyers is often negative. Media outreach aspects of this project will bring into the public domain other images of both lawyers and long term residents, thereby facilitating public debates.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>244381</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stories of Migration and Citizenship</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0AE6C098-CB8D-4A08-8B2F-A9BF1C51D12B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://policybristol.blogs.bris.ac.uk/2016/12/19/sharing-stories-of-migration-and-belonging/ describes the event
