Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L005182/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The High Street UK 2020 project will support high street change through knowledge exchange. The project will connect key high street stakeholders (retailers, town centre partnerships, local authorities, property owners/developers and residents) in 10 locations (Alsager, Altrincham, Ballymena, Barnsley, Bristol, Congelton, Holmfirth, Market Rasen, Morley and Wrexham) with the knowledge and intelligence they need to deliver a sustainable high street in 2020. Project objectives include:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>completing a state-of-the art review of major factors that contribute to retail centre change&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>identifying a hierarchy of effects in retail and retail centre change, using the literature review and a panel of retail and spatial experts&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>developing the High Street UK model of retail centre change&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>enabling user communities to forecast retail centre change in their specific retail location, using the High Street UK forecasting model&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>building a Framework for High Street Intervention with four main components of 'repositioning', 'reinventing', 'rebranding' and 'restructuring' based on the management and marketing literature&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>developing a series of sustainable centre plans (based on the Framework for High Street Intervention) with the 10 partner locations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>sharing a suite of legacy products, such as the modelling tool, podcasts from academic experts and a special issue of the Journal of Place Management and Development.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A wide range of stakeholders will benefit from this project. Retail academics involved in the project will gain key new insights into the knowledge exchange process to build on its previous experience, and will derive new understanding of the retail sector and the high street, their needs, drivers and development opportunities. In addition, the utilisation of the Delphi Technique using academic experts from a range of disciplines (retail, geography, planning, urban regeneration, public administration, management, marketing etc.) will foster cross-disciplinary knowledge exchange, helping to broaden the 'real-world' understanding of a research problem in context (the changing nature of the high street) by the end of the project (2014). Broader academic impact about the benefits of knowledge exchange will be achieved through the publication of a special issue of the Journal of Place Management and Development.

Private sector - A range of business will also benefit from the project. For example, retailers and other high street commercial operators (such as retail property owners) will learn first hand about specific opportunities on their high street and how to work collectively and adapt their businesses to exploit these opportunities (such as meeting the needs of an ageing population) by 2020. This will enhance the efficiency, performance and sustainability of high street businesses/organisations. The UK High Street 2020 forecasting model will also be available to commercial operators (such as Springboard) that support the retail sector (such as providers of retail data) to improve the quality of service they provide, thereby improving the quality of decision making effecting the retail sector and the high street. 

Policy-makers - Those previously responsible for managing change on the high street at a local level (predominantly local authorities) will have a simple interactive tool to model the diverse range of impacts on the high street as well as a range of possible interventions to bring about sustainable change. A quote from our partners, Ballymena council illustrates this &amp;quot;While I understand the work is subject to funding the project comes at a very appropriate time for us. Our overarching strategy of 'Destination Ballymena' encompasses everything we do in terms of Councils core objectives&amp;quot;. The 10 sustainable high street action plans developed within this project will add to the evidence base to inform national policy surrounding, for example, high street innovation, regeneration, planning and localism. 

Third and public sectors - More actors who have agency to bring about change on the high street will be trained in using the modelling tool and the range of interventions available to them, thereby empowering them with data and knowledge that would not normally be available to them. This will contribute to increasing public awareness and understanding of science, economic and societal issues. Strengthening local partnerships and their role in managing change is an integral part of this project and involves a wide range of stakeholders from the public, private and third sectors, such as local residents associations etc. This enhances the efficiency and performance of public services, as it builds local capacity for local economic development and regeneration and enhancing cultural enrichment. A sustainable high street will improve the quality of life of local communities. Healthy high streets contribute toward wealth creation and economic prosperity i.e. the creation and growth of local companies and jobs; enhancing business revenue in the local economy and innovation within a specific location as well as providing opportunities for cultural and social exchange, leisure, exercise and education. The project will impact on the quality of life of thousands of UK citizens, who are regular users of high street services and space, or could be, if they met the needs of local communities more effectively.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>111935</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Springboard</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Improving the customer expereince in retail: Bringing big data to small users</gtr:description><gtr:id>E067ACCD-69F5-4C15-9C78-CB43D9A3CEB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A funding bid for innovate, which is now through to the second round.

Activities such as identification of local variations for each town led to discussions about ways of attracting and engaging more people in partnerships. 

Project findings were cascaded to a diverse range of local stakeholders in all towns: town centre managers, major retailers, independent retailers, market managers, supermarkets, retail property owners, shopping centre managers, local politicians, MPs, mayors, council officers (economic development, planning, tourism, town centre services), residents, volunteers, charities, headteachers, planning consultants, SMEs, youth workers, care workers, civic society and local history groups, gallery owners, banks, restaurants and bars, fast-food outlets, leisure operators and the police. 

Improved understanding of factors affecting town centres amongst a diverse group of stakeholders. Raised awareness of the importance and availability of evidence for decision making.

After completion of these workshops, the majority of town partnerships started to look at how to build on the discussions and how to find champions for the 25 top priorities identified in the HSUK2020 research. 

The workshops helped partnerships to engage and meet with local stakeholders; as a direct result of these workshops, some partnerships managed to grow as more people decided to participate in shaping their town's future and volunteer in projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/general-news/top-priorities-to-save-town-s-high-streets-revealed-1-6704432</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future of the High Street Conference, Inside Government, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>706A145C-8247-40BC-A028-D0826E30094D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Strong interest in 25 priorities for the High Street we developed from research.

The project is co-funded by Innovate UK, as part of the Enhancing User Experience in Retail funding competition. It is primarily a collaboration between Springboard and MMU, and will will help high streets future proof themselves, by generating much-needed place intelligence; enabling stakeholders to develop a more relevant collective offer. Springboard is thrilled to be working with MMU that led the High Street UK 2020 project, which demonstrated retail centres with a clear collective offer, fare much better than those without. 

A series of activities involving 35-40 participants from our 16 project partners have been held during 2016-2017. In these events, we are working towards developing new data-driven tools designed to help the constituents of town and city centres align their offer to the expectations of their catchment, making them more successful and better places to visit.

The workshops sparked lively discussion about the future of British high streets. Much of this discussion centred on the obstacles to setting up new independent retail on the high street, as well as broader planning issues. Discussion also included ideas about encouraging residential development in centres. The workshops also revealed some really interesting local examples such as the work of Portadown TCP and the work of the Coastal Housing Group in Swansea. In general the view of RICS members is that the commercial priorities of landowners and property rental companies were a significant barrier to new independent retail business. We would suggest, therefore, a new research agenda is emergent here.

Having completed the workshops we have received positive letters/emails from Carmarthenshire County Council, Cherwell District Council, The Coastal Housing Group and several independent RICS members.

In addition, this project has identified and validated footfall data as a useful measure of town centre vitality. By analysing historical footfall data using our hierarchy of factors of influence, we have been able to identify emerging new town types, based upon activity - which will form the basis of important new research questions such as 'how are towns adapting to the reduction of comparison shopping?'
