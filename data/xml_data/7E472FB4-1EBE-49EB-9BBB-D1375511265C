Since 2010, when the Greek government and IMF/EU/ECB agreed on the largest loan ever received by a single country, Greece has seen sweeping transformations in the character of its polity and state functions. The Greek version of the crisis has produced a rupture in the modus operandi of the state in question and in its relationship with its citizenry. The main axis of this rupture is the systemic challenge and reconfiguration of the category 'public' - which of course includes public spaces. This research focuses on the newly emerging public socialities in reference to public urban spaces. The idea of emphasizing spontaneous and unspontaneous socio-spatial practices, public urban materialities and spatialities in the capital city of Greece appears as an ideal way in which to study the wide variety of the social consequences of the financial crisis.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project sees achieving maximum societal impact as a priority and for this reason, key intended users/beneficiaries have already been identified and approached. These are organisations concerned with the enhancement of the quality of life and with an increase in the effectiveness of public services and policies. Both proposed user-reviewers fit this description: the Project for Public Spaces (PPS), the world leader in its sector, is a NYC-based organisation dedicated to planning, design and education aiming to help create and sustain public spaces that build stronger communities across the world. The project includes a 3-month study visit at the CUNY Center for Place, Culture and Politics, during which an opportunity for further knowledge exchange with PPS will be achieved. The Hellenic League of Human Rights (HLHR) is the second proposed user-reviewer and the oldest such NGO in the country. A series of phenomena linked with the current crisis (including impoverishment, increase in homelessness, police brutality, riots, increase in criminality and concentration of refugees without documents in down-town Athens) are closely linked with violation of human rights and are located precisely within the urban public spaces that the project seeks to examine. It is for this reason that the term 'humanitarian crisis' is increasingly used in the discourse describing the emerging situation in the Greek capital city by media and civil society actors alike. A research project on public spaces in Athens would therefore necessarily include human rights-related issues as a crucial parameter. 
 
Both organisations, along with several other third sector and/or international organisations (e.g. UNHCR-Greece that has been contacted already), will be invited to join a response group that will meet three times during the project's duration under the leadership of the PI to discuss questions, methods, research results and to exchange knowledge. At least one of the research outputs, namely the policy report written by the PI and a socio-legal researcher of the project partner (the Institute for Rights Equality and Diversity) will explicitly aim to benefit such users. 
 
The established links with the aforementioned organisations will be used to disseminate the findings to other potential beneficiaries that some of these organisations have access to, including those Greek government departments and city of Athens authorities dealing with public spaces and urban infrastructures in particular. Furthermore, non-academic users will include transnational organisations with an interest in the Greek/Euro crisis, in particular the organisations with a direct financial interest at stake at the current crisis - i.e. the loan-offering institutions: the IMF, EU and ECB. 
 
Furthermore, the research aims to benefit citizen groups and community activists participating in the movements to reclaim public spaces and related anti-austerity movements that have been active in the city of Athens in the wake of, and during the outbreak of, the crisis. The research will provide much-needed knowledge in order for them to develop a well-informed position into the public debates around the crisis. The existing networks of the local research assistants will be instrumental for that knowledge exchange. 
 
The project will include two additional, widely available outputs, besides the policy report and the academic publication. The inclusion of these two additional outputs, a documentary film and an interactive webpage, aims to maximise the project's impact and to ensure a high degree of dissemination of the research findings. It is expected that both outputs will exceed the duration of the project. The mid-term and long term impact of these outputs is to provide the initial evaluation of everyday life under crisis and related applied policies and to contribute to the ongoing debates about the transformations of the notions of &amp;quot;public&amp;quot; across Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>165042</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This film is part of the research project crisis-scape.net



The neo-_azi party Golden Dawn has been active in Greece since the mid-1980s. Through the years, GD has attacked migrants, antifascists and homosexuals, often with the tolerance or even the collaboration of parts of the Greek police force. In recent years, the party saw a largely unexplained soaring in its funding, a broad coverage of its activities (whether real or fictitious) by mainstream media and the opening up of more than fifty local branches across Athenian neighborhoods and Greek cities.



The ostensibly meteoric rise of the GD in mainstream political discourse came at an extremely critical conjuncture, amidst the global financial crisis that hit Greece hard from approximately 2008/09 onward. In the 2009 national elections, GD had received a mere 0.2% of the vote; in 2012, its share sky-rocketed to approximately 7%. The electoral success of GD was matched by the introduction of anti-migration policies by the government coalition, often-encountered police operations specifically targeting anti-fascist activists in Athens and other Greek cities and the rise of racist attacks in the country.



On September 18th a self-confessed GD member, Giorgos Roupakias, stabbed anti-fascist rap musician Pavlos Fyssas (aka Killah-P) to death. In the aftermath of the assassination the GD leader, Nikos Mihaloliakos, and key GD MPs and members have been arrested and charged. Only now, after decades of presence in the Greek political landscape, the GD's connections to the country's security forces and political establishment are untangled and exposed in mainstream political discourse and in the media.

This documentary film traces the multiple transformations of crisis-ridden Athenian public space and those who traverse it.



In three parts, Future Suspended navigates its way through the past and the present of the crisis as it gets inscribed in Athens dwellers' minds, and as it plays out in their everyday lives. The first section, Privatised, explores the legacy of mass privatisation projects that preceded the 2004 Olympics, placing them in the context of present-day privatisation schemes.



Part two, Devalued, examines the ever-shrinking spaces of migrants in the city and the violent devaluation that comes as a result. The final third, Militarised, explains how, at the exact moment when the state recedes from its welfare functions, this devaluation of Athenian lives becomes a generalised condition.



Combining geography, anthropology, urban theory and research with visual research methods and digital design, the project has attempted to read the enormous (and often devastating) social and political change playing out before our eyes through the marks it leaves on spaces of the everyday.



The rise of racism and xenophobia and the establishment of unprecedented policing are viewed through supposedly prosaic urban sites: the Athenian metro, the city's old and new airports, its highways, squares and streets.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D88AFDFC-D53B-4FF6-8FC0-BB03CBD48BD1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Future Suspended</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>In this film, shot between May 2010 and June 2012, Dr. Dimitris Dalakoglou explains the ongoing social meltdown taking place in Greece as a consequence of the crisis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6C9ECAC4-DA47-4C4B-A795-773EA91B4287</gtr:id><gtr:title>Athens: Social Meltdown</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Relying upon the readings of two lawyers, it attempts a passage through the dark landscapes that the new dogma of public security leaves in its wake. And it chooses to view the crisis as a way of managing urban everydayness, as a way of managing it militarily. It comprises a thematic intervention-deflection as part of The Space That Remains, a research strand of the project The City at a Time of Crisis. Yet through its deflecting characteristics it simply reaffirms the initial fears that led to the creation of this research strand. In other words, it confirms that the space that remains is ever-lessening and that the state of emergency educates us to live, in the end, with this loss.

Yet despite and against shallow journalistic interpretations, there is nothing humanitarian about it. This is because for them the crisis was from the upstart orchestrated politically, socially and militarily. In this way, the discourse about racism in crisis-ridden Greece merely obfuscates and comes in handy. For it obscures exactly how structural this devaluation had been for the development of the Greek state in itself, as well as for the self-perception of Greek society. Yet the crisis knows how to twist meanings too. Today, migrants are accused of the very decline of the Greek edifice. And within this twisted world, their devaluation takes on a more offensive and, at the same time, a more legitimate form. Impossible Biographies, as part of the research project The City at a Time of Crisis, bears witness to this offensive. Today, just like yesterday, the devalued lives of migrants shall remind us how it is to live and die within an enforced anonymity and invisibility. How it is to live a life whose biography is impossible.

TCATC played a key role in highlighting issues of racially motivated attacks in Athens' public spaces, helping to massively shift public attitude toward them. Knowledge exchange with key stakeholders and building capacity through the deployment of a crowd-sourced mapping tool was key in maximising its impact. Having since enjoyed formidable exposure in international media, including Russia Today and The Guardian, the TCATC project has achieved both a broad and targeted impact in the international public sphere. 

Given the pertinence of the research topic to current public debates concerning the financial crisis, and the key position of Greece within these, one of the three main objectives of TCATC has been the widespread dissemination and targeting of the research findings in shaping international debates. For this reason, the project incorporated dissemination in its original budgeting, employing an in-house Technical Assistand solely for the purpose of dissemination, while also establishing partnerships with private sector practitioners, including an award-winning filmmaker. The principles guiding the project's pathway to impact are as follows: A participatory approach, producing outputs that take into account knowledge exchange with potential research users. Dynamic and constant flow of research outputs via weekly updates on the project website. Free and open access to key research outputs through a Creative Commons (CC) license. Widespread dissemination of outputs and datasets to key groups, organisations and media/social media by combining captivating interactive visual elements and video with more in-depth analysis. The participatory approach has been facilitated by the establishment of response groups comprising of potential research users and stakeholders, involving them in the design, execution and presentation stages of the research. In the early project stages, potential users and stakeholders were approached and a process of systematic knowledge exchange was initiated aiming toward a more participatory development of the project. Such users and stakeholders included well-established Athens-based NGOs (such as the Greek Council for Refugees, Solidarity for All, Doctors of the World); major international organisations (such as the UNHCR and the OECD); members of Athens' Municipal Council (Eleni Portaliou); representatives of migrant communities and support organisations in the city (such as the Network for Migrant Rights, the Pakistani Community Association and the Afghan Community Association) and key professional associations (including the Merchants' Association of Athens). A common issue raised by almost every stakeholder in the meetings concerned the increase of racist violence in the city's public spaces. Through the research, it became evident that the actual extent of racist violence had been vastly underestimated in official discourse and in existent academic research alike. Up to that point, no official statistics were compiled regarding racially motivated crimes in Greece, while many of the victims were undocumented and therefore unable to report these crimes to the police. The Racist Violence Recording Network, an independent body of NGOs mediated by the UNHCR, had been gathering its own data, but faced seemingly insurmountable challenges in gathering and verifying such information. In addition, the network's reports were published bi-annually, which effectively meant there was no regularly updated public record of these attacks. The mapping project was conceived in order to address these issues. From the date when it commenced, TCATC launched an interactive website updated on a weekly basis since - thereby ensuring a regular audience and establishing itself as a source of reliable, scholarly knowledge that is publicly available, open and free to use. In this way, when the map was launched in April 2013, it met an already existent audience and was immediately catapulted to the centre of ongoing international debates about the social and political future of Greece. Datasets and texts from the website have been reproduced and translated from English into five languages (Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French) thereby reaching an even more international audience. The project website has had a visitor count in excess of 130,000, within a period of just over twelve months. The number increases dramatically if the reproduction of TCATC content in other media outlets is taken into account. Beyond scholarly analysis, the website has been updated weekly to offer photographic and video material from the field, all offered under the same creative commons license and more accessible to a wider audience of academics and non-academics alike. Since its launch, the interactive map documenting racist attacks has been instrumental in re-framing debates and behaviors on the question of migration in Athens and Greece overall. NGOs, international and local organizations working on migration have all been actively using the online interactive map in their everyday work as an up-to-date reference, an advocacy tool and as a means to engage in debates. As extreme-right violence increased in late summer of 2013, resulting in the arrest of the leadership of the Golden Dawn party, the use of the map spiked overnight, even momentarily causing a server overload. The in-house TA instantly migrated the map to dedicated SSD servers where it has since been able to accommodate the dramatic increase in traffic caused by the growth of the map's popularity per se, as well as rapid social and political developments in the country overall: in September 2013 alone, the map was visited by over 50,000 unique users. Since the end of the TCATC project (in May 2014), it is already evident that its multimedia outputs and datasets - and the map of racist attacks in particular - hold a value and relevance that extends far beyond this end date.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F5C97D1D-0C4F-497A-9E78-0436BBFE4C32</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Security and Diplomacy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The City at a time of Crisis project (henceforth CTATC) studied the new forms of governance of public spaces and the changing notions and experiences of public spaces that economic crisis has provoked in Athens. The project findings may be summarised as follows:

Curtailing of Political Activism
We found a considerable shrinkage in the expression of political discourse in Athens' public spaces, with an apparently focused attempt by the country's authorities to curtail public speech and the right to protest. This attempt included, for example, an unprecedented operation to evict some of Athens' longest-standing social centres, which was studied extensively and in depth by TCATC. 
Discriminatory Control of Public Space
In addition, TCATC found that the Greek police placed considerable weight on a more rigid control of the city's public spaces, applying policies of racial and ethnic discrimination. Police operation &amp;quot;Xenios Zeus&amp;quot;, which commenced in August 2012, saw the detention of over 84,000 migrants within its first seven months alone. The Greek government has been repeatedly criticized by international human rights organisation and media for a racist and xenophobic stance against migrants. Several of these reports referenced and quoted the work of TCATC. 
Increase in Racist Attacks 
TCATC recorded and proved a tremendous increase in racially motivated physical attacks. The scale and geographical spread of these attacks was recorded through TCATC's digital &amp;quot;racist attacks map&amp;quot;, which was covered extensively in national and international media alike (including The Guardian and Al Jazeera) and international organisations (including UNHCR and AI), winning considerable praise for raising an extremely serious social issue outside academia ? and achieving very substantial impact as a result. 
Social Alienation
The TCATC project found that the on-going financial crisis has had formidable impact on everyday interaction between the city's dwellers, radically altering the urban experience for many in return. Increasing tendencies of social alienation were ethnographically recorded through daily interaction within the contexts of mass transport, the streets and the squares of the city of Athens. 
Infrastructural Decay
Finally, the city is witnessing both a privatisation of its public land stock and considerable deterioration in its physical infrastructure and infrastructural flows as direct outcomes of privatisation and public disinvestment led by the crisis. The transportation links and flows of the Greek capital have been reduced considerably, with areas of lower- and middle-income taking the heaviest toll. In addition, the flows of the city's materialities (e.g. construction, energy, waste) have been slowed down ? often brought to a halt ? due to general impoverishment, and wage and staff cuts to key public worker sectors.

Future research plans to study the militarisation, privatisation and tighter policing of Athens, and explore the solidarity movements that have emerged as grassroots responses to these economic and structural conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The TCATC findings have already been reported and analysed via the weekly updates on the project's website; the fifteen published essays; six documentary films and the project's first book 'Crisis-scapes: Athens and Beyond'. 
CITY's annual event of 2014 will be dedicated to TCATC, screening our final documentary film 'Future Suspended' and hosting talks by the research team in London. Furthermore the forthcoming issue of the journal CITY is the result of the end of the project conference in Athens. In addition to over ten papers given already to various universities (e.g. Princeton, CUNY, LSE, Oxford) the grant-holder is the key-note speaker in the annual conference of CASA (Prague). From September to December 2014 he is invited to give papers to the Universities of Oxford, Belfast, Hamburg, London and Sussex. Papers will be presented at the next EASA, AAA, ASA and AAG meetings, while an extra book is prepared to be submitted to a publisher by the end of 2014. The public screenings of the project's documentary (including NYC, London, Athens) were sold out, so more screening have been scheduled. 
All the TCATC digital infrastructure and outputs are still online with free access under CC licence, rather than copyright, maximizing dissemination. The webpage has circa 100,000 views already; the films have another 120,000 online views and the first book has over 10,000 downloads while hardcopies are sold-out. Simultaneously the project has been featured by media outlets such as the Guardian and Al Jazeera. The grant holder has been invited to speak to high profile events such as the World Political Forum in Istanbul in October 2014. 

TCATC organised regular meetings with end-users in Athens (including NGOs, communities of migrants and activists) and abroad (Project for Public Spaces, NYC). Thus end-users were incorporated into the development of the project ? paving the way for the exploitation of these findings. 

TCATC's outcomes have also already raised awareness of the social and societal deterioration caused by the crisis ? including financial impoverishment, infrastructural poverty and deterioration in the urban environment, everyday social relationships and mental health of the population. It is anticipated, for this reason, that the project outcomes will be used in the future by NGO's and other third-sector organisations working on these issues.

TCATC's map of racist attacks holds one of the greatest potential for societal impact in the future: key end-users, including migrant communities in Athens, have already contributed to the mapping and it is anticipated to be used as a tool facilitating future legal campaigns against racist violence and/or police negligence ? as well as public awareness campaigns.

Partly due to the dissemination of the project's findings Greek authorities have changed their attitude towards racist crimes, having for the first time explicit antiracist laws being passed in Greece. TCATC has also been instrumental in recasting the international and public reputation of the Greek neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn.

The project has highlighted the relationships between austerity, poverty, racism, extremism and urban infrastructural transformations. These findings have the potential to set an agenda for our understanding of the economic crisis and its ramifications not only in Greece, but also across other nations of Europe - particularly the so-called 'PIGS' nations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0961CCAE-943F-4798-9224-DD20E1C560B2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crisis-scape.net</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The timeline gives an overview of events related to the crisis in Greece on a local, national and global scale from 2008 until now.

Methodologically this map is based on crowdsourcing, this means that everyone can submit information about an incident. Every effort is made for the information to be verified, but this is not always possible. In that case incidents are not published or if they are published are flagged as unverified. If you have evidence that any of the incidents are unverified or false please contact us. 



But who are we? We are a group doing research on the impact of the crisis on urban spaces in Athens, including the rise in racist violence in the city and beyond. The map has been developed as part of our project &amp;quot;City at a Time of Crisis&amp;quot;:

We are unaffiliated with any political party and several of us have been active in the area of counter information across Europe for some years. As part of the project we are initiating a network of trusted sources. Feel free to contact us if you want to get involved.



You can also submit information to the map by emailing

info@crisis-scape.net



or by filling in the form directly on this website. We will then verify the report by checking additional sources where possible, and then allow the incident to appear on the map.



Reports can be submitted anonymously but require that you submit an email address so that we can contact you if we need to clarify any details (all email addresses will be secure and hidden from the public). We accept reports in most languages and will translate them into English for the map.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD234CA6-7D11-4DF9-A9F9-B5F81524811E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The map had hundrends of thousand online views while it reproduced by the Guardian, Al Jazeera and various NGOs and intrenational organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Map of Racist Attacks in Athens</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://map.crisis-scape.net</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5BC0895-47B2-4D9C-B74A-5A175851051E"><gtr:id>D5BC0895-47B2-4D9C-B74A-5A175851051E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Beyond Spontaneity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>City</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0"><gtr:id>d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dalakoglou D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/18D55086-7F6A-45C9-B60E-3252534C1F21"><gtr:id>18D55086-7F6A-45C9-B60E-3252534C1F21</gtr:id><gtr:title>'From the Bottom of the Aegean Sea' to Golden Dawn: Security, Xenophobia, and the Politics of Hate in Greece</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Studies in Ethnicity and Nationalism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0"><gtr:id>d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dalakoglou D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1587B75-829C-40A9-B052-CAFA46B7E448"><gtr:id>B1587B75-829C-40A9-B052-CAFA46B7E448</gtr:id><gtr:title>The crisis before the 'crisis': Violence and urban neoliberalization in Athens</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/afae6cc1bf4dde7e76f8593d278e4ce6"><gtr:id>afae6cc1bf4dde7e76f8593d278e4ce6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames> Dimitrios D (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0C3E6B4F-19C0-43A5-B45B-766B8BBAB037"><gtr:id>0C3E6B4F-19C0-43A5-B45B-766B8BBAB037</gtr:id><gtr:title>Neo-Nazism and Neoliberalism: A Few Comments on Violence in Athens At the Time of Crisis</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>WorkingUSA</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0"><gtr:id>d929b2e086f2515cb0e1fb485163d1f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dalakoglou D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K001663/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
