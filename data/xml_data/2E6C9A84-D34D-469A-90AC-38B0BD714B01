In an NMR experiment, the nuclei are first magnetised by placing a sample in a strong magnetic field for some time. A sequence of radiofrequency pulses is then applied to the sample, which subsequently emits radiowaves which are detected in the radio receiver. The pattern of emitted waves provides information on the chemical composition and spatial distribution of the sample. One application of NMR is called Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This is used in hospitals to construct images of the interior of the human body, and is enormously useful for the diagnosis of diseases and injuries. 

The magnetic resonance research centre of the University of Southampton is a world-leading facility for NMR and MRI research development. We are currently developing techniques which enhance NMR signals by factors of many thousands, which may lead to methods for the clinical detection and diagnosis of cancer by MRI, as well as numerous other applications in materials science, biochemistry, analytical chemistry, and quantum physics. The user group is growing rapidly in size, as is the range of research activities and collaborations. Our core research portfolio is supported by grants mostly from EPSRC, the Royal Society, and the EU Commission, with a total value in excess of &amp;pound;8M. These include recent awards of a &amp;pound;1.8M EPSRC Platform Grant and a &amp;pound;2.9M award from the EU Commission under the extremely competitive Future and Emerging Technologies - Open (FETopen) scheme. 

This proposal seeks funding for upgrading NMR spectrometers that underpin cutting-edge research in magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging at the University of Southampton. Funds are requested for (i) the replacement of an ageing and obsolete 400MHz NMR console by a modern sem; (ii) replacement of a second ageing 400MHz NMR console by a modern 700MHz system; (iii) provision of a workhorse 400MHz NMR console to enhance the productivity and capabilities of our homebuilt equipment which is capable of enhancing NMR signals by large factors. We will reuse our existing NMR magnets so as to keep costs down. These upgrades and replacements will being our research facility up to the international standard and significantly enhance our capability to perform, expand, and apply our cutting-edge research capabilities, in a highly cost-effective manner.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact for the project will mainly come through the research enabled by the underpinning equipment proposed, in the following categories:

1. Knowledge: Magres@soton, in collaboration with external partners, has a strong track record of producing excellent scientific results, both on the fundamental and the applied side of research. This knowledge will mainly be spread through publications in high-impact scientific journals and conference appearances. Much of the work underpinned by the proposed equipment concerns advances in magnetic resonance methodology, which will benefit other areas of science such as biology, materials science, analytical science, and medical imaging.

2. Society and Economy: The research underpinned has significant commercial relevance. Hyperpolarised NMR is targeted as a commercial opportunity by several companies, some of them headquartered in the UK. Integration of microfluidic technology with high-resolution NMR spectroscopy, another priority at Magres@soton, could find important applications in the life sciences and in healthcare, with corresponding commercial opportunities. Several collaboration projects underpinned by the proposed equipment immediately target commercially important systems, such as petrochemical catalysts, drug candidates, and novel materials.

3. People: Magnetic resonance is an advanced and complex analytical tool. Its application in science, medicine, and engineering requires highly trained specialists, who have direct experience in working with current hardware. The proposed equipment will be operated by postdoctoral research fellows, postgraduate students, and undergraduate project students, who will be fully trained in its use. This conveys a directly marketable skill, the value of which will be considerably enhanced by the proposed equipment. On the one hand, it will provide access to contemporary kit, which is more job-relevant than working with obsolescent hardware, and it will significantly increase throughput, making space for a corresponding increase in student populations.

4. Public Outreach: The magnetic resonance systems feature prominently in various public outreach programmes at the University, Faculty, and School level. For example, we annually host a number of secondary school students in the &amp;quot;Chemistry Work Shadow&amp;quot; programme, where they get direct exposure to advanced NMR systems.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1999099</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P030491/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F442B6BE-8B89-4C01-8D3B-E8A4D320B672</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biomolecules &amp; biochemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>60EBB420-734E-4DB5-B0F2-65A1115A27F8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>30</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical synthesis</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E847DD9B-2053-4BC7-97A9-4213B185C968</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0B9701E7-D17F-4963-82DA-B3926A65B50A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biological &amp; Medicinal Chem.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>02567418-12CB-462E-9092-530C6E63B359</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Biology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1820CCC5-B4C4-47E9-B81F-8F49AC606F0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Structure</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A097DA61-EABD-4142-9025-D4EA5CA63082</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Co-ordination Chemistry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>561091A1-9FC9-4508-B1B2-2F3623E1FC9D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Materials Characterisation</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
