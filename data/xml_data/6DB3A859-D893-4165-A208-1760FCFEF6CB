One of the most feared complications is cardiovascular disease such as high blood pressure, or blocked arteries (atherosclerosis). This not only severely affects the quality of life of the sufferer and their family, but also impacts on wider society through the financial burden of both healthcare and benefits. More than 3.2 million people in the UK have diabetes and this number is expected to double by 2035. A further 630,000 people are unaware they have this disease. Treating this diabetes costs the NHS &amp;pound;14 billion per year (10% of the NHS budget) and of this, 79% is needed to treat the diabetic complications alone. At present there are no drugs for treating diabetic complications and there is a great interest in finding drugs for this purpose. 
 
One of the first steps in the development of diabetic complications is damage to the cells which form a protective layer around the blood vessels (the endothelial cells or EC). These cells sit on top of the muscles which control whether a blood vessel tightens (constricts) or relaxes. In diabetes too much blood sugar (hyperglycaemia) causes mitochondria, a tiny but vital component the EC (and all cells) which controls energy metabolism, to stop working. Instead of using oxygen to efficiently convert sugar into 'energy', damaged mitochondria generate toxic oxygen metabolites called 'free radicals'. As a result, EC do not respond to normal body signals which tell the blood vessel to relax. Instead, they respond better to body signals which tell the blood vessels to constrict. This results in high blood pressure. In addition, the damage caused attracts inflammatory cells, which accumulate, and stick to the damaged part of the blood vessel. Eventually the blood vessel becomes so 'clogged up' that it severely restricts, and can stop, blood flowing through the vessel. When this happens i the blood vessels around the heart it can cause a heart attack (and death) and if this happens in the blood vessels of the eye, it can cause blindness. 

We have previously found that blood levels of the gas hydrogen sulfide (H2S) area lot lower in people with diabetes than in healthy people. We, and others, have also seen this in several animal models of diabetes. H2S is made in very small amounts by the EC lining blood vessels and it helps the blood vessels to relax. Lower blood H2S levels in people (and animals) with diabetes are linked to higher blood pressure, poorer circulation and poorer control of blood sugar and insulin. H2S also protects mitochondria from the damaging effects of hyperglycaemia and the effects of toxic products (e.g. 'free radicals') that are formed in the blood during hyperglycaemia. Removing H2S damages blood vessels and worsens the damage to mitochondria, EC and blood vessels. To restore the H2S that is lost during diabetes we have developed a brand new class of potential drug molecules which make very low amounts of H2S and deliver the H2S to mitochondria where it appears to be most needed. We have called these new molecules, which we have patented, 'mitochondria-targeted H2S donors' (mtH2SD). Our preliminary studies have shown that very low doses of these molecules can protect mitochondria in EC from the detrimental effects of hyperglycaemia and dilate blood vessels.

This study will firstly investigate how mtH2SD protect isolated EC from hyperglycaemia and then examine whether they can reverse hyperglycaemia-induced damage to these cells using blood vessels obtained from control and diabetic animals treated with the mtH2SD. Our team has extensive experience in H2S biology and our combined experience will ensure that this project provides reliable results that will inform clinicians, the pharmaceutical industry, scientists and most importantly patients on the therapeutic potential of mtH2SD in treating diabetic complications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will examine whether our novel mitochondria-targeted H2S donors (mtH2SD) can be used to treat diabetic endothelial dysfunction. Diabetic angiopathy is characterised by an inability of the vascular endothelium to respond to endogenous vasodilators caused by hyperglycaemia (HG), oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and endothelial damage. Thus, interventions to prevent/reverse endothelial damage caused by diabetic insult could offer a novel treatment option for diabetic angiopathies. Our previous data suggest that therapeutic administration mtH2SD (e.g. AP39 and AP123) may fulfil this role; we showed a significant loss of plasma H2S in diabetes (animals and humans) which was associated with vascular dysfunction and importantly have shown that AP39/AP123 prevents hyperglycaemia-associated metabolic changes and toxicity to the endothelium. Thus, we will firstly synthesise esterase-resistant derivatives of AP39 and AP123 and determine the pathways by which they generate H2S. We will next examine, using cellular and animal vessels, the mechanisms by which mtH2SD protect the endothelium from diabetes-associated degradation and their in vivo therapeutic potential. We will then use cultured vascular endothelial cells and examine the effects of mtH2SD on detrimental HG-induced cellular signalling and determine whether mtH2SD can reverse endothelial damage in vivo by using isolated blood vessels from in diabetic mice treated with (and without) mtH2SD.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our research has the potential to lead to the development of a new treatment for life-altering complication of diabetes that currently has only limited and expensive therapeutic options. Thus, this work may have a positive impact on a number of important beneficiaries expanded on below. Briefly: (1) Patients with diabetes; (2) Healthcare professionals; (3) NHS; (4) Pharmaceutical industry; (5) Wider scientific community (6) Researcher working on the project; (7) Society; (8) Public engagement; (9) Local economy.

(1) Importantly, in the longer term this work should benefit sufferers of diabetes and their families. Vascular complications associated with diabetic endothelial dysfunction (e.g. atherosclerosis, retinopathy etc) are highly feared and have significant impact on the quality of life and psychological welfare of sufferers and their families. 
(2)Healthcare professionals including physicians, diabetes specialist nurses and ophthalmologists will benefit from increased patient satisfaction and greater patient confidence since current therapies for diabetic angiopathy are limited.
(3)The NHS: Current therapies are expensive and limited. The cost of therapy could be significantly reduced since H2S donors are relatively cheap and easy to produce. The development of a new therapy may also alter the way diabetic angiopathies are managed. For example, if progression of atherosclerosis can be prevented or slowed then routine screening of individuals with diabetes could be less frequent, reducing screening costs.
(4)Pharmaceutical industry - a widely used therapy to halt the progression of diabetic angiopathy could generate considerable income for the pharmaceutical industry and may also generate interest in the therapeutic use of mitochondria-targeted H2S donors (mtH2SD) in other common conditions.
(5)The wider scientific community in the field of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, H2S biology and general pharmacology: This project will improve understanding of the mechanisms involved in the development and progression of diabetic endothelial dysfunction and a greater understanding of the biological function of H2S and, in particular, the effects of targeting H2S to mitochondria. In the short term, this project will also have an impact on the scientific community through the advancement of methods to study the expanding field of H2S biology and pharmacology i.e. mtH2SD. We have a track record of providing these, and other slow release H2S donors, free of charge to national and international collaborators in a diverse range of projects through the EU COST network on gasotransmitters.
(6)The researchers undertaking the project: The project involves a wide range of scientific techniques (e.g. in vitro and ex vivo, chemistry etc) in a rapidly growing and highly topical area of research. It will provide extensive and highly competitive training and experience and thus progress personal development and future employability. 
(7)Society: Diabetes affects more than 3.2 million people in the UK with 79% of the &amp;pound;14 billion/year spent by the NHS on treating diabetes going on vascular diabetic complications. This represents a significant cost to society in terms of time off work as the disease progresses, disability allowance, caring for individuals (e.g. healthcare services and family). Additionally, sufferers can experience depression and anxiety and the cost of treating these associated conditions would be reduced.
(8) Public engagement with science: The potential to develop a new therapy for a debilitating and feared disease will engage public interest and raise awareness of the researchers themselves, UoE and the MRC.
(9) Our mtH2SD may be translated in the mid-to-long term into therapeutic entities and generate patentable or commercially exploitable tools which will benefit the local economy. We currently have four patent applications on our H2S donors (WPO/GB2011/00143, GB1117095.8,. WO2013045951 &amp;amp; GB1409792.7).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-07-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>366563</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>Novel mitochondria-targeted hydrogen sulfide donors for use in a variety of pathologies where mitochondrial protection is required and where endogenous hydrogen sulfide bioavailability is impaired.
