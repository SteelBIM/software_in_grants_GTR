resistance</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M027333/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing challenge, not only in the context of healthcare but also in, for example, food safety and agriculture. The prevalence of resistant bugs such as MRSA has received widespread media coverage and the problems relating to resistance are now more widely recognised than ever before, as is the importance of developing new approaches, particularly given the increase in issues associated with multidrug resistant species. The current proposal seeks to drawn on wide-ranging applicable expertise in engineering and the physical sciences that, in collaboration with biological-science researchers, clinicians and industry, offers hitherto unexploited opportunities to contribute significantly to addressing these very significant challenges.

We shall accordingly deliver a programme of activities that promotes new interdisciplinary collaborations across traditional boundaries between engineering, the physical sciences and the biological sciences. The University of Nottingham has an outstanding history of such discipline-bridging activities, as well as of research relevant to AMR, and will bring this experience to bear upon the challenge of AMR. 

The primary mechanism for promoting new research collaborations will be that of themed Sandpits, building on the success of the Mathematics-in-Medicine Study Groups pioneered by the University in 2000 (and subsequently spawning the Mathematics-in-the-Plant-Sciences Study Groups and others). In these, presenters from the biological sciences, clinical medicine or industry will describe issues that could benefit from new approaches drawn from engineering and the physical sciences; intensive brain-storming work on these topics will identify the skills needed and establish the relevant cross-disciplinary teams; seed funding will then be provided for the most promising projects identified. While the process is now well-established, the outcomes of such workshops are very far from predictable and the aggregation of the range of disciplines outlined above should ensure that innovative approaches come to the fore. Other mechanisms will include Challenge Days (modifying the successful approach of the Industry Challenge Days held by the Business School to ensure that research developments align with the needs of potential end users), discipline-hopping secondments, speed-networking sessions, cross-disciplinary workshops (focussing on specific methodologies, to enhance further the opportunities for identifying potential crossovers between research fields) and annual showcases in the form of a launch event and a concluding 'forward-look' workshop. These activities will be augmented by a Visiting-Scholar programme whereby leading experts in complementary areas will contribute their expertise to the initiative.

Funding from the programme will be assigned in competition to multidisciplinary projects judged on their research excellence and their capacity to contribute to addressing AMR challenges. The programme's Strategy Group will be responsible for assessing applications and for monitoring progress; the activities outlined above are specifically designed (in particular by bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines) to ensure that the research ideas developed are highly innovative and that the associated projects have the required mix of research expertise. The programme will be very explicitly outward-facing, drawing extensively on input from clinicians, industrialists and other potential end users, as well as interacting with complementary research elsewhere. In combination with the excellence and innovation of the research developed, such collaborations will ensure the sustainability of the initiative.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work in this programme, and that subsequently pursued as a consequence of the developments that it enables, have the scope to impact in numerous contexts, including in advancing diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of clinicians, in improved understanding of environmental factors, in associated developments of interest to a range of industries and in a greater public awareness of factors that contribute to antimicrobial resistance (particularly in perhaps less understood areas such as overuse in farming practices). Such impacts will produce a variety of benefits.

1. Economic benefits - for example to the pharmaceutical industry with respect to improved treatments (for example in new targets, better understanding of the pathways, improved delivery), to medical-device companies (such as through developing improved antimicrobial coatings for medical devices) and to the farming industry (notably in terms of improved procedures for disposal and decreased reliance on antibiotics for livestock feed).

2. Social benefits - any advances in tackling the AMR challenge would have positive effects on society, in particular education over misuse and disposal of antibiotics and on key issues that are less publicised such as understanding the importance of the setting (environmental factors).

3. Health benefits - better diagnostics would allow the more rapid detection and appropriate treatment of antimicrobial-resistant infections and the development of better understanding would lead to more effective treatments, as well as ones less likely to increase the spread of resistance. Such impacts will be of benefit not just to human health: there are broader implications for animal health that should be enhanced through work with the School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, with the University Farm and with water companies and other organisations involved in waste disposal.

4. Environmental benefits - improvements in the disposal of antibiotics and in the treatment of water and waste post-disposal would bring about a number of environmental benefits, for example in water cleanliness and soil quality. Decreasing reliance on antibiotics in livestock farming would also contribute to a healthier environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>491232</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of KwaZulu-Natal</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>AMR in the environment</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5686CB5-0C97-440A-A55F-FCDFC031147E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary - Mathematics, Biosciences, Vet Sci, Environmental microbiology.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing of unpublished results, collaboration on Nottingham projects and joint grant applications being composed to external funders.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Visiting scholars (see events entries) and ongoing collaborations on projects such as &amp;quot;geospatial modelling the spread of AMR in the environment&amp;quot;.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Poznan University of Medical Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Poland, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Assessment of a polymer-based nanoparticulate system to enhance drug delivery of lactoferrin to prevent C. difficile infection</gtr:description><gtr:id>E71F92CC-08A6-4DBB-8B18-47C0FBFB185C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See above.

Different types of lactoferrin-polymer formulations are being tested and validated in batch cultures and the most appropriate formulation chosen for future testing. This will allow researchers to control and target the delivery of this therapeutic protein for the potential future treatment of C. difficile.

We are now working beyond the original proof of concept with the Hannan Stem cell lab at CBS to evaluate antimicrobial, cytoprotective and the anti-inflammatory potential of novel lactoferrin microgels in 3D human intestinal organoids modelling C. difficile infection and Crohn's disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Assessment of a polymer-based nanoparticulate system to enhance drug delivery of lactoferrin to prevent C. difficile infection</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/groups/bridging/impact/drug-delivery-to-prevent-c.-difficile.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M027333/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E48C802F-8897-4353-910A-09D09331BB82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical science &amp; disease</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
