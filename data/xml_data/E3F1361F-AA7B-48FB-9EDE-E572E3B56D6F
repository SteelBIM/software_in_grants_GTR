efficacy of preventive therapy in child and adolescent contacts of MDR-TB</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M007340/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Context of research: To become sick with tuberculosis (TB), someone must first be exposed to someone who is coughing, become infected and then develop the disease. People with HIV and young children are more likely to develop TB disease once they are infected. One way to prevent TB is to find the people who live in a home with someone who has TB, check them and treat those with TB infection. This will prevent them from getting sick with TB disease. Many studies have shown that a drug called isoniazid (INH) reduces the risk of developing TB when given after being coughed on, so World Health Organization (WHO) advises giving INH to HIV-infected people and children under age 6 for six months when they have contact with someone with TB.

Right now it is unclear what medicine we should give a child who has been exposed to someone with multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB, when the germ is resistant to the most commonly used TB medicines, like INH. MDR-TB is becoming more common. The WHO estimated that there were more than half a million cases worldwide in 2012. Worldwide, it is estimated that at least a million children are exposed to MDR-TB every year. With new tests to diagnose TB quickly that can also detect resistance to the common TB medicines, the number of adults who are diagnosed with MDR-TB cases is increasing. In turn, the number of children exposed to MDR-TB is also increasing. 

Treating children who become sick with MDR-TB takes a long time (usually 18 months), usually needs a hospital stay, has medicines that may have many side effects, and is expensive. For these reasons, preventing MDR-TB in children is therefore very important.

Until now, there have been no big and well designed studies to help us decide if using medicine to prevent a child with contact with someone with MDR-TB from becoming sick works. A few studies where doctors treated patients who have been in contact with MDR-TB have been done, but, each of them had problems. We think medicine to prevent MDR-TB might work, but a better type of study, a randomised control trial, needs to be done to prove that it works before we can be sure.
Aims and objectives: We want to do a study in South Africa that looks at people living in the homes of someone with MDR TB disease. We will use a drug that doctors already use to treat MDR-TB called levofloxacin (LFX). We will test whether this medicine, given every day for 6 months, can prevent children from getting TB and/or dying. We will include children who live with someone with MDR-TB in the study. Children who get the medicine will be compared to those who get a sugar pill or placebo. This sugar pill looks like LFX but has no active medicine. Children will be followed for 24 months to make sure they do not get TB or have any side effects. We will also check if the medicine was easy to take, if it was safe, or if the TB became resistant to the LFX. We will also check how expensive it is to give this kind of medicine in the way that we think it should be given. Some children and their families will be asked to talk about their experience of the study and the medicine with the clinic staff.
Potential applications and benefits: Until doctors learn what treatments work for preventing MDR-TB in children, it will hard to tell families what to do. If the medicine we are testing works to prevent MDR-TB, and is safe, and acceptable to families, we will be able to tell other doctors how to decrease MDR-TB all over the world. TB programmes will also benefit from this research because fewer children will get a disease which is costly to treat. Most importantly, if this medicine works, this study could greatly benefit children exposed to MDR-TB.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Overview: TB-CHAMP is a multi-centre, phase III double blinded, parallel group, placebo-controlled cluster randomised superiority trial of levofloxacin (LFX) for the treatment of high-risk HIV-infected and -uninfected child and adolescent household contacts of adult MDR-TB cases. 
Objectives: The trial will address the following questions: Is LFX (intervention arm), given daily for 6 months, effective in the prevention of MDR-TB and/or all-cause mortality in high-risk child and adolescent household contacts of MDR-TB cases? Other questions are: a) Does LFX have acceptable toxicity and tolerability in children? b) Is adherence similar between the study arms? c) Is there an increase in LFX resistance in children on LFX developing incident TB? d) Is LFX prophylaxis for child and adolescent contacts of MDR-TB cases cost-effective and acceptable? 
Design: The trial will be community-based using a household contact tracing strategy. Children will be randomised to: 1) LFX (~15-20 mg/kg, maximum 750mg), once daily 7 days/week or 2) LFX placebo, once daily, 7 days/week. Drug will be given as scored dispersible tablets, dosed using weight-bands. The trial will include 24 months of enrolment, and 24 months of study follow-up (total duration 48 months). Children will be screened for TB at entry and excluded if diseased. Children with the highest risk of progression to TB will be enrolled. 
Outcomes: The primary outcome is incident TB disease or death due to any cause by 24 months post-randomisation. Secondary outcome measures include: Adverse events equal or greater than grade 3; Adherence over 6 months; TB-disease free survival over 12 months; TB-disease over 24 months; Incidence of LFX resistance in children developing incident TB; Cost-effectiveness of the LFX regimen; Acceptability of the LFX regimen. Nested economic and qualitative feasibility studies will evaluate the cost, impact and acceptability of the preventive strategy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research and how? Results will benefit national and international TB programmes, the WHO, the Global Drug Facility and Fund, NGOs, and most importantly, high-risk child contacts of MDR-TB: young children, children &amp;amp; adolescents with HIV infection, and their families. 
Policymakers: The lack of evidence on MDR-TB preventive therapy makes it difficult to develop evidence-based guidelines, leading to 'recommendations' based on opinion only. If proven to be efficacious, safe, cost-effective, and acceptable to families and the NTP, we anticipate that this trial will inform global guidelines for post-exposure preventive therapy in child and adolescent contacts of MDR-TB. With secondary end points evaluating TB disease free survival over 12 months, we will demonstrate how much MDR-TB disease can be prevented with shorter follow-up. This will further reduce the cost of MDR-TB prevention than the current WHO-recommended 24 months follow-up. 
Ministries of Health and TB programmes: Given the difficulties in treatment, including frequent toxicities, prolonged hospitalizations and high cost to health systems, the successful implementation of MDR-TB prevention in children is likely to be highly cost-effective. If we show that the preventive therapy regimen averts the development of MDR-TB disease in children following exposure, it will dramatically reduce the current costs of treating children. It will also reduce the number of health centre visits required, the number of investigations conducted and will limit the expensive (and long-term) complications of MDR-TB disease and its treatment, including serious and often irreversible toxicities such as hearing loss (occurring in up to 20% children) due to injectable drugs.
Program implementation: We plan to include qualitative research to address questions regarding healthcare workers' perception of our MDR-TB preventive treatment strategy. The use of simple weight band tables for the trial will simplify paediatric MDR-TB prevention, and make it easier for healthcare workers to provide the correct drug dosages to children. 
MDR-TB-exposed children and their caregivers: Globally, a million children are potentially exposed to MDR-TB each year. Young and HIV-infected children are at high risk of progressing to disease following exposure to M.tb. While treatment outcomes for children with MDR-TB are good with individualised therapy, the treatment is long and frequently causes significant adverse events. We will assess families' and children's perspectives of the MDR-TB preventive therapy and will investigate adherence and acceptability of drug formulations in children and their caregivers.
Communities where the incidence of MDR-TB is high: If it is found that MDR-TB in children and vulnerable adolescents can be prevented by an already available, safe and affordable TB drug, the limited financial and human resources used to manage children with MDR-TB could efficiently used to treat patients with other TB conditions. Within the communities that the trial will be conducted there will be significant capacity building due to improved infrastructure, health systems and staff training.
Pharmaceutical companies: If successful, we anticipate widespread support for the development and use of a paediatric LFX formulation for MDR-TB prevention and treatment. The timing of these benefits will depend on WHO and NTPs treatment guidelines revisions. The involvement of WHO and the South African NTP in the trial is anticipated to increase the speed of uptake.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2544020</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We have, in partnership with local community groups, developed a study logo for TB-CHAMP.

A full investigational medicinal product dossier has been developed by McCleods for MCC submission in South Africa. 20% of the total drug development costs has been transferred as per mutual agreement and packaging, labelling and import is being finalized. This is the first ever paediatric dispersible tablet developed. It is envisaged that data from our trial will support in-country drug registration and eventually, marketing and wide -spread access. The first batch of study product will be delivered prior to trial startup.

Also see above for the additional 250 mg formulation and matching placebo, which is already available. Product labelling is much simpler for this formulation (tablets in a plastic container) compared to the paediatric formulation, which comes in blister packs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have established a strategic partnership with an Indian generic drug company, McCleods, to develop a paediatric levofloxacin formulation (and matching placebo) for child participants in TB-CHAMP. A formal contract was finalised between Stellenbosch University and McCleods in 2015. This strategic collaboration was facilitated by TB Alliance, through its close partnership with DTTC. 
Specifications for the formulation, based on our pharmacokinetic research, and modelling work were established and the research team worked intensively to inform the development of the new formulation and guide regulatory dossiers required for in-country regulatory submissions in South Africa (South African Medicines Control Council; MCC) and local ethics committees.

Update for most recent reporting period:
Study product and drug shipment 
Study product of the active 100 mg paediatric levofloxacin formulation is on site and is currently being evaluated in the PK lead in study. We are awaiting shipment of the 100 mg placebo formulation from India. We in addition have also secured an adult 250 mg levofloxacin formulation from McCleods, with matching placebo, in order to accommodate older children who may prefer the adult tablet to higher number of paediatric dispersible formulation. As a contingency plan, if McCleods fails to deliver on the paediatric 100 mg placebo formulation on time, the trial will open with the 250 mg levofloxacin (currently used routinely to treated MDR-TB disease in children in South Africa), and we will include the paediatric formulation later, as it becomes available. The contract to McCleods is milestone driven and further disbursement of funds is dependent on delivery of acceptable trial product and matching placebo. The pharmacy plan will be finalised in March 2017, based on the above considerations.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scientific presentation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A4D963F-ACFD-4764-88EA-927B85BFDDFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A.

The CAB meets monthly to consult on study design operationalisation and to receive study updates in an oversight capacity- among other business. The TB-CHAMP trial protocol as well as formative/feasibility evaluation plan was presented. Routine consultation is ongoing. 
The CAB supported the intent and implementation plan for the trial. Further, the CAB provided useful insight into how to explain conceptually complex concepts such as prophylaxis, drug resistance, and placebo in language that is locally appropriate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>5000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>ZAR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>South Africa</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_ZA</gtr:currLang><gtr:department>Medical Research Council of South Africa (MRC)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Strategic Health Innovation Partnerships (SHIP)</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Government of South Africa</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>78183048-7541-492A-B418-F976C9B0105F</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in WHO MDR-TB guideline meeting</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C99D327D-F108-4B62-A4ED-87589F2BA9E2</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.who.int</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Post-exposure management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis contacts: evidence-based recommendations.

We are also conducting in-depth palatability and acceptability work, and are planning on supporting an additional Masters degree student from the DTTC social science team, Lelethu Busakwe, to conduct in-depth qualitative work. 

Rationale and description
The lack of child-friendly formulations of anti-TB medications has been a major barrier to both clinical care and research in prevention of TB in children. In order to address this challenge for TB CHAMP, a child-friendly, taste-masked and dispersible 100mg levofloxacin formulation was developed by Macleod's Pharmaceuticals Ltdm and supported by the trial. The pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin in children receiving prevention or treatment for drug-resistant TB have been evaluated in in an observational study (MDRPK1, PI Hesseling) in Cape Town, South Africa, using existing adult tablet 250 mg tablet formulations. Formal analyses has been completed and a population PK model has been developed with Dr. Paolo Denti, UCT. However, witht he exception of the adult bio-equivalence study done in India in 12 healthy adult volunteers, there is not data available on the novel levofloxacin formulation developed for this trial in children 0-5 years, our trial population. Thus we have begun an intensive pharmacokinetics and safety study of the 100mg dispersible levofloxacin trial formulation in the TB CHAMP target population, before randomisation stars, in order to ensure appropriate weight-banded dosing and exposures of levofloxacin in children in our trial. Data from this PK lead-in study will be compared to data we have on n=106 children aged 0-7 years, from our observational paediatric MDR PK 1 study (NIH-funded), using the 250 mg adult tablet formulation. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the novel 100 mg paediatric levofloxacin scored tablets (Macleod's Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) in children 0-5 years of age, and to assess palatability and acceptability of this formulation in children and their caregivers

Methods
24 children (household contacts of an adult with MDR TB, as per main TB-CHAMP trial eligibility criteria) are enrolled, in representative age strata, with enrichment in younger ages (0-2 years, where most variability is typically observed for TB drug exposures). The study opened in January 2017. Children are given the trial levofloxacin trial formulation for 7 days and discontinue the trial formulation after completion of PK sampling, and are then referred for routine local standard of care tour specialist paediatric MDR-TB clinic at Tygberberg Hospital. Children are receiving the levofloxacin 100mg dispersible tablet trial formulation once-daily at the weight-banded doses proposed for the main trial. Children undergoing PK sampling at steady state, using a semi-intensive sampling approach incljding 6 samples over 12 hours. 

Drug assays are completed (1 single batch) at the University of Cape Town, Division of Clinical Pharmacology. Pharmacometric modeling will be completed by Dr. Paolo Denti, University of Cape Town, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacometric Research group, building on the existing levofloxacin population PK model (manuscript in preparation). The palatability and acceptability of the formulation (to both children and caregivers) is being studied by a Social Science team, led by Graeme Hoddinott, using questionnaires as well as unstructured in-depth interviews. 

There have been no serious or related drug adverse events this far; accrual will be completed in March/April 2017.

Limited data on its PK is available in children. The aim of this study is to characterise levofloxacin PK in children to optimise dosing.

Methods: We developed a model in collaboration with the University of Cape Town Clinical Pharmacology Division (Paolo Denti, Helen McIlleron). In brief, 109 South African children, median age 2.1 years (range 0.3-8.7) and weight 12 kg (6-22), received daily levofloxacin within a study on MDR-TB treatment/prophylaxis. Samples were collected before dosing and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-dose. Children received 15 or 20 mg/kg, with exact dosing on the day of PK sampling. Smaller children received crushed tablets, often using a nasogastric tube. NONMEM 7.3 with FOCE-I was used to interpret the PK data. The effect of body size was captured with allometric scaling [1], while the effect of age, HIV status, treatment vs. prophylaxis, and drug administration procedure were evaluated. Simulations from the final model were used to optimise doses across different weight bands, targeting adult exposure.

Results
Levofloxacin followed 2-compartment kinetics with 1st-order elimination and absorption through transit compartments [2]. After inclusion of allometric scaling, which substantially improved the fit, the model could characterise age-driven maturation of CL with an effect reaching 50% around 2 months after birth. CL in a 12 kg, 2-year-old child was estimated 4.7 L/h. The use of nasogastric tube increased the rate of absorption, but no significant effect on bioavailability could be detected. HIV positive children were found to have 16% slower CL. Levofloxacin exposures in this cohort of children were significantly lower than previously reported in adults dosed 1000 mg daily (a similar mg/kg dose): 45 vs. 129 mg?h/L [3]. Only part of this difference could be explained by allometric scaling. To achieve exposures similar to adults a dose of 50 mg/kg would be required, with smaller children receiving higher mg/kg doses, except very young children with immature CL (&amp;lt;1 year old).

Conclusion
Consistent with reports in other paediatric populations [4], children achieve levofloxacin exposures considerably lower than adults using the same mg/kg dose, and this difference cannot be fully explained by allometric scaling. Our report of slightly higher exposure in HIV positive children would need further investigation in other studies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E864C6BF-35D3-42FE-922B-0BAC71E35F9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This model has informed the dose selection of levofloxacin for our trial and has already informed ongoing other clinical research and care.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Pharmacometric model to inform paediatric levofloxacin dosing in children for MDR-TB prevention</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>All case report forms (CRFs) and data capturing tools and other study documentation have been developed by the clinical team at DTTC with input from the other participating South African sites and CTU and have been transferred to MRC CTU at UCL for database development, where the CTU will be using the Cactus platform.
