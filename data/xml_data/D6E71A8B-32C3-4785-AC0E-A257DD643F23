Victorian England saw a dramatic growth in institutional spaces in which large numbers of inmates could permanently reside. From the 1830s the relief of the poor, the punishment of criminals, the treatment of the mentally and physically ill, and the education of children were all subject to increasing charitable activity and government intervention.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will examine the impact of the design, decoration and furnishing of residential institutional spaces on the experiences of their inmates. The project will focus on three case studies: lunatic asylums (as they were known to contemporaries), schools for middle-class children, and common and charitable lodging houses. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Firstly, the project will explore the role of government legislation and recommendations in fashioning institutional life, but equally important is the investigation of the limitation of this power. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Secondly, the project will assess the relationship between institutional spaces and contemporary domesticity, that is, the ideals and practices of the family home. To what extent were inmates able to achieve privacy and could the inhabitants of a nineteenth-century institution ever hope to feel &amp;quot;at home&amp;quot;?&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>229791</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We tend to imagine the Victorian home as a family affair, a place of stability and a retreat from
the outside world. And that was the ideal for the Victorians themselves. But for huge numbers
of Londoners the reality was very different. Tens of thousands made their homes in lodgings
and lodging houses, renting a room - or often just a bed - by the week or the night in a building
shared with strangers. And there were countless others who could not even scrape together
the few pennies for this and who turned to the workhouse or refuges or who slept rough in
whatever shelter they could find.

This special exhibition at the Geffrye Museum in Hoxton told the story of these 'other' London homes in the 19th and 20th
centuries, exploring the places and spaces the poor inhabited, bringing them to life through
paintings, photographs and objects, and, importantly, through the memoirs and oral histories of
the men, women and children who sought shelter in the capital.

While the poor undoubtedly struggled, Homes of the Homeless will draw on recent research to
show that they also exercised choice and agency. The exhibition considers how people fought
against the notorious workhouse system or used it to their own ends. It reveals the
excitements and camaraderie as well as the privations of living in a common lodging house.
And it looks at how the inhabitants of London's new philanthropic and municipal 'model'
lodging houses managed to make themselves 'at home.'

The exhibition ran in Spring and Summer 2015 and was co-curated by Jane Hamlett, Lesley Hoskins and Rebecca Preston with the Geffrye Museum. The ideas for the exhibition and some of the content was drawn from research conducted for the ESRC At Home in the Institution Project that Hamlett, Hoskins and Preston worked on together between 2010 and 2012.</gtr:description><gtr:id>2EBD43CF-D04A-4D37-921C-AE207EC30F5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There were 7133 visitors to the exhibition.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Homes of the Homeless: Seeking Shelter in Victorian London</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Spaces and material cultures in charitable lodging houses in London, 1840-1914</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B001AE8A-BEDD-4737-A9CC-E4C872848259</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper given at the Inhabiting Institutions Symposium, Royal Holloway University of London

London were crowded with lodgings and 

lodging houses. From well-to-do bachelors 

residing in the smarter parts of town to less 

well-off spinsters and poor families making 

do in London's shabbier districts, a range 

of lodgings emerged to cater for the many 

classes of weekly and nightly lodger in 

the city. From the mid-nineteenth century 

the common lodging-house was subject 

to increasing statutory control as social 

reformers raised concerns for the moral 

and sanitary conditions of the houses. At 

the same time, 'model' common lodging 

houses were established and controlled by 

charitable organisations, and at the end of 

the century by the London County Council. 

The session, run by Dr Jane Hamlett and 

Dr Rebecca Preston of Royal Holloway 

University of London, with contributions 

from LMA Archivists, will introduce the 

subject of lodging-house life, 1840 

--1914 through a variety of historical 

sources from LMA's rich collections.

Description of exhibition:
We tend to imagine the Victorian home as a family affair, a place of stability and a retreat from the outside world. And that was the ideal for the Victorians themselves. But for huge numbers of Londoners the reality was very different. Tens of thousands made their homes in lodgings and lodging houses, renting a room - or often just a bed - by the week or the night in a building shared with strangers. And there were countless others who could not even scrape together
the few pennies for this and who turned to the workhouse or refuges or who slept rough in whatever shelter they could find.
This special exhibition tells the story of these 'other' London homes in the 19th and 20th centuries, exploring the places and spaces the poor inhabited, bringing them to life through

The Commissioners in Lunacy, housing reformers and headmistresses shared a language of domesticity, stressing &amp;quot;comfort&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;cheerfulness&amp;quot;. In asylums, this was crucial to attempts at cure. Domesticity was supposed to civilise poor lodgers. Girls' schools drew legitimacy from domestic social practices. In contrast, headmasters emphasised that boys should not enjoy feminine comforts, but they too drew on domesticity, defining themselves against it. Institutional governing bodies had diverse aims - cure, education, reform, sanitisation and control -- but home was a common point of reference. 



The drive for domesticity led to a close attention to the material environment. Common lodging-house keepers were compelled to clean and whitewash. Model lodging-houses offered coffee- and reading-rooms, and sleeping cubicles. Rowton and LCC houses were decorated to a high standard. Asylum dayrooms and galleries, both public and private, often overflowed with ornaments and draperies. Girls' boarding-houses were decorated like middle-class homes, but were also modelled on the public schools whose power they sought to appropriate. In contrast, boys' houses were sparsely furnished, with sporting trophies and portraits, emphasising their collective, institutional nature. 



How successfully domesticity transferred to inhabitants is questionable. Attempts to create home-like material worlds often failed. Institutions might not deliver - some asylums were badly managed, and many common lodging-houses evaded inspection. Inmates might damage institutional d&amp;eacute;cor, or they might ignore their surroundings. Some asylum patients did feel comforted, and were grateful. But others were too unwell, or disturbed, to engage with the environment. Lodgers were often indifferent to d&amp;eacute;cor, instead defining home through duration of stay and their relationships with other inmates. Schoolboys were the most at home, often creating almost fanatical material traditions.



The material world was an essential part of the operation of institutional power. Surveillance, as outlined by Foucault, was present in all the institutions surveyed, but it differed in meaning and consequences. In asylums, close surveillance was as much about patient safety as discipline. Lodgers in LCC houses recognised that surveillance was sometimes in their collective interests. Boarding-school girls come closest to Foucault's theory, as teachers, struggling to discipline without corporal punishment, constantly watched them. Dormitories had viewing holes for passing headmistresses. In contrast, a sharp line was drawn in boys' houses between pupil space and the 'private side of the house', leaving boys to discipline themselves.



However, inmates also used the material world to exercise agency. Older schoolboys and some patients had their own rooms. Boys decorated their studies, and the ability to quickly domesticate, proved useful later, in chambers, barracks and the colonies. Others had to resort to smaller strategies. Female patients could find satisfaction in their needlework. Inmates created meaning through shared material cultures. Schoolboys and lodgers pooled food and drink - small hospitalities challenging the limits of institutional provision. Material jokes (e.g. apple-pie beds) were common to both. However limited an individual's control, the material world was almost always open to small acts of self-fashioning.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7ED85882-E279-4AAB-902D-B7FE801EA0E4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B152AAF6-EEB2-45C7-B722-F9A903031683"><gtr:id>B152AAF6-EEB2-45C7-B722-F9A903031683</gtr:id><gtr:title>Residential Institutions in Britain, 1725-1970: Inmates and Environments</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be78669297ca409beaad61833054b057"><gtr:id>be78669297ca409beaad61833054b057</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamlett Jane</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781848933668</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/122C9307-2CE6-43CD-A6E2-2B1B1F4DA3EA"><gtr:id>122C9307-2CE6-43CD-A6E2-2B1B1F4DA3EA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Residential Institutions in Britain, 1725-1970: Inmates and Environments</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c094916aef2736efe4488a5d21bba251"><gtr:id>c094916aef2736efe4488a5d21bba251</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamlett, J. and Preston, R.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781848933668</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CE1E453D-33D1-450E-A4C8-D325562BB4F5"><gtr:id>CE1E453D-33D1-450E-A4C8-D325562BB4F5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Childhood, Youth and Emotions in Modern History</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82833de1e0fdd9c851ea9ba70ed2d463"><gtr:id>82833de1e0fdd9c851ea9ba70ed2d463</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hamlett J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F3893F64-F0C0-469B-ADE6-CE917D25F006"><gtr:id>F3893F64-F0C0-469B-ADE6-CE917D25F006</gtr:id><gtr:title>Comfort in Small Things?
