In nuclear research: investigations into the behaviour of materials used in current and near-term nuclear fission reactors to understand how they will perform both within their intended lifetimes and also during deviations from normal conditions; for future fission (GenIV) and fusion (both magnetic and inertial confinement) reactors, the focus is shifted towards the development of novel materials systems capable of performing in these extreme environments; also the quest for materials solutions for the immobilisation of long-lived radioactive waste. For nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing, semiconductor processing and the modification of materials (properties, structures and surfaces), ion beams are an important tool and TEM with in situ irradiation is an ideal method to explore ion-solid interactions to develop new technologies and materials processing techniques. Finally the study of the effects of radiation exposure in extra-terrestrial environments, on communication satellites or even manned craft operating outside the Earth's protective magnetic field, such as those heading to Mars.

The construction of MIAMI-2 will firstly ensure that the capabilities of the original MIAMI facility are maintained for the forseeable future enabling the continued investigation of these materials. Secondly the enhanced capabilities of MIAMI-2 will allow for the investigation of a greater range of extreme environments in a much more detailed manner. Specifically, the proposed configuration of new TEM, will enable MIAMI-2 to access a higher level of information including the changes in composition, chemical bonding and electronic structure, as well as to capture microstructural changes at higher resolutions (both temporal and spatial). It will also permit the use of thicker (more &amp;quot;bulk-like&amp;quot; specimens) and permit radiation damage studies in reactive gaseous environments.

This facility would become one of only two in the world with these capabilities, the other being in the USA at Sandia National Labs. This would ensure that the UK would maintain its position as one of the leaders in the field of radiation damage and lead to the next generation of advanced materials. 

The extreme environment range nano-mechanical and nano-tribology platform (E2N2) will be unique facility at a national and international level which will allow the measurement of material properties under &amp;quot;in-service&amp;quot; environments. The proposed instrument will include: indentation, scratch, impact, fretting and friction in the range of working loads from mN to tens of Newtons and in an extreme temperature range (-30 to 1000 C); measurements in vacuum, partial pressure, in-service, predefined and precisely monitored environment; in situ optical and AFM surface/indent observation/measuring system. The platform will generate data for a broad temperature range and on the nanoscale a combination which is not otherwise available.

It brings together research activities at Huddersfield in Advanced Materials, Railway and Turbocharger Engineering, Precision Metrology, healthcare and archaeology. The instrument will be extensively used in development of new self-healing materials and coating multilayers with nanostructures for extreme environments such us high temperature protection, friction and erosion. The ability to measure under &amp;quot;in-service&amp;quot; environments will also permit research in recreational medicine and healthcare. 

The facility will ensure that the country remains a leader in the field of nano-mechanics and will provide essential data on advanced materials and thin films for transport, energy and healthcare.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>MIAMI-2 will generate scientific results and understanding that will enable the nuclear industry to safely operate the UK's fleet of nuclear power stations. Understanding how materials perform under reactor conditions over perhaps a 60 year reactor lifetime will allow the industry and the Office for Nuclear Regulation to make decisions based on scientific evidence. This will support the safe generation of electricity in the UK from a secure low-carbon source. As well as the structural materials used in the reactors, materials used for nuclear waste disposal need to be developed and understood. A significant proportion of MIAMI-2 time will focus on nuclear glasses and glass-ceramic composites to support regulators and industry in planning disposal which will be safe for millennia.

For the future, Generation IV reactor concepts offer great gains in safety and cost. MIAMI-2 will support the contribution of the UK to these technologies laying the foundations for the domestic nuclear industry to develop these advanced reactor designs and thus concentrate economic activity in the UK. Similarly, with the global effort to realise fusion technology focused on the ITER in France, maintaining the contribution of the UK to the fundamental science will keep the UK as a centre of excellence in the fusion reactor materials field. 

As described above, wealth will be generated in the UK through support for both UK nuclear energy electricity generation and the development of new nuclear technologies. Furthermore, the creation of intellectual property and the manufacture of components for nuclear power stations can flourish if the research, development and exploitation of these technologies are supported in the UK.

Finally, MIAMI-2 will similarly contribute to knowledge and understanding in: nanostructered materials, for a multiplicity of applications; electronic materials; materials for use in space environments. The exploitation of fundamental knowledge in all these areas will help maintain the UK's scientific excellence in functional materials leading to new technological developments and thus wealth creation. 

The E2N2 facility will be a major investment for UK research in functional materials. The instrument will underpin research and engineering at the University of Huddersfield which has received in excess of &amp;pound;35M in the last 5 years and will provide the ability to test the mechanical properties of materials and coatings at high temperature and &amp;quot;in-service&amp;quot; environments which will be invaluable for the development of new nano-structured coatings, materials for car turbine technologies, high speed railway and regenerative medicine. 
It will generate scientific results and understanding which will help secure a leading position for UK enterprise and will propel the UK to future growth. Development and characterisation of new materials and nanostructured coatings for extreme environment addresses one of the most significant contemporary problems-scarceness of high performance metals. 

The equipment will directly benefit high-value manufacturing by developing high performance materials and thin film technologies, preserving valuable natural resources. It will directly contribute to the quality of life by developing and characterising materials for medical implants and medicine delivery systems. Both facilities will contribute to knowledge dissemination by publication in peer-reviewed and Open access journals. Also Open Access will be made available via the University of Huddersfield repository in accordance with EPSRC policy. 

The establishment of both the MIAMI-2 and the E2N2 platform will enable research through which PhD and early-stage postdocs will be trained to become vital assets to both academia and industry. The access arrangements outlined in the Case for Support will increase the pool of expertise relevant to both facilities enabling further applications to help solve materials challenges in diverse fields.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3547147</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop on &quot;Radiation Effects under Extreme Conditions&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9709267E-37B9-448C-BB70-858361893603</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Radiation Effects under Extreme Conditions, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia
26-28 October, 2016

This workshop focused on radiation effects in materials under extreme conditions, including extremes of nuclear and electronic energy-loss; ion-flux; ion-fluence; temperature; pressure; and target geometry (e.g. nanostructures, high aspect-ratio features). It was &amp;quot;invitation only&amp;quot; and limited around 30 participants. professor S E Donnelly talked specifically about the new MIAMI-2 facility being built with this award.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://physics.anu.edu.au/eme/radeffects/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>1000000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Mid-Range Facility</gtr:description><gtr:end>2022-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>EPSRC and CRUK</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>UKSBS PR16007</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>81F55EE7-DC20-45BF-B0FD-1253AAB00323</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Findings&amp;quot; is the wrong word.
