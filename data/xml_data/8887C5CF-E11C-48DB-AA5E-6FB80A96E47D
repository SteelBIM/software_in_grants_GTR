In particular the research will compare the rate and impact of internet-based or online forms of contact to more traditional or offline methods such as by phone and face to face in recent elections in two countries - the US and the UK. To date, there has been only limited investigation of the extent and effect of online contacting compared with other modes and much of it has been done in the US.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will extend this understanding by analysing a range of original and existing data that includes the 2012 the American National Election Study and compare it with findings from the 2010 British Election Study. The comparative element of the research will allow for an examination of the extent to which political context shapes the nature and impact of these contacts.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be of benefit to a wide range of non-academic audiences. Following the pioneering work by Gerber and Green (2000) in the U.S. in assessing the cost of individual contact per vote returned we will be able to measure the comparative benefits of traditional forms of contact versus newer web and mobile phone-based applications. By adding the UK to the analysis we will be able to assess the extent to which different techniques are more suitable and relevant to different institutional settings. Finally, by dividing both offline and online contact into more formal approaches from the party directly and informal approaches by friends and family in support of an individual candidate the research will provide important insight into the extent to campaigns benefit from employing a more non-intrusive 'bottom-up' networked strategy to spread their message, rather than a top-down more orchestrated system of message delivery. 
These findings will be delivered in a research paper that will be presented at an international workshop (organized as part of this project) on campaign mobilization in late 2013. This workshop will bring together academics and practitioners in the field. The key findings will be written up as a short report to be disseminated by Duke and Manchester University Press Offices, the PI and CI project websites and the user networks established during the ESRC Fellowships.

Key non-academic beneficiaries of the project and those targeted with the report are outlined below (more specific details and examples of organizations/groups/agencies involved are provided in the Pathways to Impact document):
(1) Parties, Unions and Non-profit organizations - particularly those involved in election or issue campaigns within these groups. 
(2) Campaign professionals - private consultants and commercial firms seeking to advise political organizations, candidates and those campaigning for changes in the social or economic arena. The research will provide rigorous cutting edge research on the best tools to exploit in the bid to capture public attention for one's cause. 
(3) A wider body of less organized individual activists outside parties and formal bodies that are interested in understanding how digital technologies can and are being used to enact political change both in the UK and elsewhere such as NetRoots. 
(4) Media and Independent/Private research organisations - the findings would be of interest to political journalists in the mainstream news media in both the US and UK as well as specialist publications for political campaigners and legislative/political staff. In addition, the findings would be of interest to independent research bodies dedicated to researching changes in democratic practice, reform and e-democracy issues such as the Hansard Society as well as Thinktanks conducting work in this area.
(5) Policy officials - Staff within national, state and local government departments, agencies and committees seeking to engage in public education programmes or those seeking to examine how falling rates of voter turnout and citizen engagement can be addressed .
More generally the research has the potential to contribute to democratic culture and society by identifying how the parties and other organizations can engage the public in politics and stimulate interest in elections. With concerns emerging since the UK election of 2001 about falling turnout rates and declines observed the past decades in the U.S., particularly among young people, these findings will be of particular importance to those who see electoral participation as an important stepping stone onto other forms of engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>22726</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Short article in ESRC Magazine Society Now</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92A95AD8-7B21-41A3-B398-C9282E6829A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article further disseminated research findings from project

The workshop is designed to examine over time trends in voter mobilization within and across countries and at both its drivers and effects. Presentations will address questions related to both formal (i.e. party) efforts and contact and that coming from informal networks, with a particular focus on the role of social media. This project is funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC).

Campaign Manager from Shelter requested my slides and an academic colleague from the University of Surrey who came specifically to hear the talk then met with me afterward to arrange a Post election digital campaign roundtable. The goal is to develop a forum that brings academics and e-campaigners and journalists together to discuss the impact of social media and other web tools on the election.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.smf.co.uk/events/chalk-talk-with-rachel-gibson-digital-campaigning-where-is-it-happening-who-does-it-reach-and-does-it-work/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Results were disseminated at the 2013 American Political Science Association's annual meeting in a very well attended panel that provided a retrospective evaluation of the 2012 Presidential election and included eminent scholars of U.S. politics. Key findings were also presented in a paper presented at a specialist academic workshop organized by the PIs in Manchester. Other international experts in the study of voter mobilization presented papers (Green, Hansen, Schmitt-Beck, Panogopoulos, Pattie, Fisher), and we developed a proposal for a special issue of Party Politics on 'Voter Mobilization in Context' which has been accepted. The papers including our own are currently under review with publication likely in 2015. Publishing our work in this special issue will maximize its scientific impact given the established reputation of the contributors. Results from the study were presented by Prof Gibson to the public at the Scottish Parliament's 2013 Festival of Politics where she joined a panel of media and campaign experts discussing the value of social media (this included Michael White of the Guardian). Findings have been publicised through blog posts for the Democratic Audit run by the LSE Public Policy Group and University of Manchester's 'Westminster Watch', and a report for the current ESRC Britain in 2014 magazine. This publication resulted in contact and ongoing email correspondence with an MP to find out further information about the study and its implications for the upcoming General Election. Key findings have also been disseminated to in the Sociology Review (Issue 4, 2015) a publication that is popular in the teaching of A level students. In 2015 the PI was invited and gave presentation to the 'Chalk &amp;amp; Talk' series of lunchtime talks run by the Social Market Foundation. The talk was well attended and the results generated significant discussion. The Head of Campaigns at Shelter requested a copy of the slides.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4A54535D-2847-441A-B795-08FF8AE78C79</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the project are five-fold:
First we confirm across two independent electoral contexts that personalized face to face contacting of voters by parties remains the 'gold standard' in terms of mobilizing turnout on election day. 
Second, we show that despite the increased attention given to online campaigning in both the UK and U.S. it has no effect on turnout. This holds true whether contact comes directly from the party or indirectly i.e. it is mediated through online social networks. This latter finding is significant in that it counters the widely publicised findings of a so-called 'Facebook effect' on turnout reported in Nature using experimental methods. 
Third, beyond turnout, there is evidence from our results to suggest that online contact may be a way for campaigns to maintain engagement among their activists.
Fourth, our study shows there has been a slight fall in rates of overall contacting in the U.S. and UK over the past decade, particularly of more personalized forms. Given that this has occurred during the period where campaigns have switched to use more online tools, this indicates e-campaigning may be becoming a substitute for traditional methods. 
Finally, despite the fall in use of more traditional methods, our results show that U.S. parties are much more likely to engage in direct online contacting than their UK counterparts. Levels of indirect online contact, i.e. political messages from friends and family about one's vote however are similar across the two countries. This discrepancy is very interesting in that it confirms that British parties lag behind their American counterparts in the use of web campaigning, but that the public at large are just as comfortable to use the new tools to interact about politics during the election. 
These findings suggest that there is a need for further analysis of the levels and impact of online contacting on turnout and other types of campaign activity in countries outside of the two cases examined here in order to assess whether they apply across different institutional contexts. We will undertake this analysis in a paper now accepted for presentation at the 2014 American Political Science Association Meeting (APSA). We will examine the same questions in at least 10 other countries that have conducted the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) module of questions on which our analysis is based and use multi-level modelling techniques to analyse the data.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from the research are useful to political parties and candidates in the U.S. and UK particularly in that they show that contacting voters through personal i.e. face to face methods remains the most important way to ensure they vote. Use of digital channels do not appear to be particularly helpful in this regard. That said, the use of web campaigning appears to be important in sustaining levels of involvement of activists and ensuring existing volunteers and members are kept involved. Also while online methods of contact may not be effective on their own, an investment by campaigners in understanding how they can be used to increase and support better offline contacting would seem to be a worthwhile step. In particular, this suggests the merits of a two-step approach to voter mobilization and disseminating the campaign message whereby digital communication and resources are used to support activists who then go on and engage in wider personalized canvassing.
The findings are also of strategic value for campaigners in political organizations more generally, i.e. third sector groups and community campaigners seeking to engage more people in a cause or issue. Based on our findings a clear recommendation is that such groups would do well to focus on how to use digital channels to support and extend their face to face and personalized forms of contacting. Online contact may be quicker and cheaper but at least based on current trends is not particularly effective.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6BBAFFB0-A4A9-4FF1-B58F-1032263D13C7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and
