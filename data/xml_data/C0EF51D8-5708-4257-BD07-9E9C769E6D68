Using participatory video research methods, the project aims to understand their experience of space and space use in the formation of 'home' and belonging.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hackney is a part of London undergoing rapid transformation with demands from competing stakeholders leading to juxtaposing expectations of space use and the potential for everyday conflict. Young people, as substantial users of public space, are immersed in debates about social inclusion, crime and media representations, inflected with intergenerational opposition and a discourse of community breakdown. Yet youth voices are often marginalised. Therefore, ChasH takes a participatory approach, explicitly focusing on youth perspectives. It will further theoretical understanding of urban affective geographies, bringing together research on young people, urban transformation and cosmopolitanism.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The community arts collaborations embedded in the project will provide skills development in film production, research and project management for the young people involved. The project will also enable an evaluation of the use of participatory video and online media and social networks in producing research data and enhancing youth participation. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries of this research include: the Peer Research Assistants; youth organisations and networks in Hackney and more widely throughout the UK; and local government authorities (e.g. Hackney Borough Council). Indirect beneficiaries include the arts community and urban planners.

Benefits of the project centre on the ESRC's 'Fair and Vibrant Society' strategic research priority, and enhancing quality of life, health and creative outputs. PRAs will benefit directly as a result of the skills development component built into the research. The youth cohort from which the PRAs will be selected are defined as 'hard to reach', from socio-economically marginalised communities based in Hackney-estates, often by-passed by mainstream local government programmes. Participation in the project will enable six to gain professional, accredited film production skills, as well as work experience including research techniques and project management. They will be fully involved with the project's collaborative practices (data production, analysis and writing), and communication activities. They will be mentored to develop the requisite skills to enable participation at each phase of the study and in the dissemination of results, presenting at the final workshop and liaising with relevant media and policy bodies. The film production company, Mouth That Roars will accredit participants under the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network (ASDAN, www.asdan.org.uk). This incorporates a process of monitoring and evaluating participants' work, giving feedback and identifying areas of practical and leadership skills development among participants. It is an aim of the project that benefits such as self-esteem will also accrue.

The project will establish from the beginning a strong commitment to community engagement and developing links with stakeholders in the Hackney community and local government sectors. It aims to be a collaboration involving academics, youth organisations and media practitioners, building and strengthening links between the university and third sector, and ensuring a bi-directional transfer of skills between academics and third sector institutions. The findings, including how young people construct and maintain a sense of belonging, will have implications for youth workers and local authorities in terms of, for example, modifying gang culture and conflict in Hackney and beyond, and developing strategies to enable young people to develop a stake in the community, working against stereotypes of dysfunction. These findings will also be of benefit to local government authorities, in particular Hackney Borough council, in terms of informing the council's youth and 'Sustainable Community' strategies. 

The PI's previous work with young people (in Sydney, the Generate project, 2000-2001, see CV; in Delhi, the CyberMohalla project, see Butcher 2009) identified the role of research projects such as the one proposed here as a means to facilitate interaction between young people and local authorities, including urban planners. As noted in the case for support, young people are one of the largest users of public space but often ignored in planning of that space. The project will therefore aim to facilitate interaction between young people and urban planners, beginning with the local council, to engender the benefits of wider community engagement in designing local space. Indirect beneficiaries will also include the arts community. Hackney is a vibrant centre for the arts and creative industries in London. In evaluating the collaborative and participatory processes in this study, it aims to showcase the potential of local young people in the arts and highlight innovative ways of generating creative output, including the use of online broadcast media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227561</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of five films produced as part of the research project</gtr:description><gtr:id>76715CE4-B495-497A-A360-1E60C8ECA2CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The films have been screened to a variety of audiences including Hackney Youth Parliament, members of Hackney council social cohesion policy team, youth groups in Hackney, Greater London Aauthority peer facilitators, a Hackney Homes 'winter warmer' consultation, as well as public screenings at Hackney Picture House, on BBC3 (Fresh, online), and online on the project's website.

The screening of the CHAsH films was followed by a Q &amp;amp; A with RA Dickens and two of the PRAs, Monet and Tyrell. The films sparked questions and debate about urban change in the area. The CHAsH films were followed by a screening of Winstan Whitter's film, Legacy in the Dust, about the Four Aces Club and Colesseum, demolished in the 2000s.

Apart from disseminating the findings of the project, the films also invoked positive responses from people including that the films were 'inspiring', that they made people feel 'proud' and 'hopeful'.

It aimed for impact in the local community, targeting local government authorities and youth networks in particular, as well as more broadly influencing debates on social cohesion, youth work and urban transformation in London and nationally. As a collaboration involving academics and youth organisations, building and strengthening links between the university and third sector, the project maintained a bi-directional transfer of skills between academics and third sector institutions. The findings, including how young people construct and maintain a sense of belonging, and interest in the process of participatory film making, have been taken up by various stakeholders, incuding local authorities, youth workers, community activists and the arts sector. This activity has particularly focused on developing strategies to enable young people to develop a stake in the community, working against stereotypes of dysfunction.

Measures of success were seen in the level of interaction with the project findings and feedback from local government, youth and community organisations, input into youth and cultural development programmes, and mainstream media coverage (noted in the outputs) that enabled the findings from the CHASH project to intervene in wider debates on gentrification and housing policy in London. Its societal impact in particular stems from two key activities: consultation with local government and input into local policy; and capacity building for the young people involved in terms of skills development. 

1. Influence on local policy:
The project maintained a strong commitment to community engagement and developing links with stakeholders in the Hackney community and local government sectors. The research has been used to inform community activism and local government consultation. The PI liaised with contacts in Hackney Council to ensure they were aware of the project and its potential to feed into their Sustainable Community Strategy. A policy officer from Hackney Council joined the CHASH advisory group, providing a conduit for the findings to reach local policy domains. A stakeholder meeting was also held in September 2013, to brief members of several council policy and planning units (youth, cohesion, urban planning), as well as representatives of the local police and a community activist organisation, on the findings of the project to date and potential uses of the data and films in raising issues of social cohesion, the impact of gentrification and youth work.

The project team, including three PRAs, provided evidence at the Hackney Council Community Safety Social Inclusion Scrutiny Commission Hearing (January 2014) and the Children and Young People Scrutiny Commission Hearing (March 2014). The first was a presentation to a select committee of Hackney councillors specifically addressing the impact of gentrification on young people. The second was a presentation to a select committee of Hackney councillors specifically addressing the use of school grounds for after-hours activities. 

PI Butcher was then invited to join a community consultation in 2014 run by the council (including local voluntary and NGO organisations) to examine the impact of urban redevelopment and demographic change in Hackney. She is now a member of the Mayor's 'Critical Challenge' advisory panel to review a major research consultation within Hackney (2015-18) and feeding into Hackney Council strategy for managing change and redevelopment in the borough. PI Butcher also took part in the public debate 'Hackney: a place for everyone?' (March 2015), discussing the future of the borough with Mayor Jules Pipe and other panellists. 

The films have been screened to various sections of Hackney Council and used to generate debate about social change. For example, Hackney Council requested the use of the films in a 'Winter Warmer' event, organised by Hackney Homes. The event was designed to elicit responses from older residents (over 55 years) about issues they face in the Borough, and the films were played on continuous loop to attract participants and to generate discussion. In general, feedback from Hackney Council has been very positive, for example, this response from a policy officer (September 2013): 

'It's everything that [the council is] trying to get our heads around, so it's really impressive that you've managed to [] articulate that so powerfully for us. So thank you, and your hard work has been noticed, and I'm really impressed.'

The project attempted to widen the scope of influence by organising a presentation of the project to the Peer Outreach Team, Greater London Authority (February 2014). This was designed to encourage the GLA's Peer Outreach Team (20+ in attendance) to discuss the project within their own youth networks and to encourage other young people to see the films and comment on them. 

Local community groups and arts organisations have also expressed a positive response to the films, such as feedback from the organisers of the Eastern Curve Community Garden, Dalston (Hackney), which featured in one of the films:

'We thought the Hackney as Home project was excellent - we really enjoyed coming along to the Russet [film screening venue] to see the films and hear some of the young people speak' (16 February 2016).

CHASH has become a case study for the 'Local Government Knowledge Navigator' website (www.lgkn.org), designed to facilitate collaboration between academics and local government. The project's participatory visual methods have also been recognised as 'best practice' by other academics and used as a case study in keynote lectures and professional development. For example, PI Butcher was invited to take part in an international webinar on participatory methods (Approaching participatory and community based research, DML Commons Professional Pathways Webinar, 29 April 2015. http://dmlcommons.net/unit-2-propath/).

PI Butcher has spoken at events aimed at arts practitioners in east London, talking about the role of creative intervention in gentrification (Peer Gallery, Hoxton, March 2015). She was also invited to speak at the Dublin Science Gallery as part of the exhibition 'Home/Sick' (co-curated by Anne Enright). This generated further requests for information and discussion over the future of cities, both in the UK and internationally.

There has been a spin off piece of research emerging through the networks established by the PI as part of the CHASH project. Hackney Unites and the Shoreditch Trust in 2014 established a community group ('Our City') to explore the impact of TechCity in south Hackney. PI Butcher was able to run an additional pilot research project for this group, highlighting the barriers and opportunities for young people to access the hi-tech industry. This involved networking with local community and businesses within the TechCity neighbourhood, and the production of a report circulated to those stakeholders (http://www.hackneyashome.co.uk/sites/default/files/documents/Open%20University%20Young%20People %27s%20Participation%20in%20Tech%20City%20March%202015.pdf). 

2. Capacity Building: 
The project offered skills development in media production, research techniques and project management for the five local, estate-based, peer research assistants (PRAs) that worked on the project. In addition to undergoing a bespoke training programme developed by the PI, the film production company, Mouth That Roars, accredited PRAs under the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation Network (ASDAN, www.asdan.org.uk). This incorporated a process of monitoring and evaluating their work, giving feedback and identifying areas of practical and leadership skills development. 

Capacity building also involved mentoring over the term of the PRA's involvement in the project (one year as casual employees) to enable them to be involved in the project's collaborative practices, communication activities and policy initiatives, including making two presentations to Hackney Council committees (noted above). PRAs presented at both an academic conference ('Making Connections', Kings College, January 2014) and public screenings of the films (September 2013, March 2015), and were invited to provide training input for a subsequent project run by Living Maps ('This is our E20'), using film to explore the new E20 Village in Stratford (May 2015). Capacity building extended to the collaborating partner, Immediate Theatre, who have gone on to use filmmaking in a project with young people on an Estate in Hackney.

Forthcoming publications will highlight the process of reflection embedded in the project that reveals ways in which the PRA's involvement impacted on how the team began to see the city and its diverse residents. For example, a serious issue in gentrifying neighbourhoods is spatial segregation between existing, marginalised residents and newcomers with more cultural and financial capital. One PRA was able to use his involvement in the project to generate moments of encounter between himself and his 'hipster' neighbours that shifted him from a position of antagonism to one in which he described Hackney as a place of 'mercy and forgiveness'. This potential to use research as a catalyst for encounter and the praxis of social cohesion will be the focus of a future funding bid. 

3. Media activity: 
Findings were translated into accessible and tailored formats for user communities and prepared for media dissemination including the local (Hackney Today and Hackney Gazette), London wide (London Live Debates, London TV), national broadcasting (Thinking Allowed, BBC Radio 4) and via blogs ('Gentrification through Young People's Eyes', British Policy and Politics Blog, LSE, July 2015). This work generated public debate, evidenced on social media such as Twitter, as well as increased requests for further information on the project. A dedicated web-presence was used for streaming media content and publications created in the research (www.hackneyashome.co.uk). While the films are available on the website they were also picked up by the BBC3 Fresh documentary series, and re-broadcast on their website (www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019xhm0), with small clips from two films later being incorporated into a montage of the best films submitted to the series and broadcast on BBC3 TV, January 2015).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>864C196E-BCCF-468A-8FDF-C0798987465F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the Creating Hackney as Home project was to work with young people in Hackney, using participatory visual research methods, to understand their experience of space and space use in the formation of 'home' (i.e. a sense of belonging), and to ascertain the influence of affective responses to change and difference in that process. The first objective was to examine the creation of 'home', in a complex, diverse, rapidly changing urban space, from a youth perspective. The second objective was to further theoretical understanding of urban affective geographies, bringing the literature on urban transformation and affect to bear on the literature of youth research and cosmopolitanism. The third objective was to collaborate with young people in participatory data production, with a capacity building element to provide skills development in film production, research and project management. And the final objective was to evaluate the use of participatory visual methods for gathering affective research data and enhancing youth participation in the research process. This was to include an evaluation of the effectiveness of forms of online youth oriented broadcast media such as YouTube. 

In order to achieve these objectives, the project focused on film production, the use of video diaries, and discussion, both online and in workshops. Working with a community partner, Immediate Theatre, five Peer Research Assistants (PRAs) , 16-18 years old, were employed in April 2013 (on a casual basis) to conduct research on the theme of 'Home' within the context of their changing borough. They were responsible for film and video diary production over the course of the following year, supported by mentoring from the research team. An initial workshop was held to discuss the study's objectives and refine research questions. PRAs undertook research around their chosen themes, also working with different genres of film (from documentary to spoken word performances) [films available online at www.hackneyashome.co.uk].

The resulting research data consisted of: material collected in the process of making the films, the films themselves, and responses to the films, which were screened online, to three groups of young people within Hackney and to other groups including youth workers and older residents of Hackney; material collected as part of the PRA's critical reflections made throughout the project, both video and written diaries; interviews and material collected by the PRAs as part of their ongoing research on Hackney (e.g. archives); material collected by the PI and RA including debriefing interviews with PRAs, meetings with stakeholders; participant observation, and thick description of particular sites within Hackney such as Dalston Junction and Broadway Market (recurring sites in the research). 

These data generated the following findings, responding to the research objectives noted above (more detail can be found in related publications, currently under review or in preparation).
 
1. How do young people from diverse backgrounds in Hackney experience and redefine 'home' and belonging under conditions of rapid urban change?
Our findings suggest there is an ambivalence towards change. Young people in the study expressed an awareness of shifts in social and cultural boundaries that have both positive and negative outcomes on them and their neighbourhood, family and friends. The speed of change was at times as problematic as the form or type of change. An underlying question was 'Who are the changes for?' as it was felt that displacement, both physical and affective, was an issue as new middle class and young creative residents moved into the area. 

2. What are the affective responses to change and difference, generated in everyday interactions with others and a transforming built environment, implicated in this defining of home?
Young people defined 'home' as: familiarity with the built environment/urban landscape; having family and friends near; and 'feeling' at home. However, the data suggests that this sense of belonging is being disrupted with urban redevelopment and gentrification. While physical displacement is evident with the demolition of social housing estates in Hackney, there are also processes of 
affective displacement taking place, in which young people no longer feel they belong. A critical mass of new residents in particular areas such as London Fields has created a sense of discomfort and tension. This was evident in young peoples' responses to interactions between residents, marked by classed and intercultural differences. However, there were small spaces of solidarity, for example, a shared love of fashion for some.

3. What are the skills and modes of adaptation that young people develop and deploy in order to feel at home, to 'manage' affective responses to difference and change, particularly when they engender conflict?
It was recognised by some of the participants in the project that there was a need to adapt to the changing context in the Borough, but this raised the contentious question of who was required to adapt and why. The young person from a working class background is expected to acquire the competencies necessary to work in new contexts such as TechCity. In terms of everyday interactions, urban competencies such as empathy, dispositions such as curiosity, humour and the re-appropriation of space were used to navigate the neighbourhood and its diverse residents. However, not all competencies were necessarily about engagement, for example, learning where and who to avoid. While there was a degree of agency in the ability of young people to critique the changes they live with, their capacity to effect change was limited by structural factors (e.g. the political economy of urban redevelopment, lack of access to points of influence).

4. How effective is the use of youth-oriented online broadcast media in generating data as well as encouraging wider participation in research processes?
The use of a participatory visual research methodology raised several important issues. The public nature of the project meant that standard ethics procedures of confidentiality were not applicable. Instead, an ethics of recognition was developed, that is, making youth voices explicitly visible as part of the aim of the project to enable them to be heard in debates on urban redevelopment. There were both benefits and challenges for working with film. The time constraints meant that at times a PRA's initial ideas had to be renegotiated. Some also expressed a sense of 'stress' at the need to coordinate the different elements of filmmaking (e.g. scripting, directing, editing) with their busy lives. However, the films have been an invaluable means of bringing the PRAs' voices to different audiences. Their 'portable' nature meant that their stories have been viewed internationally, but more importantly, by local decision makers in Hackney Council. The creation of five individual films, connected by the theme of 'home', highlighted that the category of 'youth' consists of heterogenous perspectives. However, the use of social media and online broadcast sites had only limited success in terms of disseminating the data (it did not go 'viral'). It was found that the most successful means of generating discussion about the issues raised in the films was to physically screen them to diverse audiences and facilitate a discussion. 

Findings from this study would suggest that the visual does have a unique capacity to capture the sensory experience of the city, seen in particular in two of the films (Monet and Shekeila's) where the affective is brought to the fore. However, the visual could not be separated from the audio, and text and narrative still provided an important interpretative function. 

It should be noted that in terms of the participatory process, there was a strong need for mentoring and time invested in developing and maintaining the relationships with the PRAs. The role of local partnerships (primarily with Immediate Theatre) was also crucial in creating a hub for the project within Hackney as well as generating channels for further dissemination. This has led to further work (currently in preparation for publication) on the relationship between research and youth work. 

In addition to these findings, a small pilot project was run under the auspices of CHASH, to examine the opportunites and barriers to accessing Tech City (south Hackney). This study was generated through the networks established between the PI and local community groups as a result of the CHASH project, and its findings can can be found on the website (www.hackneyashome.co.uk).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Since the production of the films in 2013, they have been, and continue to be, used in various settings (see list of Outputs). Similarly, the model of the participatory process itself has been examined for its capacity to be taken up by other researchers and practitioners (and in some instances it has been).

In terms of policy, members of the research team have appeared before Hackney Council policy committees, and the PI was invited to join a standing committee guiding the Council's strategy to manage urban change in the borough (2015). The council is also exploring ways that the participatory approach could be used to consult with young people about the changes occuring around them. 

Within the academic field, the PI and RA sit on advisory committees for other research projects working with young people in various contexts. The research has also featured as an example within an online professional development course for researchers interested in the field. A publication plan is currently being put into place with two journal articles under review, one book chapter in press, and four journal articles in preparation.
