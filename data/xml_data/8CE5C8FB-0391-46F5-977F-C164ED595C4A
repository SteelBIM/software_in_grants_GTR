(MILES).</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I000992/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Mathematical contributors to the social and life sciences typically aim to provide insight by building a model and solving it using ingenious techniques and computer programmes whose details can be inaccessible to researchers in the host discipline. Mathematicians equally can be surprised to discover that these disciplines themselves use quite different kinds of models, in unfamiliar ways to seemingly perplexing ends. Revolutionary progress comes when researchers from all the relevant disciplines create new kinds of models together, owned and exploited by them all. We plan a programme of networking, idea-generation and collaboration activities focused on modelling approaches to the life and social sciences, their synergies and dissonances. We shall explore the different types of model used in different disciplines, the extent to which the models themselves, modelling methods (ways in which models are created and validated), methodologies (the philosophy of science behind modelling) and ways of using models (e.g. for understanding or prediction) can be transferred between disciplines, and when and how to create entirely new modelling frameworks. We shall emphasise three themes of particular interest to research groups in the university, where different disciplines have distinct perspectives: 1) sustainability, 2) the 'in silico' cell, 3) mathematical and computational techniques in social science and biology. Our programme will, however, include activities across the wide span of life and social science modelling, with further occasional events on modelling in the broadest sense, to examine the opportunities for dialogue with other disciplines in the University (e.g. English, Drama, Music, Film, Psychology, Management).The University hosts several highly successful multidisciplinary centres, such as the Centre for Environmental Strategy, the Advanced Technology Institute and the Surrey Space Centre and projects including the ESRC Research Group on Lifestyles, Value and Environment and the EngD programme in Environmental Technology. We see the potential for similar successful interaction between Mathematics, Computing, and the social and life sciences. To achieve it, we must create the circumstances that encourage individuals to take part in multidisciplinary projects, by suggesting to them that to approach another discipline with curiosity but no immediate solutions is of great value, by providing opportunities to meet people from other disciplines and time to learn in detail about their perspectives, issues and interests and to develop a common language, and by offering incentives to embark on risky research adventures.Our three-year programme of activities to stimulate new collaborations in life and social science modelling will be coordinated by a dedicated full-time facilitator, and include: externally facilitated annual sandpits with research pump-priming fund prizes; discipline hopping funding for mathematicians, computer and physical scientists and engineers to spend time in life/social science departments; a monthly Caf Scientifique; multidisciplinary workshops and networking events; a visiting scholar programme; funding for feasibility studies; a virtual forum and wiki for online discussion and collaboration.Research projects conceived and developed during the programme will lead to follow-on grant applications. Owing to the strength of the contributing research groups, we expect the consequent impact on the UK cross-disciplinary research profile to be significant. Our ultimate aim is to create a sense of excitement about stepping beyond traditional subject boundaries and thinking creatively about working with a wide range of potential collaborators, so that the cultural changes initiated by this programme will be sustainable in the longer term, and cross-disciplinary research will continue to flourish at the University into the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>MILES is intended to foster new collaborations with seedcorn funding, and so we expect that the resulting research projects will be in the early stages during the lifetime of the programme. Economic impact is likely to be achieved after successful projects have obtained follow-on funding, on a time horizon of 5 to 10 years upwards, in many fields. All of society stands to benefit from research to achieve sustainable living. Specific beneficiaries might be those whose health, homes and livelihoods are threatened by climate change. In addition, economic benefit could accrue to companies in the renewable energy industry through research into microbial fuel cells, in the food industry through research into food security, and in a broad range of sectors through research into industrial symbiosis. Developers and manufacturers of safe water systems could benefit from research into safe water technologies. We will aim to involve past and present sponsors of our EngD programme in Environmental Technology in MILES through participation in workshops and research projects in order to enhance its potential economic impact. Policymakers in all sectors - local, regional and central government, voluntary agencies, charities, non-governmental organisations, trade associations, individual businesses - and in all areas from the carbon economy to health, stand to benefit from advances in complexity science that provide insight and tools to support evidence-based decision making. We have contacts with the National Industrial Symbiosis Project and Link2Energy and we will target policymakers in other areas to involve in our programme via Surrey's London Technology Network (LTN) Business Fellows. Pharmaceutical companies want to use in silico methods for more efficient drug discovery, as they are faster, more flexible, safer and cheaper than laboratory testing. Companies with whom we already have relationships (mostly UK) may benefit directly through participation in MILES events. Innovation in drug discovery will improve the efficiency of the pharmaceutical industry, and ultimately lead to improvements in public health. We shall use the LTN fellows to target key innovators in the pharmaceutical and medical sectors for participation in networking events and workshops. Modelling for medical research will yield insight into the origin of medical problems and identify targets for therapeutic intervention. Patients will benefit in the long term from improved treatments for the associated clinical conditions, as will the National Health Service that bears the cost of managing them. We shall aim to involve our contacts within hospitals, either directly in collaborative research projects, or to disseminate research findings within the clinical community. Other beneficiaries would be health economists and managers, who predict financial strategies within the healthcare sector. Research into biomimetics could lead to exploitable technologies, e.g. through Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. The Computing department's KTP partner companies in neural networks and digital ecosystems, and their international partners, could benefit from involvement of the KTP associate in MILES. The general public will be welcome as full participants in the debate at the Cafs Scientifiques. Industrial contacts and the general public will be made aware of programme outputs by direct participation in events and through our website. Industrial partners can also be involved directly in research projects. 'Study group' workshops often lead to long-term collaboration between academics and partners in the commercial sector. Training of the programme facilitator in research programme management, scientific communication and event facilitation will provide a highly skilled professional to the UK economy. Training of the programme participants in multidisciplinary scientific research will provide a valuable resource in an area of strategic importance to UK science.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>650304</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Rudolf Laban's unpublished drawings and his graphic representation of his icosahedral model in dance were used to create a performance-based and artistic response. This 30 minute choreography explored Laban's visual model of the icosahedron as the ideal Platonic solid within which to inscribe the harmonic and formal movement patterns or trace-forms of the dancing body. The piece developed a choreographic interpretation of Laban's unique vision, which combines visual art, dance and geometry in a unique understanding of bodily movement and patterning in relation to three-dimensional space. Laban also acknowledged in some of his drawings that geometric modelling not only corresponds to the formalisation of movement within a kinesphere, or the outer sphere within which a dancer moves, but that this geometric shape is also contained inside the body- thus linking macroscopic and microscopic space. Laban sketched patterns of human movement evolving from icosahedral shapes contained in what he called embryonic dance form, which is why our response will develop visual and choreographic analogies between Laban's icosahedral model in kinespheric space, and the appearance of icosahedral shaped organisms, such as icosahedral viruses, at a microscopic level of the human body. The dancers interacted simultaneously with a geometric shape within and without its own corporeality.

Music was also composed for the performance with inspiration taken from icosahedral symmetry.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2AF07FE-BC37-4F4F-BBC0-FA88792D41FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers and members of the public attended the performance and became aware of the potential connections between dance and geometry.

This 30 minute choreography explored Laban's visual model of the icosahedron as the ideal Platonic solid within which to inscribe the harmonic and formal movement patterns or trace-forms of the dancing body. The piece developed a choreographic interpretation of Laban's unique vision, which combines visual art, dance and geometry in a unique understanding of bodily movement and patterning in relation to three-dimensional space. Laban also acknowledged in some of his drawings that geometric modelling not only corresponds to the formalisation of movement within a kinesphere, or the outer sphere within which a dancer moves, but that this geometric shape is also contained inside the body- thus linking macroscopic and microscopic space. Laban sketched patterns of human movement evolving from icosahedral shapes contained in what he called embryonic dance form, which is why our response will develop visual and choreographic analogies between Laban's icosahedral model in kinespheric space, and the appearance of icosahedral shaped organisms, such as icosahedral viruses, at a microscopic level of the human body. The dancers interacted simultaneously with a geometric shape within and without its own corporeality.

The performance was followed by a specialist panel with presentations from a mathematician and a biologist on aspects of icosahedral symmetry relevant to their research interests, and then a Q and A.

Researchers and members of the public attended the performance and became aware of the potential connections between dance and geometry. In discussion afterwards, members of the audience responded very positively to the experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.miles.surrey.ac.uk/solidsensevideo</gtr:url><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Halfway MILES Presentation of 'Non-Invasive Sleep Monitoring'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEB3906E-8AFE-40A3-80B2-48B2B1B12AF6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a Pecha Kucha-style talk given at the Halfway Miles event.

The talk gave a brief description of the fundamental processes that drive the sleep-wake cycle and presented the results from our MILES funded project.

The project looks at how mathematical models can be used to model the sleep-wake cycle, focussing on whether mathematical models could bring some insight into changes in the sleep/wake cycle occurring with age. For example, when young we tend to want to go to bed and get up late. When older, we tend to go to bed and wake up early, and experience shorter, more fragmented sleep. We show that all of these changes can be explained by varying just one &amp;quot;ageing&amp;quot; parameter in the model.

MILES has had a transformative effect upon interdisciplinary research at Surrey, as demonstrated through the creation of 31 new research projects, the funding of 10 discipline hops, 5 visiting scholars and 5 interdisciplinary workshops. We supported around 100 collaborators across all four faculties of the university. 

Academic impact beyond Surrey has come about through workshops and interaction with visiting scholars. For example, we part-funded an international academic workshop on quantum biology, bringing together biologists and physicists around a theme with the potential for truly transformative research.

So far, the demonstrable external impact of MILES has mainly been through public engagement: we have held public dance performances, such as `Solid Senses', whose choreography was inspired by icosahedral symmetry and its appearance in virus structure and there have been engagement events directly related to MILES funded research projects, including Jim Al-Khalili's Royal Institution lecture 'Quantum Life: How Can Physics Revolutionise Biology?' which has been viewed by over 150,000 people on You Tube.

One of our most successful projects 'Beyond the Visual: Augmented Reality in Spaces of Exhibition' held a public dissemination event at Watts Gallery to demonstrate its technology to potential museum and gallery partners and to the media, while 'Community Microbes' engaged members of the public and schoolchildren in running 'kitchen sink' microbiology experiments. Another of our projects has formed an ongoing collaboration with Surrey Police.

MILES has focused on supporting early stage interdisciplinary research collaborations and so we expect demonstrable research outcomes to continue to emerge over the next few years as the projects that we initiated mature.

In total we supported around 100 collaborators across all four faculties of the university. 

We also designed and organised 8 Networking Events, 20 Cafe Scientifique-inspired Collaboration Cafe events, 12 Behind the Scenes Tours of labs, research centres and workshops, 2 Interdisciplinarity in Practice events, 2 Creative Collaboration workshops, 2 sandpit-inspired Ideas Exchange events, an Industry and Stakeholder Day, 6 Showcase Events presenting the MILES funded projects, a Meet the Architect event creating connections with local experts and professionals and 'Halfway MILES', a celebration and sharing at the midway point of the MILES programme. MILES concluded with a final event 'Collaboration Surrey: the MILES we've come' that presented the work of the MILES funded projects to the university's research community and launched Collaboration Surrey, the internally funded successor to the MILES programme.

The primary outcome of the MILES programme is a cultural legacy of increased interdisciplinary research collaboration at the University of Surrey between mathematics, computer science, engineering and the physical sciences on the one hand and the life and social sciences, humanities and arts on the other. There is a greater enthusiasm among our community of researchers for interdisciplinary interaction and a greater awareness of the range of research being carried out in other disciplines.

Control and epileptiform population spikes (PSs) were elicited in granule cells of the dentate gyrus in mouse (male Balb/c mice 1-3 month-old) hippocampal slices in the absence and presence of the GABAA receptors using the antagonist, bicuculline (10 &amp;micro;M), respectively (Foster et al., 2013). Due to reduced synaptic inhibition, the epileptiform PSs displayed 2-3 additional spikes and significantly increased PS area-under-the-curve (Foster et al., 2013). However, the LZ complexity was significantly reduced from 0.184&amp;plusmn;0.065 for control PS to 0.077&amp;plusmn;0.056 for epileptiform PS (n = 6, P &amp;lt; 0.01, One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's multiple comparisons), demonstrating that the epileptiform PSs display a high firing rhythmicity. Applying the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (10 &amp;micro;M) in the presence of bicuculline significantly increased LZ complexity to 0.159&amp;plusmn;0.070 (P &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 6), a value similar to that of the control PS, although the additional epileptiform spikes were not abolished. Furthermore, the baclofen-induced effects were inhibited by the selective GABAB receptors antagonist CGP55845 (1 &amp;micro;M) (P &amp;lt; 0.01).</gtr:description><gtr:id>5896BAFC-320D-4A0F-90AD-4D47755D9AC9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>this novel approach of using LZ complexity analysis may be further explored to discover new antiepileptic targets.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>hippocampal slice in vitro</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.surrey.ac.uk/mes/people/daniel_abasolo/#research-tab</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The system developed has provided the means of analysing human and animal blood samples from finger/tail pricks.

with mathematicians to develop models to interpret the data they generate. In the past the Diabetes and
Metabolic Medicine group have collaborated with mathematicians outside the University. This project has
enabled the group to develop a collaboration within the University which we aim to build on. The development
of an excel calculator has provided a tool which the physiologist can use to explore the impact of the model
parameters on the model fit giving them an insight into the model design. Although the original model was the
simplest possible based on known data, other models now have to be explored. Finding a model that fits the
data may provide a greater understanding of HDL metabolism. Its only with improved understanding that it becomes possible to develop treatments which can raise HDL levels and reduce CVD risk.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Mathematical modelling of apolipoprotein A1-containing lipoproteins in males and females</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - human</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A small molecule (molecular weight &amp;lt; 350) was discovered which inhibits the DNA repair enzyme AAG with an IC50 of ~75 uM.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E83F76E3-D249-496F-8652-B6687F8AD2AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The availability of this hit molecule validates AAG as a target which can be inhibited with a small molecule.

In this study the median was used as the threshold Td in the sequence conversion, given that the me-dian is robust to outliers [Na02]. A sequence P = s(1), s(2),?, s(n) is created by comparison the original signal with the threshold, with s(i) given by: 
 (1)
Once this coarse-grained sequence has been created from the original signal, P is scanned from left to right and the complexity counter c(n) is increased by one unit every time a new subsequence of consecutive characters is encountered. A detailed description of the complexity algorithm can be found in [Zh01].
The complexity algorithm is dependent on the sequence length. For this reason, c(n) should be normalized. For a sequence of length n and an alphabet of ? symbols, the upper bound of c(n) is given by [LZ76]: 
 (2)
where ?n is a small quantity and ?n ? 0 (n ? ?). In general,
 (3)
Therefore, c(n) can be normalized via b(n): 
 (4)
C(n) is then the normalized LZ complexity. Greater C(n) values correspond to more complexity in the data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AD961C2C-7B25-4081-89EC-B3319B9B3C28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>allowed rhythmicity analysis of epileptiform activity</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Lempel-Ziv complexity analysis</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-00846-2_142#page-1</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Let's explore is a web based system that allows organisations to put in content and then to be able to use the content to generate digital exhibitions.

FootMILES was a development aimed at eventual deployment to groups of school children, encouraging them to walk to school and during days out with their families. FootMILES tracks walking using a novel Android based mobile app that recognizes landmarks, such as buildings, encountered on walks. Children might in the future photograph the building to earn FootMILES points. The Android image recognition app and server backend were fully developed during this funded subproject and demonstrated with a small group of Year 7 children at the George Abbot school Guildford in a focus group, generating a follow-up report containing feedback on FootMiles. A supporting website enabling children to discover nearby walks was subsequently prototyped in response to this feedback but not fully implemented due to constraints on the scope of the project funding and duration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>59EFB085-D5CA-4979-A967-6E76159E8505</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Early follow-up discussions with 2x SMEs keen to licence the mobile image recognition App.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>FootMiles - Prototype (Android App and Website)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.footmiles.org</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>A composer's notebook that helps coordinate editing, playback, recording and discussion around the music composition process.
