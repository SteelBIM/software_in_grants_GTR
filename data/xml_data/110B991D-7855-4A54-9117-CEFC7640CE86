Since whistle-blower Edward Snowden's revelations of 2013 we arguably live in a qualitatively and materially different techno-cultural period. Snowden revealed the surveillance activities of US and UK government signals intelligence agencies, catching unaware academic computer scientists, information specialists and privacy experts. Meanwhile, social media have normalized the practice of people watching each other by mediated means. Given this novel techno-cultural condition of increased, normalized and forced transparency, what are the academic responses? Building on Jeremy Bentham, we suggest that today, there are at least 3 forms of transparency: 
1.Liberal transparency - that opens up machinations of power for public and democratic inspection, using knowledge as a force for promoting societal net benefit and happiness; 
2.Radical transparency - that opens up both public processes and the private lives of citizens for inspection;
3. And what we term forced transparency - the negative consequences of radical transparency, ie where resistance to transparency is tantamount to guilt and where choice and autonomy are stripped away.

Aims &amp;amp; Objectives
While we have begun a typology of transparency, the boundaries in practice are unclear, as is the extent, and consequences, of society's move towards Bentham's vision of radical transparency. We envisage expanding this typology while exploring cases where boundaries blur. Recognizing that privacy is a qualified right, our starting point is that transparency is not inherently dystopian. Rather, we aim to understand the implications and responses to how positively conceived norms might be perverted. As such, our 2-year Seminar Series will explore, from multi-disciplinary/end user perspectives, how different aspects of transparency (whether voluntarily entered into, or state/commercially/peer-imposed) affect questions of privacy, security, surveillance and trust. These areas have been chosen, as transparency violates privacy; is argued as necessary for security; indiscriminately mass surveills; and both demands and compromises trust.
To explore these topics, we will draw on perspectives from Journalism, Media, Sociology, Criminology, Law, Politics, International Relations, Intelligence, Business, History, Computer Science and Philosophy, and on end users from media, journalism, law, governing bodies, regulators, Non-Governmental Organisations, business and security.
Seminars will be hosted in Bangor, Aberystwyth, Sheffield and London, and will be free to participants. We will produce: a web site hosting seminar summaries, a blog, and a Final Report outlining areas of academic consensus/dissensus; policy briefs compiled for end users; and a short documentary on transparency hosted on a video-sharing site, with a 6-second Vine clip. We will produce a Special Issue on transparency in an open-access, international, peer reviewed academic journal to illuminate and theorise social norms and consequences of transparency. We will generate an inter-disciplinary research agenda on transparency, to progress future research bids and conferences.

Potential Applications &amp;amp; Benefits
Beyond academics, beneficiaries include: commercial and government organizations engaged in transparency; trans-national regulatory bodies, and NGOs, lawyers and media outlets concerned with transparency; and citizens engaged in, and affected by, transparency practices. Academics and end users will better understand: (a) benefits of data collection, storage and analysis; (b) challenges on issues of privacy, security, surveillance and trust; and (c) cross-overs on these issues between state and commercial institutions. Impacts are expected from starting a public debate on transparency that may change transparency-related social and cultural practices of key actors (including citizens), so contributing to social, policy and economic change (as key actors better understand evolving norms).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries below have been categorized into (a) those who have agreed to participate and (b) those who have not yet confirmed, but would benefit:
1. Commercial organizations concerned with transparency: (a) Tesco (H.Crooks), Planet Labs (A.Obeidah); GeoIncognita (A.Taverner); (b) Vodafone, G4S, Google. 
2. Government agencies concerned with transparency: (b) Information Commissioner UK (C.Graham); National Crime Agency, UK.
3. Trans-national regulatory bodies concerned with data flow: (b) European Commission (DGs Home Affairs &amp;amp; Justice, N.Kroes, Comm for Digital Agenda); European Parliament (LIBE Committee, M.Schaake); Council of Europe (eg Data Protection Commissioner E.Souhrada-Kirchmayer); European Data protection supervisor (P.Hustinx).
4. National and international non-profit organisations campaigning for open data or against surveillance: (a) Privacy International (S.Davies); Statewatch (T.Bunyan); (b) Open Data Institute (G.Starks); Open Rights Group; Digital Rights Watch; Big Brother Watch.
5. National and international media and journalism outlets and lawyers concerned with transparency: (a) Julian Assange's (Wikileaks) lawyer (M.Stephens); International Modern Media Institute (B.J&amp;oacute;nsd&amp;oacute;ttir); Bureau of Investigative Journalism (C.Hird); (b) Guardian editor (A.Rusbridger); Whistle Blowers Press Agency; English PEN.
6. Citizens engaged in sousveillant practices, and subjected to liberal, radical and forced transparency.

End users 1-5(a) will benefit by participating in seminars on issues of technical capabilities, consent, trust, appropriate use, boundaries, and political and commercial power on transparency practices. These end users will both convey and better understand: beneficial possibilities for data collection, storage and analysis; challenges on issues of privacy, security, surveillance and trust; cross-overs on these issues between state, commercial and non-profit institutions; corporations, states' and citizens' responsibilities and practicesegarding gaining proper consent for their transparency practices; and public opinion on, media representations of, and campaigners' efforts on, these issues. These aspects impact public trust of transparency technologies; the corporations that provide these technologies; and uses to which governments put these technologies. Achieving better understanding is crucial as we are in a period of flux regarding transparency capabilities and practices, and peoples' awareness of forced transparency, with attitudes potentially ripe for change.

End users beyond seminar participants (eg 1-5(b)) will be engaged via policy briefs sent to targeted end users; on-going discussion on the project's blog; and our contributions to The Conversation (an online news outlet sourced from experts).

Access to the latest research framed in clear and policy-relevant terms, and to key players involved in agenda-building on these issues, will enable corporations and governments to better assess and respond to wider attitudes to transparency, so enabling them to hone their transparency-related products/policies, enhancing economic performance, policy and public acceptability of policy.

End user 6 will benefit from a documentary hosted for free, indefinitely on Vimeo, explaining key points on transparency, especially concerning privacy, security, surveillance and trust. The 6-second Vine will elicit interest in the documentary and project website. These will enable citizens to become better informed about the implications of their own, and others' transparency practices, so equipping citizens to engage more carefully with transparency technologies. 

Thus, impacts will arise from achieving mutual understanding of perspectives and practices of multiple actors in the area of transparency. If taken on board, this knowledge may change their transparency practices, so contributing to social, policy and economic change.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30365</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Veillance
Veillance is a web application which transforms data produced by a user's digital device into an interconnected typographic artwork. In an immersive exhibition, users connect to Veillance's wifi. This projects their unencrypted public data streams onto the room's four walls, re-rendered creatively to pick out watchwords from state surveillance lists. It also makes visible the commerical companies to whom the data flow goes. Thus, it raises awareness of being surveilled digitally by governmental and commercial organisations. Veilance exhibited in Pontio Arts and innovation Centre from 24 Feb 2017 - mid March. Prototypes were exhibted in FACT, Liverpool in 2016.

The aim of Seminar 5 was to focus on the ongoing attempts at the European and international level to regulate, confine and oversee the global flow of information. To do so, it brought together scholars and practitioners of international relations, political science, international law, human rights, media and journalism to examine key debates, analyse strengths and weaknesses of existing mechanisms of regulation and oversight and explore questions about which political level is best suited to such a demanding mandate. 

The event attracted 30 participants, some international (Japan, Germany, Estonia, Spain): 25 academics and 5 end users (artist, company, think tank, NGO, Information Commissioners Office)

We produced a 3-page report on Policy Recommendations DATA-PSST! seminar 5. 2016. Key recommendations are:
1. We suggest greater transparency about data collection and processing, and about the effectiveness of policies based on such surveillance. 
2. We recommend a particular form of transparency - with opacity built in to protect necessary secrets, but with regular and periodical review of all stages of the data process by diverse actors drawn from citizenry, civil liberties groups, technologists, industry and of course intelligence agencies. 
3. For surveillance systems to work in a predictive capacity, they need and want people to behave freely, so that peoples' real intentions can be discerned. The objective for those interested in maximizing civil liberties and those working in intelligence and security is that people behave in an unconstrained fashion (that is, without being subjected to any 'chilling effect'). After all, the objective of bulk data collection is to discern unusual patterns against normalcy. We argue there is a danger of an 'observer effect' taking place.
4. We suggest that the aims of any governmental or commercial surveillant organisation involved in data collection and processing are publicly articulated more fully and clearly. They should provide more detail than blanket terms such as 'protecting national security', and more meaningful clarity than complex Terms and Conditions and associated tick-boxes of consent and compliance. 
5. For these aims to be better understood within society we suggest the need for greater public engagement by surveillant entities with citizens. This would help generate challenges, dialogue and perhaps even consensus and greater trust. 
6. Technological change on what it is possible to capture, through data, continues apace: contemporary examples include application of artificial intelligence and machine learning, data analytics, biometric devices and emotion detection. Given rapid technological progress that outstrips common understanding of what it is possible to collect, and what it reveals about an individual, we need regular review of both the adequacy of regulation and public preparedness. In other words, as technology develops, do people and politicians understand what is really going on and how it will affect them on a personal, and societal level?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://data-psst.bangor.ac.uk/policy.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DATA-PSST Seminar 6 - Cohering Inter-disciplinary responses and rebuilding the agenda.

It attracted13 participants: academics and 3 end users (artist/designer, journalist, NGO).
We produced a short policy report with the following recommendations:
1. The argument that citizens willingly trade their privacy for the sake of security has been shown to be an over-statement. Public debate should acknowledge and address citizens' very real concerns surrounding surveillance. 
2. Legislators (at national and supra-national levels) should be mindful of the opacity and inaccessibility of the legislation outlining certain obligations, such as data protection legislation, and the emerging requirement for 'privacy by design'. Public bodies should do more to make these obligations more accessible and understandable to engineers and designers faced with such legal obligations.
3. There is a need for greater focus on public accountability from the actions of the state and other bodies collecting information. Transparency alone will not lead to greater accountability. 
4. Governments and others involved in surveillance and data collection should embrace transparency insofar as is possible. Recognising that total transparency may not always be feasible, we recommend a push towards greater translucency - in other words, transparency should not be seen as an 'all or nothing' exercise. 
5. Academics should consider ways of making theories and concepts surrounding privacy, transparency, surveillance and security more accessible to a broader audience through, for example, engaging with the artistic community and providing more accessible messages via social media, to create a public space for engagement on these issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://data-psst.bangor.ac.uk/policy.php.en</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DATA-PSST seminar 3 - Media Agenda-Building, National Security, Trust and Forced Transparency</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAE93AD6-3D63-42A1-9545-CA6ED0E26B95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>35 people attended a full-day workshop debating Media Agenda-Building, National Security, Trust and Forced Transparency.
