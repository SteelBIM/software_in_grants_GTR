&lt;p>However, there is relatively little understanding regarding the characteristics and consequences of those young people who have uncertain future aspirations. Regarding career aspirations for example, some young people may hold vague aspirations such as working with children. Others may have multiple, unrelated aspirations about their future employment such as footballer and teacher. At the more extreme end of the spectrum, there are young people who do not know which job they would like to do in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study will examine antecedents and outcomes of uncertain education and career aspirations using the 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS-70) and the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England (LSYPE). In particular, this study examines:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the characteristics of 14-16 year olds with uncertain education and career aspirations;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the role of socio-economic background in shaping aspirations of young people;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the consequences of uncertainty on school attainment, engagement, and educational participation as well as adult socio-economic and occupational attainment;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>whether the association between uncertainty and school outcomes differs between the 1970 and 1990 cohort. &lt;/li>

Our findings have already been cited in over 30 publications, including peer-reviewed journals and policy reports. Our research has contributed to discussions involving educational policy and career education, and to a research report which discuss the implications of aspirations for policy (e.g., Wong, 2013; Mann, Masey, Glover, Kashefpadkel, 2013; Baird, 2013).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>70B05152-162C-4C9F-A9FA-E476F0A87F16</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Findings indicate that the characteristics of young people who reported uncertain aspirations were similar across the two cohorts. Uncertainty was associated with growing up in a relatively disadvantaged family, with parents who have low educational expectations for their children, and having low academic attainment, low school motivation and lack of belief in one's own ability in both the BCS-70 and LSYPE (Gutman, Sabates &amp;amp; Schoon, 2014;Gutman &amp;amp; Schoon, 2013; Gutman, Schoon, &amp;amp; Sabates, 2012). 



Drawing upon the LSYPE, a pathway model examining the mediators and moderators of uncertain aspirations was tested. For educational uncertainty, the relationship linking socioeconomic status to uncertain aspirations was mediated through parents' educational expectations and the relationship linking academic performance to uncertain aspirations was mediated through parents' educational expectations and adolescents' self-perceived ability (Gutman, Schoon &amp;amp; Sabates, 2012; Sabates, 2011). For career uncertainty, uncertain career aspirations significantly mediated the relationship between socioeconomic status and prior achievement and later educational outcomes (Gutman &amp;amp; Schoon, 2013; Schoon, 2012).



In terms of gender and ethnic differences, males reported greater educational and career uncertainty than females in both the BCS-70 and LSYPE (Gutman, Sabates &amp;amp; Schoon, 2014; Schoon, 2012). In the LSYPE, ethnic minorities were less likely to report uncertainty than white young people (Gutman &amp;amp; Schoon, 2013). In the LSYPE, the consequences of educational uncertainty were worse for males than females (Gutman, Schoon &amp;amp; Sabates, 2012; Sabates, 2011), but there were no gender differences in the consequences of uncertain career aspirations (Gutman &amp;amp; Schoon, 2013;Schoon, 2012). In the LSYPE, school engagement was a significant factor in reducing the likelihood of being uncertain about continuing in education from ages 14 to 16, showing stronger effects for ethnic minority and male adolescents (Gutman, Schoon, &amp;amp; Sabates, 2012). 



In the BCS-70, young people who held uncertain educational and/or career aspirations at age 16 had lower academic achievement and a greater likelihood of not being in education, employment or training (NEET) compared to young people who had certain, high aspirations (Gutman, Sabates &amp;amp; Schoon, 2014). Uncertain career aspirations were also associated with lower wages at age 34 (Gutman, Sabates, &amp;amp; Schoon, 2014). 



In the LSYPE, the consequences of uncertain educational and career aspirations were mixed. Young people who were uncertain about continuing in education at age 15 had lower achievement at age 16 and a greater likelihood of not being enrolled in education at age 18 (Gutman, Schoon &amp;amp; Sabates, 2012; Sabates, 2011). In contrast, when young people were motivated in school, had high perceptions of their academic ability, had parents with high educational expectations for them and received useful career advice, uncertainty in career aspirations was associated with higher academic performance at age 16 and a greater likelihood of educational enrolment at age 18 (Gutman &amp;amp; Schoon, 2013; Schoon, 2012).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that our project on uncertain aspirations will continue to have an impact both in academic and policy spheres. In the scientific community, we will present our findings at future conferences such as AERA, SRA and an international conference on 'Youth success and adaptation in times of social change' in Jena, Germany (invited contribution) JENA. We are also completing a manuscript which we will submit to a peer-reviewed journal examining the moderating role of ethnicity in a developmental pathway model of career uncertainty. In terms of economic and societal impacts, we are discussing our findings with policy analysts at the DfE including Helen Wood who is the Principal Research Officer in the Longitudinal Surveys Team and Richard White who is the Principal Research Officer in Families &amp;amp; Young People Research Team, and will keep them abreast of our future work on uncertain aspirations. Furthermore, we have been invited to submit a full proposal to Nuffield to expand our work on uncertain career aspirations in LSYPE, focusing on changes across secondary school and associated later outcomes including depression, engagement in antisocial activities (e.g., crime), educational attainment, university/college enrolment, early work experiences and being not in education or employment (NEET).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>10FA3132-E0CD-4017-9528-CADA73A5ADB5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.education.gov.uk/ilsype/workspaces/public/wiki/Publications</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2EA6A33A-68BF-4169-BB92-9FEB2ED4CCC7"><gtr:id>2EA6A33A-68BF-4169-BB92-9FEB2ED4CCC7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Uncertain aspirations for continuing in education: antecedents and associated outcomes.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Developmental psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a32f9119dd75e2d7bf506209cd6b534f"><gtr:id>a32f9119dd75e2d7bf506209cd6b534f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gutman LM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0012-1649</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/76351BE9-125D-4B6F-BFF0-92BC662C2B7F"><gtr:id>76351BE9-125D-4B6F-BFF0-92BC662C2B7F</gtr:id><gtr:title>A socio-ecological model of agency: The role of psycho-social and socioeconomic resources in shaping education and employment transitions in England</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Longitudinal and Life Course Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3632f4346fb7c5e16aec9faeff15d5fd"><gtr:id>3632f4346fb7c5e16aec9faeff15d5fd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Schoon I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>17579597</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F07082DA-F6FF-4C06-BDF5-8E385643370C"><gtr:id>F07082DA-F6FF-4C06-BDF5-8E385643370C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Gender Differences in Aspirations and Attainment</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1efaab943d6c9ac08b594ba650ce9f01"><gtr:id>1efaab943d6c9ac08b594ba650ce9f01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gutman L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781139128933</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A4F9D192-BD8A-4909-B95C-3CDFE271A7D5"><gtr:id>A4F9D192-BD8A-4909-B95C-3CDFE271A7D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is uncertainty bad for you?
