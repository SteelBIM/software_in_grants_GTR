Since our project aims to set down important steps towards the development of an artificial chloroplast that can be used as a chassis for the sustainable production of renewable chemicals and biofuels driven by solar energy, Sun2Chem represents an important step towards meeting European needs not only for the right development of a bio-economy, but also for social justice in terms of environment protection and sustainability.
To reach this goal, we will take a bottom-up engineering approach for the development of suitable algal BioBricks (WP1), which will be deposited in the international Genetic Engineered Machines (iGEM) registry. Thus, our results will be partially disseminated at the famous iGEM competition by undergraduates who will be supervised by doctoral and postdoctoral researchers. We will also have doctoral and postdoctoral students working on the metabolic engineering of the photosynthetic pathway (WP2, WP5) as well as the engineering of the hydrogenase, ferredoxin and FNR (WP3) and their characterisation via protein film electrochemistry (WP4). 
Regarding intellectual property rights, it will be important to first patent the improved pathways and biocatalysts obtained in WP2 and WP3 (if the deliverables of WP1 are used for iGEM they cannot be patented) as well as WP5, which is the integration of WP1-4. Patenting issues will be handled according to the rules at each of the participating partners organisations. Upon patenting the findings, therefore, their publication in suitable international well-renowned journals preferentially under an open access scheme will follow. Note that in each WP, every milestone lists a set of deliverables, which themselves correspond to a defined problem that upon resolution can be transformed into concise publications. After publishing, we will disseminate the results not only at the local media but also at scientific meetings. The results obtained in all WPs will be generally disseminated at conferences related to synthetic biology, protein as well as metabolic engineering and more specifically at hydrogenase, electrolytic solar fuel and solar-based renewable energy meetings.
We expect to produce significant results to control electron delivery from Photosystem 1 in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii towards the production of hydrogen and alkanes. Although we may encounter difficulties in engineering a completely O2-tolerant hydrogenase (at atmospheric oxygen concentration of 21%), preliminary results from Partner 1 indicate that mutating the active site of HydA1 can notably improve its tolerance against oxygen. Achieving this goal will be important for patenting the improved biocatalyst and initiate the first experimental trials both in vitro (WP4) and in vivo (WP5), which may even result in a spin-off company to fully realise the technological potential of H2 production (the strong oxygen sensitivity of hydrogenases hinders their industrial use owing to the high-associated costs of producing the required biocatalyst in large-scale). If we can realise the development of this technological feature, there will be certainly a long-term societal benefit: Solar-driven sustainable production of clean energy by algae that do not compete with agricultural land while mitigating the damaging effects of climate change. Upon reaching such a scenario, we would then assess in more detail biosafety as well as biosecurity issues and explore novel interfaces between science and society for the public acceptance of this special kind of genetically modified microorganisms.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>722942</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>How Hydrogenases Work at the Atomic Level</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/N006321/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>C67CE303-3201-4BD8-914E-D65258B524F0</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered how the final stage of assembly of the active site of a [FeFe]-hydrogenase is carried out.
