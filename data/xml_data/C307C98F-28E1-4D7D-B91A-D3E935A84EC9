A major constraint to global food security is crop loss due to plant pests and diseases. With the increasing stringency of conditions under which chemicals are approved for agriculture, the choice of effective fungicides and pesticides will become more limited in the near future. Furthermore, as introgressed host resistance genes are rapidly defeated by pathogens and pests in the field, there is an urgent need to explore sources of disease and pest resistance that are durable and will provide long term food security.
Plants face a constant barrage of pest and microbial threats and defend themselves by employing at least two layers of inducible defence responses. The first layer involves recognition of Pathogen-Associated-Molecular-Patterns (PAMPs) by cell surface pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to mount PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Successful (adapted) pathogens secrete and deliver molecules, effectors, inside host cells to suppress these defences. The second defence layer involves recognition of effectors by immune receptors, or NB-LRR proteins, to evoke effector-triggered immunity (ETI). This recognition is often based on detection of changes by NB-LRRs in the conformational/biochemical state of host proteins that are targeted by effectors. 
Most plants are resistant to most pathogens, which is termed non-host resistance (NHR). By definition this is effective against all genetic variants of a pathogen species, and thus durable. Effector recognition by NB-LRR proteins has been proposed to be a major determinant of NHR in plant species that are closely related to the pathogens' natural hosts. In contrast, evidence exists that inducible NHR in plant species that are distantly related to the pathogen's natural host(s) is the result of the inability of effectors to appropriately target plant proteins and suppress immunity. Recent progress in the identification of plant pathogen effectors, and their targets, has opened new avenues to investigate the contributions of these proteins to determining non-host resistance.
This proposal aims to generate a key understanding of the role of effectors, their targets, and NB-LRR proteins in non-host resistance in the Solanaceae. The Solanaceae include economically important food crops, such as pepper, tomato, and potato, the latter being the world's fourth largest food crop, and the second largest in Europe after wheat. 
We will exploit effector sets from 2 important solanaceous pathogens with differing host ranges: the oomycetes Phytophthora infestans (infects potato and tomato but not pepper) and P. capsici (infects pepper and tomato but not potato). We will assess the contribution of Phytophthora effectors to defining host range. Our key objectives are to (i) assess whether effectors trigger NB-LRR-mediated immunity in non-host solanaceous plants, and (ii) whether inducible NHR in Arabidopsis, constitutes a failure of effectors to modify intended targets and thus suppress PTI. We will exploit the genome sequences of potato, tomato, N. benthamiana, N. sylvestris and pepper to identify targets for P. infestans and P. capsici effectors. We will then be able to investigate their role in mediating effector recognition in non-host solanaceous plants.
The proposed work will shed light on the contribution of NB-LRRs, and the effector targets they monitor, to NHR within solanaceous crops. We will establish an essential platform that determines the molecular basis of NHR, identifies the critical effectors that activate NHR and paves the way to targeted searches for associated genes. Moreover, we will identify Arabidopsis PTI regulatory components, insensitive to effector activity, that can be deployed in Solanaceous crops. This approach will build a highly durable barrier to infection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Effector recognition by NB-LRR proteins has been proposed to be a major determinant of non-host resistance (NHR) in plant species that are closely related to a pathogen's natural hosts. In contrast, evidence exists that inducible NHR in plant species that are distantly related to the pathogen's natural host(s) is often based upon the inability of effectors to appropriately target and disable PTI (Schultze-Lefert and Panstruga 2011).This proposal aims to understand the molecular constraints governing host range of two economically important pathogens of Solanaceae crops, and thus the molecular basis of non-host resistance (NHR). . More specifically, we will test: 1) whether RXLR effectors from Phytophthora infestans and P. capsici can interact with/modify their plant targets and suppress PTI in non-host Solanaceae; 2) whether non-host resistance within the Solanaceae is thus largely based upon detection of effectors by NB-LRR immune receptors to activate ETI; and 3) whether a breakdown in effector-target interaction, or a failure to appropriately manipulate its target results in NHR in distantly-related plant species, such as Arabidopsis. The work will provide a knowledge platform that will direct future searches for naturally occurring nonhost NB-LRRs that protect against these key pathogens. Specifically, transfers of these immune receptors, singly or in combination, from non-host to host solanaceous crops could provide broad-spectrum resistance against economically important pathogens such as P. infestans or P. capsici. If based on PTI, approaches making use of intended targets that escape effector activity but retain their function in activating PTI in Solanaceous hosts, should enable the generation of durably resistant crops.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Solanaceous crops form an essential component of the world's food supply with potato ranking as the most important global non-cereal food crop. Pests and diseases are a major constraint to achieving food security. Up to 50% of crop losses in developing nations are due to pests and diseases. New, durable and sustainable means of combating crop disease therefore offer an opportunity to make a significant impact on food security across the world. The proposed research is expected to benefit a) growers worldwide, especially those in developing countries, b) consumers, c) biotechnology and industry, d) researchers investigating crop diseases and disease resistance and e) the environment by reducing the amount of chemical sprays required for crop protection. 
Historically, growers in Europe have relied on pesticides to produce most of their crops in the face of pressure from pests and diseases. Recent EU directives however, have prohibited or restricted the use of many active ingredients. Thus, growers now face diseases which are difficult to control. Breeding offers an environmentally benign method of controlling diseases by intogression of resistance genes but is inefficient to deal with rapidly changing virulent pathogens. Furthermore, resistances are often not readily deployable into cultivars.
Non-host resistance underlies the inability of a pathogen to cause disease in all plants outside its host range and is thus, by definition, durable. This proposal aims to understand the molecular constraints governing host ranges of distantly related pathogens/pests of Solanaceae crops, and thus the basis of non-host resistance between closely-related species in the Solanaceae. Understanding the molecular basis of non-host resistance offers the prospect of durable resistance against damaging pathogens and thereby a reduction of chemical inputs (including fungicides) and economic losses to growers. This allows sustainable use and management of ecosystem resources; a key aims of the LWEC programme. In addition to addressing food security, resistance transferred from non-host plants offers the prospect of sustainable pathogen management and crop production. This will be of great benefit to consumers, especially in the developing world where food is scarce. Importantly, this proposal aims to translate conceptual advances emerging from fundamental research on both Solanaceae models and Arabidopsis thaliana to important crops. The outcomes of this proposed research will impact the biotechnology industry. Critically, this is an IPA proposal, with the companies Simplot and Syngenta directly investing in the research as Industrial Partners. They aim to assess and exploit the potential of disease resistance-associated genes arising from this work to achieve durable resistance in Solanaceous crops, with Simplot focussing on potato late blight, and Syngenta focussing on Phytophthora diseases of tomato and pepper.
The work described in this proposal is timely as it will exploit genome information for 2 economically important oomycete pathogens, and the recently completed potato, tomato, pepper and N. benthamiana genome sequences. Outcomes of the project will have a high impact on the research community and raise the profile of research staff involved through peer-reviewed publications and invitations to conferences. This project will provide excellent training and career development opportunities for two PDRAs, and exposure directly to commercial exploitation of their research. 
We will engage with the public and stakeholders at regular, institute organized events such as Potatoes in Practice, open days and school visits. We will involve our biotechnology industry partners Simplot and Syngenta in the direction and progress of the research, seeking to accelerate the use of resistance-associated genes from nonhost plants in economically important Solanaceous crops.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>140792</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Huazhong Agricultural University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Potato in China</gtr:description><gtr:id>4BA6DE80-70A4-4483-8021-E891D6CD8331</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Preparation of manuscripts detailing dRenSeq and mapping of PVY resistance</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Phenotyping of potato populations that segregate for LB and PVY resistances</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>dRenSeq analysis revealed that quantitative resistance to late blight in segregating population is based on R8.

The data have been presented to the Industrial partners at progress meetings in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and Simplot has agreed to take forward some of the Arabidopsis orthologues genes of P. infestans host targets that evade interactions with P. infestans effectors if their transient expression in N. benthamiana promotes resistance. The concept was also presented at Potato in Practise (Dundee, 2015). A manuscript detailing Pathogenicity factor enrichment and sequencing (PathSeq) which enables massively parallel diagnostic analysis of avirulence genes and revised genome annotation of Phytophthora infestans RXLR effectors has been submitted to Genome Biology in March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C8087737-AFAC-4C80-8664-0EA8A6E77B46</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project commenced on the 27th of January 2014 and aims to generate a fundamental understanding of the contribution of Phytophthora virulence determinants (effectors), their plant targets, and host resistance proteins to non-host resistance (NHR). The first Objective was to investigate whether effectors from each pathogen trigger non-host specific resistance responses. As part of this objective we cloned priority effectors from P. infestans and P. capsici into plant expression vectors. Following microarray studies performed in-house for P. infestans, 90 RXLRs-containing virulence determinants were cloned into agro-binary vector pGRAB, and have also been cloned into the viral vector pGR106 (PVX). Following homology-based MCL clustering and microarray studies for P. capsici, 48 RXLR-containing virulence determinants have been cloned or synthesised and have been transferred into plant expression vectors. The second part of this objective was to identify recognition events of RXLR-containing virulence determinants in non-host plants. We determined that PVX was the best vector for RXLR expression screens in genotypes of potato, pepper, and tomato. However, agro-infiltration of expression constructs into Nicotiana sylvestris provides the most reproducible and facile screening procedure for potential NHR recognition. N. sylvestris emerged as a promising route to seek candidate NHR resistance genes - it is diploid, the genome has been sequenced, and transient expression is as facile as in N. benthamiana. Critically, as a common non-host, any follow-up work to seek R genes could involve cloning all R gene candidates from only this plant for subsequent functional assays in N. benthamiana with recognised effectors from both P. infestans and P. capsici. We have screened over 90 P. infestans effectors and identified a total of 4 effectors that consistently triggered cell death response in Nicotiana sylvestris. Only 1 of these effectors, PITG_04145, also yielded cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, whereas PITG_10540, PITG_16195 and PITG_18215 did not produce visible symptoms in N. benthamiana. A similar screen of 48 P. capsici effectors identified 8 RXLRs that yielded a recognition response in N. sylvestris (PcRxLR008, PcRXLR011, PcRXLR018, PcRXLR019, PcRXLR030, PcRXLR089, PcRXLR138 and PcRXLR467). Of these, PcRXLR030, PcRXLR089 and PcRXLR0138 did not produce visible responses in N. benthamiana.

Similarly, we have included tomato accessions that carry Rpi_Ph2 or Rpi_Ph3 resistances alongside susceptible controls. After screening of more than 100 RXLR effectors, 5 Avr-Ph3 candidates were identified. Indeed, PITG_16240, PITG_16427, PITG 23015, PITG_23226 and PITG_11484 were triggering HRs in the Rpi-Ph3 tomato lines only. Phylogenetic analysis of these Avr-Ph3 candidates revealed that PITG_16240 and PITG_16427 are related, as are PITG_23015 and PITG_23226.

We reported in 2013 on the conception and implication of RenSeq, a method to enrich for NB-LRR genes prior to sequencing (Jupe et al 2013). We have successfully adapted this technology to pathogen RXLR effectors (PathSeq). The platform has been adapted to facilitate enrichment and sequencing of P. infestans and P. capsici RXLR effectors. A proof of concept study has been conducted by multiplexing 6 P. infestans and 6 P. capsici isolates, respectively. Included in the analysis were the reference isolates T30-4 and LT1534. We have submitted a manuscript detailing PathSeq to Genome Biology in March 2017. The main findings are: Target enrichment sequencing of 579 P. infestans and 574 P. capsici genes was conducted in parallel for twelve isolates. Under high-stringent mapping conditions PathSeq reads displayed a higher than 50 % on-target rate and over 87 % of all targeted genes from the reference genomes were fully represented. PathSeq revealed presence/absence variations and sequence polymorphisms for known Avr genes across different pathogen genotypes. Hybridization of P. infestans and P. capsici-derived baits identified 30 additional RXLR effectors in novel parts of the T30-4 genome. A subsequent de novo annotation identified 1367 putative RXLR-containing regions of which 631 displayed evidence of expression in at least three publically available RNAseq datasets. 
We conclude that PathSeq enables the massively parallel sequence polymorphism study of effectors, facilitating the molecular characterization of Phytophthora isolates for population studies. The technology provides a novel diagnostic tool to predict the efficacy of host resistances in the face of pathogen population shifts. A large number of novel RXLR candidates were identified through PathSeq and a de novo analysis. 

Objective 2 aimed at establishing whether effector activity determines pathogen host ranges within Solanaceae and/or Arabidopsis by identifying host protein targets of candidate effectors from P. infestans and P. capsici. On a previous grant (BBSRC LOLA), more than 70 Pi effectors have been screened to considerable depth in a potato-P. infestans interaction Y2H library. This has revealed approx. 200 potato proteins as candidate targets of these effectors. As our ultimate aims are to transfer Arabidopsis (At) orthologues of Pi/Pc effector targets into Solanceous crops (potato, tomato, pepper), the group in Warwick has focused on Arabidopsis as a main priority. As part of the previous grant indicated above, 90 P. infestans RXLRs have been screened against the set of 12000 Arabidopsis genes cloned into yeast that has recently been reported for screening by effectors from G. orontii (Wessling et al 2014 Cell Host-Microbe 16:364-375). This has formed a basis to compare the non-host interactome of Pi-At with the host interactomes of At with H. arabidopsidis (Hpa), P. syringae tomato (Pst) and G. orontii.

The group in Warwick has identified Arabidopsis orthologues of potato proteins bound by P. infestans effectors and screened these to see a) whether the P. infestans effectors can bind the Arabidopsis orthologues and b) whether Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis effectors bind the Arabidopsis orthologue proteins. 128 Arabidopsis orthologues have been screened against 90 P. infestans effectors and 200 H. arabidopsidis effectors. Interactions of host vs non-host effectors with plant targets fall into 4 categories depending on whether interactions are conserved or not, and whether H. arabidopsidis effectors target the same protein. One Arabidopsis orthologue protein remains to be screened against the library of effectors. 

As part of the collaboration knockout mutants for potato target proteins and for Arabidopsis orthologues of potato targets have been generated and demonstrated that many of these effector target proteins play a role in pathogen defence. We have a number of additional Arabidopsis lines knocked out for orthologues of effector target proteins which need screening for any altered susceptibility to H. arabidopsidis.

We have also identified effectors that suppress PTI in non-host Solanaceae and seen that effectors are less likely to enhance pathogen colonisation in a non-host compared to a host plant. We have a small number of effectors which have been overexpressed in Arabidopsis but the transgenic lines have not yet been characterised for pathogen susceptibility.

We have identified two such target proteins indicating that transfer of &amp;quot;orthologues&amp;quot; unable to be correctly targeted by P. infestans effectors into the Solanaceae may be a strategy to enhance resistance to P. infestans. Priority Arabidopsis orthologues have been tested in N. benthamiana and two candidates have been sent to Simplot to generate transgenic potatoes to test for reduced infection.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Industrial partners Simplot and Syngenta have expressed significant interest in the Arabidopsis orthologues genes of Solanaceae host targets that evade the interactions with P. infestans/ P. capsici RXLR effectors.
