&lt;p>The applicants have recently published a general theoretical framework to analyse the choice of optimal legal standards - and in particular the choice between a Per Se&amp;nbsp; and an Effects-Based Legal Standard. This framework:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>formalises and clarifies many existing informal discussions of this topic using the decision-cost theoretic approach; &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>extends the decision cost theoretic approach to a full welfare evaluation incorporating deterrence/ indirect effects.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>They have shown how the approach can be applied to recent landmark decisions&amp;nbsp;- eg European Commission's decision on Microsoft.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of the project is to extend and apply this framework by undertaking theoretical analyses of many other aspects of the enforcement and decision procedures of Competition Authorities:&amp;nbsp; eg role of appeals procedures; legal uncertainty; design of multi-criteria decision rules.&amp;nbsp; The applicants will work closely with two major competition authorities - the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and the French Competition Authority (FCA) - to shape the research questions and setting and to develop some decision tools that these and other authorities can use to think more systematically about many aspects of their practice.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>137053</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with French Competition Authority - Autorite de la Concurrence (AdeC)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7C7D6B8-204B-4D7C-9536-D1B8B51565A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over the course of the project we made 5 presentations on our research to the Chief Economist and his team and, sometimes, the Deputy Director. The presentations sparked questions and reflection on both sides and lead us to both re-think some details of our models and to undertake more work on penalty setting - a major concern to AdeC.

Our work shaped thinking by AdeC on penalty guidelines. The Chief Economist wrote &amp;quot;Discussion on the topic of fine setting was extremely interesting and timely as the Autorit&amp;eacute; was in the middle of a process to write its own sentencing guidelines (this was ultimately done in May 2011). Although our guidelines on the setting of fines for anticompetitive behaviour were primarily driven by the legal requirements of the French Code of Commerce and our past case law, all the discussions that we have had with - among other - academic economists (and therefore with Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph) have greatly influenced our discussions internally and helped thus drafting our guidelines.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010,2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement with UK Competition Authority (Office for Fair Trading)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A29FBCDC-BD9D-4C17-A70D-7123087BD3EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There were three major results: (i) we better understood the importance of penalties to OFT; (ii) our work on legal uncertainty was of enormous interest to OFT since they were having a review of their penalties and lead to our giving a presentation to a very wide audience inside OFT and to being invited to submit evidence when they went out to consultation on proposal to increase penalties from 10% of revenue to 30% of revenue.

There were two notable impacts:
(i) our conclusion that legal uncertainty could be a reason for raising penalties - rather than lowering them as had previously been asserted in legal literature influenced their decision to go out to consultation on raising penalties - by factor of 3
(ii) our calculations of optimal penalties - subsequently published in Economic Journal gave then confidence that their proposed penalty of 30% was well supported.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2010,2011,2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our research contributed to the thinking of the Office of fair Trading as to whether or not to increase penalties from 10% to 30%. Our research on legal uncertainty - on which we did a presentation to them - convinced them that thsi was not an argument against rasising penalties. Our subsequent analysis of the optimal penalty rate suggested that their proposed penalty of 30% lay within the range that could be supported by good theoretical and empirical evidence. Similarly the French Competition Authority (Autorite de la Concurrence) found our research on legal uncertainty and penalties helpful in formulating their new guidelines on penalties.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C0FC0242-6065-4E10-BF0C-35C877771154</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The first aim of this project was to extend in a number of important directions a 2009 paper by the investigators that gave a rigorous evaluation of the conditions under which Effects-Based procedures - now very widely adopted by most competition authorities over past 20 years - are superior to Per Se Procedures. The second aim was to engage closely with two competition authorities - the Office of Fair Trading (UK) and the Autorite de la Concurrence (France) - to explain our emerging research findings and identify issues of concern to them on which our research could shed light. Both were undertaking major reviews of their penalty policies and guidelines. 
Some key findings:
(i) Appeals procedures reduce deterrence which is good if actions are on average benign but bad if actions are on average harmful. They make effects-based procedures more attractive in former case and less attractive in latter.
(ii) Contrary to received legal scholarship: (a) effect-based procedures need not entail legal uncertainty; (b) if penalties are set appropriately welfare may be higher with some degree of legal uncertainty than with none; (c) effects-based procedures unambiguously welfare dominate per se; (d) appropriate penalties may be higher the greater the degree of legal uncertainty. Contrary to Economic scholarship appropriate penalty may be zero if legal uncertainty is very great. 
(iii) Existing theory of optimal penalties ignores possibility that competition authorities sometimes stop on-going actions. This can lead to penalties being 25% lower than existing theory suggests.
(iv) This supports OFT's proposal to raise penalties to 30% of revenue.
(v) Imposing penalties on revenue creates a distortion that raises prices. This can be greater the tougher the penalty regime.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our analysis of penalties has been further developed by ourselves and is also influencing the thinking of other leading scholars in the field - e.g. Harrngton (2014).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0E4AF7A2-8AE5-40E1-ABBE-0DF590F70680</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Influence on Penalty Guidelines by French Competition Authority</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1417CCC-0794-4B34-81E4-44222F1EC827</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impact helped shape the formal penalty guidelines that the Frnch Competition Authority introduced for the first time.

raise the penalty starting point, whereas in their submission Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph put forward arguments and calculations that suggested that the optimal baseline penalty might if anything be somewhat higher than the 30% proposed in our consultation document, in particular for infringements that suffer from low detection rates.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy
