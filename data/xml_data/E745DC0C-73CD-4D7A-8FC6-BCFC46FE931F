For example, if someone does something stupid, their friend may make the comment, ?That was clever!?, which on the surface of it, is the opposite of what they actually mean.

In order to examine more specific emotional responses, eye movements while reading, and electrical brain activity while listening, will be used to assess whether people expect ironic comments to be more hurtful, or more amusing, than their literal counterparts.&lt;/p>

Although the proposed project is grounded in basic research in psychology, it clearly has the potential to have impact in more applied areas in which person perception and social functioning play an important role. In the short term, the proposed project would stimulate research undertaken by a wide range of associated researchers, principally those interested in language comprehension and social cognition. In the medium term, more comprehensive theoretical accounts of emotional processes involved in language comprehension are likely to be developed. In the long term, our understanding of these processes may feed into other fields with direct social and economic impact. Specifically, it is likely that a number of user groups will ultimately benefit from this research; from clinical and educational psychologists interested in developing remedial techniques for conditions where figurative language comprehension is impaired, to practitioners interested in effective ways of delivering criticism and praise in professional settings.

Clinical and educational psychologists
Studying how people understand figurative language can contribute to our understanding of situations where this process breaks down, such as autism and schizophrenia. Indeed, a number of recent articles have highlighted the fact that people with conditions which lead to impaired social cognition also tend to have problems comprehending certain kinds of figurative language, such as metaphor and irony (see e.g., Solomon et al., 2011 as an example of recent research showing deficits in irony comprehension for participants with autism and schizophrenia). Given the very common use of figurative language in everyday communication, deficits in understanding this kind of language can present significant challenges to these populations. Building our knowledge of how figurative language is processed in non-clinical populations can feed in to the development of techniques to remediate these deficits. For instance, very recent research has highlighted ways in which this knowledge can be used to help children with autism to understand metaphors (e.g., Persicke, Tarbox, Ranick, &amp;amp; St. Clair, 2012). Thus, adding to the knowledge base involved in understanding how people comprehend irony could be used in a similar fashion by clinicians and educational psychologists.

Professional communication
The outcomes of this research would be relevant to practitioners interested in professional communication. Specifically, the emotional impact of using irony vs. literal language to convey criticism or praise, and the impact that this has on both the recipient, as well as other members of the team, is likely to be of interest in management and team building situations. In addition, corpus studies have shown that ironic utterances in text are often accompanied by emoticons (see Burgers, van Mulken, &amp;amp; Schellens, 2012, for an overview). Gaining a better understanding of how emoticons influence the emotional impact of a message has clear implications for guidance on their effective use (e.g., in email).

Research staff
The research assistant employed on the project will benefit from receiving training in a broad range of cutting edge research methodologies in Experimental Psychology, Psychophysiology, and Cognitive Neuroscience, as well as gaining the opportunity to develop a publication record, which would provide an excellent basis for a research career. In addition to these specific skills, they will gain experience in more general transferable skills such as written and verbal communication which are valued in a wide range of employment sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>180138</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Daily Mail Online</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C123823-92BB-427A-8432-516631B3F709</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Mail Online ran an article based on the following research paper (which is an output of the current grant):

However, it clearly has the potential to have impact in more applied areas in which language comprehension, person perception, and social functioning play an important role. For instance, studying how people comprehend figurative language, which involves understanding the intentions and the behaviour of others can contribute to our understanding, and successful treatment of situations where this process breaks down, such as autism and thought disorders (e.g., schizophrenia). In addition, information regarding the emotional impact of using irony versus literal language to deliver criticism or praise, and the appropriate use of devices such as emoticons, would clearly be of interest in a number of practical domains, such as professional communication. The applicants appreciate that effective communication is an integral part of quality research in the social sciences. In the following, we outline the steps that have so far been taken to increase the likelihood of impacts, by engaging users and beneficiaries. Specifically, in order to disseminate our research to a wider audience, the applicants have carried out a number of activities:

Project web page.
As planned, to promote the aims and findings of the research to a wider audience, we have created a web page relating to the project, where we explain the purposes and results of the research in ways that are accessible to non-academic audiences. On this page, readers can also follow links to the open access publications that have arisen from the project. This information can be found under the 'projects' section of the following site:

http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/Ruth.Filik/

Communicating research through the British Psychological Society (BPS).
We also planned to communicate our research to a more general Psychology audience through the BPS, to publicise the work to users with an interest in areas such as autism or schizophrenia. This was achieved through a podcast as part of the BPS research digest podcast series 'PsyCrunch'. Our research is described in Episode 6, 'How to be sarcastic', which can be found here:

https://digest.bps.org.uk/podcast/

Communication to the general public via the media.
Our research has also been communicated to the general public via a number of newspaper articles (in the Daily Mail Online and Independent newspapers), as well as through the Nottingham University Alumni newsletter.

Research staff.
The postdoctoral researcher employed on the project was able to gain a number of specific research-related skills (for example in the recording of psychophysiological data), as well as more transferable skills in relation to manuscript preparation and conference presentations, resulting in the further development of a strong publication record. Following this project, the researcher was able to secure a permanent academic position.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>32DC8482-A6C3-4A01-AFAC-C64DE54A7CA1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ES/L000121/1 - Examining the emotional impact of verbal irony

The main aim of this project was to investigate factors affecting the emotional impact of using ironic language. More specific objectives were to examine both ironic criticism and praise, to investigate the influence of emoticons, to look at specific emotional responses (such as amusement), as well as whether these responses are influenced by the perspective that is taken by the participant. Our research successfully met these objectives, revealing the following key findings:

Key finding 1: Emotional impact

Theorists agree that irony serves some communicative function that would not be achieved by speaking directly, such as eliciting a particular emotional response. Results from rating studies showed that ironic criticism was judged as less negative than literal criticism, and ironic praise as less positive than literal praise, suggesting that irony serves to mute emotional impact (Filik et al., 2016). In contrast, more immediate emotional responses to irony were found to be enhanced compared to those for literal language (Filik et al., 2015). This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by eye-tracking data suggesting that sarcasm 'stings' initially, but is then later rationalised as being more amusing than literal criticism (Filik et al., 2017).

Key finding 2: Emoticons

Devices such as emoticons often accompany irony in computer-mediated communication. Rating studies (Filik et al., 2016) showed that if the sarcastic meaning of a comment can be easily deduced from the context, adding a device (e.g., ;-), :-p, !, or ) will not aid comprehension. However, if the receiver cannot tell from the context whether the comment is intended sarcastically, using an emoticon may reduce misunderstanding. 

In support of this, production studies (Thompson &amp;amp; Filik, 2016) showed that when participants are asked to produce a sarcastic message or modify an ambiguous message to clarify its meaning, emoticons (especially ;-) and :-p) were commonly used to indicate sarcastic intent.

Using psychophysiological measures to capture emotional responses showed higher emotional arousal accompanied by reduced frowning and enhanced smiling for messages with rather than without an emoticon, suggesting that emoticons increase positive emotions (Thompson et al., 2016).

Key finding 3: Perspective

The emotional impact of criticism may be quite different depending on the perspective that is taken. Eye-tracking data (Filik et al., 2017) suggest that participants experience more difficulty processing an amused response to criticism when viewed from the perspective of the victim than the protagonist. Participants' electrical brain activity also showed larger emotion-related responses to criticism when viewed from the perspective of the victim than of the protagonist. When focus is on the victim, perceivers may concentrate more on the negative aspect of the comment, whereas when focus is on the perspective of the protagonist, they may consider the reasons behind the remark, and perceive it more positively.

Outside of the academic community, the current findings may be taken forward by those interested in effective professional communication (i.e., delivery of criticism and praise), and may be put to use more broadly by the general public interested in the effective use of emoticons. They may also be used to inform clinical practice in populations where the comprehension of irony may be impaired (e.g., autism and schizophrenia), again perhaps in relation to the effective use of devices such as emoticons in order to clarify the intent of a message.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>58E1F8C8-8A4C-4C28-BB4B-B400BB99D809</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.psychology.nottingham.ac.uk/staff/Ruth.Filik/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6675BCE0-FF9C-4277-88CF-A513E373A00A"><gtr:id>6675BCE0-FF9C-4277-88CF-A513E373A00A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Irony and emoticons: Comprehension and emotional impact</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings of AMLaP XX</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/553e43be55bc8fd269a02565a522562a"><gtr:id>553e43be55bc8fd269a02565a522562a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>filik r</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/66390D66-93F1-4015-B68B-C81B231D98CB"><gtr:id>66390D66-93F1-4015-B68B-C81B231D98CB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The emotional impact of verbal irony: Eye-tracking evidence for a two-stage process</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Memory and Language</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9cbb7ad805c021f233aa89d06d817bc2"><gtr:id>9cbb7ad805c021f233aa89d06d817bc2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Filik R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/58F7268F-2DF3-4BD3-BA9C-58F0CD11462B"><gtr:id>58F7268F-2DF3-4BD3-BA9C-58F0CD11462B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Emotional responses to irony and emoticons in written language: Evidence from EDA and facial EMG.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychophysiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/89671d6057589cce26f1200cdcf226ee"><gtr:id>89671d6057589cce26f1200cdcf226ee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thompson D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0048-5772</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/99493866-CD8C-4B9B-939F-F72A12036F1E"><gtr:id>99493866-CD8C-4B9B-939F-F72A12036F1E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sarcasm in Written Communication: Emoticons are Efficient Markers of Intention</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/89671d6057589cce26f1200cdcf226ee"><gtr:id>89671d6057589cce26f1200cdcf226ee</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Thompson D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/ADDE1B86-7819-4EF1-B294-5A1BFC7B2217"><gtr:id>ADDE1B86-7819-4EF1-B294-5A1BFC7B2217</gtr:id><gtr:title>An eye-tracking investigation of written sarcasm comprehension: The roles of familiarity and context.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of experimental psychology.
