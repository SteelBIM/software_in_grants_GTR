The carrier for the power and communications is an intermediate Frequency AC (IFAC) power network. The consortium members Isotera (lead), Xsilon and Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) have complementary skills and knowledge adequate for the successful completion of this project. The combination of Xsilon's &amp;quot;Hanadu&amp;quot; powerline communications (PLC) technology with Isotera's IFAC system is potentially a breakthrough, making it a cost-effective (ca. 30% cheaper per node) alternative to wireless communication systems. The prime aim of this project is to create prototypes of the physical layer suitable for lab trials, design a model of the network for performance prediction
and a new relay algorithm to reduce transmit power and improve network coverage. Key challenges are efficient contactless signal transfer, power consumption, node cost and passive links between IFAC loops.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There are a number of potential beneficiaries of this research beyond traditional academic dissemination. The key ones are:

1. Energy Management Industry
The results from this project can be used to enable a number of energy management applications, the most obvious being intelligent lighting controls - with high-density sensor networks minimising stand-by losses. Isotera, the lead company, sells an industry-leading stand-alone lighting control system through an international network of channel partners. This project will allow Isotera to complement its product range by offering networked lighting management systems through the same channels. Other applications enabled by this research are: (a) Real-time fine grain energy monitoring for optimising the occupant comfort versus energy efficiency trade-off; (b) Tactical deployment of Demand Response signal throughout buildings; (c) Cost-effective common control layer for lighting and other building controls. These applications require an increasing level of integration with the products and services of 3rd parties.

2. Powerline Communication (PLC) Industry
This project will investigate new techniques designed to increase the efficiency and reliability of PLC systems. The outcomes of this research will be of great value to UK companies involved in developing robust power line networks for the purpose of home automation. The proposed project will yield novel signal processing solutions in highly dynamic channels, which can be used to support various applications related to smart grids, such as smart metering, real-time sensing and monitoring for distributed generators and power plans. Research concepts developed during this project will underpin
efficient design of practical PLC system with relatively high throughput. These will have low transmission power, using an energy efficient relaying scheme to cover a wider range and operating within acceptable EMC limits level. 

3. UK economy and society
The results achieved by this project will be industry-leading in terms of the cost (ca. 15 - 20% lower than traditional systems), and will strengthen the UK's position in the fast-growing global BEMS market. The results will also enable other UK-based companies to develop products and services, creating many more skilled jobs in the UK. All of this will have a positive effect on the UK's economic growth and balance of trade. The project will enable and stimulate the adoption of a number of BEMS applications, reducing energy consumption by up to 30%. The proposed system is more durable and does not require batteries. The results of this project will enable a better trade-off between energy conservation and occupant well-being: automation with a sense of personalised control. The UK economy and society will benefit indirectly, as the project aims to improve the way we use energy, thereby impacting positively on the country's contribution to reductions in global warming.

The impact will be achieved through the following:

1. Dissemination through professional and scientific publications.

2. Workshops will be held before each milestone for information dissemination and discussion. Representatives from industry and relevant partners will be invited to these workshops.

3. A Technology Advisory Group (TAG) will be set up to secure prospective end-user and specifier inputs. Hoare Lea, Laing O'Rourke, Anesco, Day-One Energy, Kiwi Power and EEVS have confirmed interest in joining the TAG and are already providing inputs. Information exchange with TAG members will be done through bilateral meetings and group workshops.

4. The consortium plan special dissemination activities to address selected user groups, application designers, lighting manufacturers, landlords, supermarkets, City councils, and non-technical audiences. 

5. The project activities and progress will be promoted through the project web site. This will be the key project information hub.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>177146</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Xsilon Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MMU_Photon_Xsilon</gtr:description><gtr:id>44ADBAFA-66E3-4AB2-B2AC-30E80AEBDA28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We now have a PLC modem from Xsilon; LED and sensors for Photstars fro testing/measurement and further research</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Xsilon team brings practical experience in PLC modem developement, project management, and explotation, while Photostars brings the expertise in the areas of LED design, end users engagement and technology integration</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a result of this grant Manchester Metropolitan University is in partnership with Xsilon Ltd ( manufacturer of Powerline Communication modems) and Photostars LED ( manufacture of LED luminaries) to develop smart micro grid for building.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>PhotonStar LED</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MMU_Photon_Xsilon</gtr:description><gtr:id>07621E0E-BF91-43D2-B823-EFE1472FA63F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We now have a PLC modem from Xsilon; LED and sensors for Photstars fro testing/measurement and further research</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Xsilon team brings practical experience in PLC modem developement, project management, and explotation, while Photostars brings the expertise in the areas of LED design, end users engagement and technology integration</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>As a result of this grant Manchester Metropolitan University is in partnership with Xsilon Ltd ( manufacturer of Powerline Communication modems) and Photostars LED ( manufacture of LED luminaries) to develop smart micro grid for building.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>180000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>UK-S Korea EPSRC Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-10-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/N03466X/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>37A64C14-5911-4AB6-8360-62993CB51194</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The goal of the project is to use a network of sensors within a building communicating through a low cost powerline based technology (signalling through the mains power network) to reduce the energy consumption within that building.

-The smart microgrid laboratory (established during this project) has become a hands-on training facility for a growing number of BEng and MSc students undertaking research projects in PLC. 
- Adoption of PLC for monitoring and control in energy management systems could potentially reduce energy wastage.

- One of the industrial partners, PhotonStar LED Ltd has successfully taken the building automation system researched as part of this project and produced a product, halcyon CloudBMS, which links together environmental sensors, actuators and LED lighting in a building to reduce energy consumption. It had an initial deployment with IBM in their Hursley Research centre and most recently a first commercial installation with a major UK student accommodation provider. 
-Secondly together Xsilon and PhotonStar have built a demonstrator system which successfully communicates sensor and lighting system information across a network including both powerline and wireless systems based upon a combination of the Halcyon and HAN9250 products.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>85EE5FF8-DB44-4DF6-B0CC-47B1B2B53B72</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F2B414FB-5ECC-4C53-9663-916598711C49"><gtr:id>F2B414FB-5ECC-4C53-9663-916598711C49</gtr:id><gtr:title>Channel characterisation of cooperative relaying power line communication systems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/902b03f6ee36d9cd0b456a3e085cc73b"><gtr:id>902b03f6ee36d9cd0b456a3e085cc73b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rozman M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F35A17D6-092E-4559-9C11-7A4BE035A627"><gtr:id>F35A17D6-092E-4559-9C11-7A4BE035A627</gtr:id><gtr:title>Improving energy efficiency in dual-hop cooperative PLC relaying systems</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e"><gtr:id>1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rabie K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D9D749A2-650B-424D-8454-3B3DC9C2DE0B"><gtr:id>D9D749A2-650B-424D-8454-3B3DC9C2DE0B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Outage probability analysis of WPT systems with multiple-antenna access point</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e"><gtr:id>1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rabie K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BA176F85-768C-4A49-BE4C-57E80CF35E81"><gtr:id>BA176F85-768C-4A49-BE4C-57E80CF35E81</gtr:id><gtr:title>6LoPLC for smart grid applications</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792"><gtr:id>115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ikpehai A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E3DB0541-53CF-4288-9664-5B9502A01654"><gtr:id>E3DB0541-53CF-4288-9664-5B9502A01654</gtr:id><gtr:title>For More Energy-Efficient Dual-Hop DF Relaying Power-Line Communication Systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>IEEE Systems Journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e"><gtr:id>1338e9b1350225637065c8747264f34e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rabie K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/22635CA8-673C-443E-BFBB-E861F1C968E2"><gtr:id>22635CA8-673C-443E-BFBB-E861F1C968E2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Experimental Study of 6LoPLC for Home Energy Management Systems</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Energies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792"><gtr:id>115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ikpehai A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7DDE51CA-240E-447D-8B01-B8E92C3A3231"><gtr:id>7DDE51CA-240E-447D-8B01-B8E92C3A3231</gtr:id><gtr:title>Home energy management system over low-power narrowband PLC</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792"><gtr:id>115b14ce3285f63df3474b484d0d8792</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ikpehai A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M506758/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
