positive deviance approach to health programme management</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/M002675/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In sub-Saharan Africa, and in South Africa in particular, there are significant numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS. Increasingly, there are growing numbers of people who are also living with non-communicable disease such as diabetes and heart disease. Although HIV is infectious and diseases like diabetes are not, they share similarities in that they require lifelong management to ensure health. HIV treatment requires a consistent regimen of antiretroviral therapy (ART), while diabetes may require a change in diet as well as regular medication. For policy makers planning health care in South Africa, it is a big challenge to make sure that the state health system has a cost-effective plan to keep these people on treatment and accessing care throughout their lifetime. Although the South African government has made ART available free of charge, recent studies have indicated that many with HIV stop taking the drugs over time. This problem has worsened as the programme has expanded. This is dangerous for their health and is also worrying from a public health standpoint as it could lead to strains of the disease that are resistant to ART as well as increasing the chance of them passing the virus on. Significantly, some clinics dispensing ART have much higher rates of people continuing to pick up their treatment. This study aims to fill knowledge gaps about the factors that influence whether people stay in care, focusing on the ART programme in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The results of the research will help us work with policy makers in the Department of Health and leaders of community-based organisations to design a larger project that will involve implementing a country-wide programme to achieve more continuous care for people with chronic lifelong conditions. 

The study will involve researchers from different disciplines who are trained in medicine, the analysis of health systems and policies, social anthropology, public health and pharmacy. We will adopt a method that analyses existing numerical data monitoring how regularly people are collecting the ART drugs at clinics, and other HIV-related data. This will be used to identify which health facilities are performing better than others in terms of keeping people on treatment and engaged in their clinical care. We will focus our work on facilities serving poor populations who are socially marginalised. We will then go on to do more in-depth research in a few facilities which we have assessed as &amp;quot;good performers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;bad performers&amp;quot; respectively. We will look in more detail at the information about HIV care and also look at indicators of whether people with diabetes are staying in care, using diabetes as an example for non-communicable disease. We will also collect information by observing practices in clinics, and interviewing staff and patients. Interviews will be conducted with decision-makers in the provincial and national Departments of Health. We will investigate the reasons for differences in performance and identify constraints to positive performance. We suspect that the facilities that are managing to keep patients in care, have more innovative organisational practices and have in addition forged partnerships with community-based organisations. This can then help to better support people to take part in managing their chronic illness themselves as well. Such &amp;quot;self-management&amp;quot; is an important factor in poorer settings where the health system cannot provide intensive support from health professionals. We will identify generic factors that are helping to keep people on ART in care and that, if adopted more generally, could contribute to improving care for other chronic conditions also. We will have a workshop with the Department of Health and other stakeholders to discuss how the lessons learned can improve the programmes for chronic disease at national level. This will assist in the design of a bigger intervention and a further research proposal.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The objective of this proposal is to conduct an interdisciplinary qualitative and quantitative study to address knowledge gaps about retention in care in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) programme in Western Cape, South Africa. This will inform the design of a larger intervention project with stakeholders for improving implementation, at scale, for a national-level programme to achieve high levels of treatment for chronic lifelong conditions (CLLCs). This study will adopt a &amp;quot;positive deviance&amp;quot; approach for implementing health programmes by identifying facilities which are outliers and analysing constraints to good performance for retention in care. We hypothesise that good performance relies on partnerships between the formal health system and community organisations to support disease self-management. The study will address these questions:
- What are the most important factors contributing to good performance for retention in care for facilities that are positive deviants in the ART programme?
- What are the major constraints to similar performance in other localities and how could an intervention for disseminating lessons from positive deviants help stakeholders overcome them?
- Which generic factors from the ART programme could contribute to good performance for other CLLCs?
Phase 1 of the study involves desk-based validation of the central database for chronic medication distribution and the routine management data from facilities for HIV. Facilities will be mapped by typology and paired according to an analysis of good and bad performers for retention in care for ART. In Phase 2, facility-level studies will involve investigating the data for HIV and also diabetes, as a tracer condition for all NCD. Qualitative research will explore the reasons for differences between facilities. In Phase 3, data analysis will facilitate communication of lessons learned and Phase 4 will involve a workshop with stakeholders to design a large scale intervention for CLLCs.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This initial proposal has a number of direct beneficiaries, mainly within the HIV/AIDS community in the Western Cape. The project is also designed in such a way that it has the potential to inform further work with even wider beneficiary groups, both geographically and those with other chronic lifelong conditions (CLLCs), such as diabetes.

As is clear from the attached letter of support, this project would be implemented in collaboration with the National Department of Health in South Africa. The University of Western Cape is currently responding to a request of the Provincial Department of Health of the Western Cape to investigate the dispensing of chronic medication by a contracted pharmaceutical company. In the Western Cape, this distribution of medication, including ART, thus already exists, the users of which will be the ultimate beneficiaries of this research. Below is a list of beneficiaries and how they stand to benefit from this research:

* Low income populations in the Western Cape in need of ART: By identifying transferable factors in facilities with higher-than-average retention rates in ART, the expectation is that other facilities in the area will also be able to improve their retention rates. Ultimately this has the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of those living with HIV. Retaining HIV positive individuals in ART is critical in reducing further infections (treatment as prevention) as well as in limiting the evolution of ARV-resistant strains of the HI virus. This has potential economic benefits as well, allowing them to remain productive members of society while simultaneously reducing potential time and monetary costs associated with their care.

* Local facilities: Both facilities that are currently above-average performers and those who are below-average performers may benefit from findings about what factors contribute positively to ART retention rates. This could improve efficiency in ART distribution for the pharmacuetical distribution company, as well as the inconvenience to facilities of returning undelivered stock.

* Local community-based organisations (CBOs) and civil society organisations (CSOs): Local CBOs, patient advocacy groups and other CSOs - such as the Treatment Action Campaign, the Community Media Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres - will be included in the communication of findings from the proposed study. The hope is that they will be able to use that information to hold facilities to account and maintain pressure on them to implement relevant changes.

* Western Cape Department of Health: By improving the retention rate across facilities, the provincial Department of Health may benefit from greater efficiencies in the distribution of ART and less leakage within the current system. Greater adherence to ART may also reduce the rate of new HIV infections, which could have significant cost savings for the province across drugs, facilities and workforce.

Following this development study, should we be successful in acquiring further funding, we would hope that these benefits could be made on a wider scale, both geographically and in terms of other CLLCs. This is further articulated in the Impact Pathways section of this proposal. But to summarise, other provincial Departments of health, notably from the Eastern Cape, a resource-poor province, have expressed interest in research collaboration. At a national level, the Department of Health is currently being challenged to re-engineer primary care as part of its commitment to universal health coverage (UHC). Lessons from this study could inform the future design of national programmes to support people with a number of CLLCs, including diabetes and HIV/AIDS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72623</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Department of Health</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Improving performance for programmes for care of chronic lifelong conditions in South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:id>1750577A-AB8B-42E1-8E75-30D84A8F8CB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>IDS Policy Brief on mutual learning between BRICS countries led by Co-PI Dr Gerry Bloom.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Gerry Bloom engaged with Dr Yogan Pillay from the national HIV and TB programme around mutual learning between BRICS countries with respect to TB.

Discussions helped us shape the focus of the scoping study and we were given access to six facilities in the Western Cape and access to meetings with key decision-makers. Both departments gave letters of support as partners on the Development grant application and on the follow up application for a full grant, which was unsuccessful. We have continued the collaboration with the Western Cape Department of Health through Prof Boulle, who has a joint appointment in the Western Cape Department of Health and the University of Cape Town. In 2016 we conducted a health systems evaluation of the use of adherence clubs for chronic HIV care in the Western Cape and presented a written report to the Western Cape Department of Health. We presented the findings of the evaluation to stakeholders in the Department of Health in August 2016.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cape Town</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Public Health and Family Medicine</gtr:department><gtr:description>Health Systems components for scale up of the antiretroviral club model for retention of HIV positive patients in South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACFD43C3-2D62-4EF9-A36E-EEE53AC9E52C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We started the research for this work from late March 2016. We completed the work at the beginning of June and submitted a draft report to the department for feedback in September. We presented the findings in August 2016 and the final report was submitted in December 2016. Our report complements the epidemiological analysis that has been led by Prof Boulle, by contributing research material and analysis of the health system components required for successful scale up and diffusion of the antiretroviral club model in the Western Cape and beyond. The Gates Foundation is interested in analysis of how the model has been established in the Western Cape, what the conditions are that enhance sustainability of the intervention, and what aspects of the model are applicable for dissemination elsewhere in South Africa and other countries facing a similar burden. In South Africa there is interest from the Department of Health in the learning from this model for other chronic lifelong conditions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>In 2016 a proportion of the funding from an existing Gates Foundation grant has been allocated from University of Cape to the Institute of Development Studies. Following our discussions the collaborators at UCT have decided to include a health systems component in the research plan, which is focused on conditions that facilitate the scaling up of a intervention in the Western Cape to establish antiretroviral adherence clubs to improve retention in care for HIV. Hayley MacGregor at IDS led a team to do this work, which started in late March 2016, in collaboration with UCT and Andrew McKenzie (HPI Institute) and Tanya Jacobs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The collaboration started in June 2014 when we approached Prof Andrew Boulle (jointly appointed at Western Cape Department of Health and University of Cape Town) to assist us with the analysis of Western Cape provincial data for retention in care at facility level. This assisted in our selection of clinic sites for the scoping study research in the HSRI Development grant. We had conceptualised a 'positive deviance' approach and needed to identify clinics that were performing better with respect to quantitative indicators of retention in care. Hayley MacGregor remained in contact with Prof Boulle and discussed the emerging findings from the qualitative research in the scoping study as these related to epidemiological analysis of retention in care that he was conducting. In 2015 we decided to pursue formal research collaboration in the area of chronic lifelong conditions and retention in care. We submitted a full proposal to HSRI that was unsuccessful. University of Cape Town is the holder of a Gates Foundation grant (Andrew Boulle is PI) to examine conditions that would facilitate the scale up of an 'ARV club' model to improve retention in care for HIV. University of Cape Town subcontracted Institute of Development studies and our partners to do the health systems component of this work and we conducted and completed the work in 2016.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Health Partners International (HPI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Health Systems components for scale up of the antiretroviral club model for retention of HIV positive patients in South Africa</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8B96688-FBF2-4CD0-9D42-A59B3A37945C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The output of this collaboration has been a health system contribution to the report that UCT will prepare for the Gates Foundation.

This presentation of the scoping study findings sparked question and discussion about the study and generated engagement with key practitioners and policy makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference of Public Health Association of South Africa (Durban)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E650BE5-04CA-46DB-9DFB-8C99A42BDB80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ferdinand Mukumbang, the pre-doctoral student involved in the project at the University of Western Cape (by this stage a full doctoral student), presented the findings of the scoping study research with Prof Brian van Wyk, a research team member from UWC.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with Head of TB and HIV, National Department of Health and his deputies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>998B39F0-0397-44FC-9AEA-30F28132D770</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We had an initial meeting in Oct 2014 with the Head of HIV and TB for the national Department of Health, who was already a research partner in the Development grant and had engaged with Gerry Bloom in efforts to stimulate mutual learning between health policy-makers in BRICS countries.

This research started in August 2014 and completed in January 2015.

The grant funded a scoping study of the ART treatment programme in six facilities in Western Cape. We adopted a &amp;quot;positive deviance&amp;quot; approach with the aim of identifying factors contributing to substantially better performance by some facilities with respect to retention in care (RiC) for HIV: three pairs of facilities were matched according to the nature of the HIV programme in terms of patient numbers and services provided, and characteristics of the population served. One pair was in a rural district and the other two were in the urban Cape metro. All facilities served populations of low socio-economic status. Prof. Boulle from the Western Cape Department of Health (now a collaborator) assisted with analysis of province-wide data comparing facilities according to percentage of people retained in care during 2013. Facilities were paired with one of the pair having a higher percentage. 

At each facility the team organised two sub-studies: one on programme organisation (management, staffing, a facility &amp;quot;champion&amp;quot; for RiC, organisation of care, data entry and engagement with HMIS data, and adherence models) and another on community orientation of facilities (partnerships with NGOs and deployment of community health workers, the systems for tracing patients lost to care, decentralised drug distribution and adherence &amp;quot;clubs&amp;quot;). Methods included: mapping the organisation of care, staffing, and NGO partnerships; observation; and interviews with staff and with patients. The team also interviewed management staff at provincial, district and facility level to explore how the system works for RiC, their opinion about key components of the system, local innovations and ways to improve the system. We triangulated these perspectives with the observations at facility level. 

We found that it was difficult to identify facilities performing substantially better than others in terms of RiC on account of shortcomings of the health management information system and very little difference between facilities in RiC indicators. However, we identified focal innovation and minor differences in programme management. We also identified organisational and institutional factors that contributed to loss of people to care. We noted the potential value of the existing management tools in the HIV programme, although we observed that there was no facility where potential synergies between these management approaches were fully leveraged. These findings allowed us to identify factors that would enable the system to achieve higher levels of RiC and the barriers to good performance in terms of the following conceptual lenses: (1) system operation (such as programme performance and dynamic interaction of components, incentive structures, staff champions and staff attitudes, infrastructure, drug distribution) (2) management approaches and health information (such as roles and responsibilities of personnel, management legacy, management tools, HMIS); and (3) therapeutic partnership between facilities and patients (such as patient-provider interactions, community partnerships, patient tracing and care). Barriers and strategies for addressing them now merit further investigation in a future research proposal, using these conceptual lenses.

We found that facility managers were very concerned about several planned policy changes and the effect these might have on performance in the HIV programme. They said they were overwhelmed by responding to changes and providing services. Policy-makers at provincial level recognised that directives for improving the system are often not implemented as envisaged. It was noted that facilities rarely use monitoring and management data to improve services and that there is insufficient ownership of the programme at this level to encourage innovation beyond micro-experimentation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7EA7958E-FFD8-403C-94D9-A84AA1945C53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We used the research findings to engage with the National and Provincial Departments of Health and to discuss a potential future intervention to improve performance in programmes providing care and support for HIV positive people as well as patients with other chronic lifelong conditions.

Western Cape has published a vision for integrated Primary Health Care by 2030 and has made it a priority to address equity and improve care of people with non-communicable diseases substantially. It plans to adapt the management systems it created for ART for other chronic lifelong conditions (CLLCs). Our research and engagement with the Department of Health has aimed at contributing to this planning. The National DoH is publishing a white paper on national health insurance, developing policy and implementation plans for 'ideal' Primary Health Care clinics, and building outreach community care. These developments make the findings of this research very timely. The failure of health systems to respond to the increasing prevalence of CLLCs and provide effective care has had a deleterious impact on the health and livelihoods of the poor in South Africa and many LMICs. The findings of this study have provided an opportunity to engage in these discussions. 

We organised meetings with senior management in the Western Cape DoH and at national level. We concluded that the &amp;quot;ART Programme&amp;quot; is better viewed as a number of health system components that need to work together, rather than as an autonomous administrative entity, and that it is important to understand the complex context within which any intervention is implemented. This is important in the light of debates about whether to continue earmarked funds for HIV and the plans to provide similar levels of care and support to people with non-communicable diseases. Since we could not identify positive deviants from whom to learn &amp;quot;best practice approaches&amp;quot;, we agreed that the best strategy was to implement an organisational change intervention as a way of learning about the operation of the system, the major barriers to improvement and strategies for overcoming these barriers. This would involve finding ways to improve the performance of the ART programme and to extend this approach to cover people with diabetes, using modified versions of the available management tools and approaches. 

These conclusions formed the basis for a full proposal that was submitted to the HSRI scheme in 2015. This application was not successful in obtaining funding, but we are actively pursuing other funding possibilities. The collaboration with Andrew Boulle from the Western Cape DOH and UCT, and with Andrew McKenzie from HPI Institute, will continue as we collaborate at present in research on ARV clubs in the Western Cape and their role in retaining HIV positive patients in care.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Dataset from scoping  study research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We conducted and recorded interviews with the same range of health care providers in 14 health facilities, and with district and provincial level managers and practitioners.
