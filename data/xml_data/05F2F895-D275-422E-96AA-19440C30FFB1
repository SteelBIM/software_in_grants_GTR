Society</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L009099/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal is for a National Research Centre (WISERD/Civil Society) to undertake a five year programme of policy relevant research addressing Civil Society in Wales. Established in 2008, WISERD provides an 'All-Wales' focus for research and has had a major impact on the quantity and quality of social science research undertaken in Wales. As part of WISERD, WISERD/Civil Society will enable this work to be deepened and sustained through a focused research programme that further develops our research expertise, intensifies our policy impact and knowledge exchange work and strengthens our research capacity and career development activities. WISERD/Civil Society will therefore aim to develop key aspects of the multidisciplinary research initiated during the first phase of WISERD's work to produce new empirical evidence to inform our understanding of the changing nature of civil society in the context of devolved government and processes of profound social and economic change.
 
There are many disagreements over what civil society is and how it may be changing. We do know that over the last forty years there have been unprecedented changes in the spheres of economy and industry, politics and governance, social relations and individual life courses. How individuals in local contexts are affected by and respond to dramatic institutional changes is not well understood. An important gap in our knowledge is in describing and explaining the impact of social change on local forms of civil society and civil society organisations and what this means for social cohesion and well-being. In addition how different forms of civil society are developing in the context of multi-level and devolved government is not well understood. Because of its size and devolved government, Wales offers a unique context for studying these issues. Viewing Wales as a 'laboratory for social science' the proposed centre will build on existing networks of researchers who have a wide range of expertise and skills. Large survey data sets will be exploited and analysed and new data collected on civil society in Wales, the UK and Europe. Inter-disciplinarity and multi-method approaches applied to longitudinal and comparative data will be a key feature and strength of the WISERD/Civil Society research programme. Our research will be underpinned by three principles: (i) to maximise research impact, (ii) to become a centre of excellence for comparative, longitudinal, and relational research methods and (iii) to contribute to the growth of research capacity in Wales. We will also extend our research out from Wales to undertake comparative studies at different regional, national and international levels. In this way WISERD will make substantive and novel contributions to the advancement of social theory applied to researching contemporary civil society and to methodological approaches to describing and explaining patterns of civic participation in the context of devolution and multi-level governance. Substantive research will be applied to real and timely research problems conducted under four inter-related themes:

Locality, Community and Civil Society 
Individuals, Institutions and Governance 
Economic Austerity, Social Enterprise and Inequality 
Generation, Life Course and Social Participation

Our aim will be to produce a wide range of outputs accessible to a variety of different audiences, including: academic papers; books; working papers; seminars; web based material; video and e-learning materials; as well as disseminating our work through a diversity of activities. Public awareness will be raised through events; activities; and exhibitions, designed to foster interest and encourage discussion and debate. WISERD/Civil Society will have a strong management structure, substantial institutional support, and close links with relevant organisations, and will provide substantive career development for new and early-career researchers and PhD students.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
We will target four key beneficiary groups; (i) Researchers and research networks; (ii) Policy makers and national and local government; (iii) Third Sector and Civil Society Organisations and (iv) the General Public and Communities. 

How will they benefit?
Findings from the multidisciplinary research programme will advance knowledge and stimulate further research and debate across wide range of academics. We will create a rich and vibrant research environment, involving networks of national and international academics, with a strategy to disseminate research and knowledge as widely as possible by means of a series of targeted events, published outputs and the use of social and digital media. We will make a rich set of new data available to the academic community. We will implement a five year career development programme aimed at newly appointed researchers and established investigators within WISERD/Civil Society participating institutions. We will establish a network to bring researchers together from the four UK nations focusing on devolution and civil society. Specific research capacity activities will include three grant-linked PhD studentships and, in collaboration with the Wales DTC &amp;amp; the White Rose DTC, a substantial cohort of further funded studentships. Early and mid-career researchers will be given responsibility for work packages with mentoring and support from senior researchers. Our international links will provide advanced and specialist training for staff and academics in the thematic networks. We will provide strong web-based engagement and dissemination and e-learning opportunities across a wide range of levels from secondary schools to advanced postgraduate training and specialist teaching. All new and early-career researchers will be expected to contribute to planning meetings, seminars and joint Seminars with Government departments. Where events and seminars and publications are being planned new researchers will be partnered with senior researchers to deliver outputs as part of a research management development plan. We will organise reciprocal internships and placements for programme staff in civil society organisations and the Welsh Government. Policy actors will therefore benefit from access to the research process (planning; interpretation of findings; and access to data for further research) and from access to preliminary research findings. In close collaboration with the new Public Policy Institute for Wales we will inform Welsh Government priority areas from a civil society perspective. A comprehensive impact strategy will range from programme level events and activities (conferences, seminar series, training courses) undertaken on a rolling annual basis to key impact targets for each of the individual work packages within the research themes (including research and policy output workshops, web based and social media dissemination and public engagement activities) to be delivered within defined timescales. Third sector and private organisations will benefit from a clearer understanding of how their work is related to wider aspects of civil society and forms of social capital. This will lead to an increased focus on evidence and will inform and improve plans to deliver services more effectively and efficiently and to work more closely with the social enterprise sector. We will also work with third sector organisations and groups to develop learning opportunities particularly within policy research, comparative research and analysis of Welsh data. Through our emphasis on user involvement, engagement and co-production the public and communities will benefit from an independent and challenging research programme, focused on the social outcomes of civil society processes, that produces evidence on the inter-relationships between individuals and institutions, and disseminates that evidence back to the general public in diverse and usable formats.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>6208655</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>With ESRC Impact Acceleration Account money we have produced two short films (8 and 5 minutes) with young people discussing our findings.

Delegates were invited to attend a variety of sessions, with themes including housing policy and devolution, health and wellbeing, the Welsh homelessness service, vulnerable 
groups, and the private rented sector. The diversity of topics highlighted how significantly the study of housing crosses over into other areas of research. 

WISERD Director Prof Ian Rees Jones chaired the event

Shelter Cymru launched their Welsh homelessness legislation report, 'Reasonable Steps: Experiences of Homelessness Services Under the Housing (Wales) Act 2014'. Peer Researcher, Mr Alex Osmond, shared his own experiences of homelessness services, as well as his findings on those of other service users.

Guest plenary speaker Professor Kenneth Gibb, University of Glasgow, provided an insight into housing policy in a devolved Scotland and raised the question of whether they are experiencing constrained autonomy or opportunity. 

Mr Steffan Evans, PHD student, Cardiff University, shared his findings on how social housing regulation differs between Wales and England.

Dr Jennifer Hoolachan, Cardiff University talked about 'The Private Housing (Tenancies) (Scotland) Act 2016' and its implications for private renters. As part of this discussion, she raised the important distinction between 'home' and 'housing', emphasising that these are not the same thing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/news/latest-news/wales-housing-research-conference-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Sioned Pearce 08.04.2016 - Blog: Young EU supporters are more likely to turnout on the day.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E074B3B5-C969-44AD-BF9D-D7A2FC331669</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog in the run-up to EU referendum, the finding was also presented in a Channel 4 News interview in April 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/wiserd/2016/04/08/young-eu-supporters-are-more-likely-to-turnout-on-the-day/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Paul Chaney 30.09.2015 - Meeting with Deputy Director of National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>046E4E6F-0D68-4E3B-89DE-23EE3E933DFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results of the meeting 30.09.15 between Paul Chaney and Deputy Director of National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement included knowledge exchange and plans for future co-working / engagement training for WISERD researchers.

The presentation outlined the key findings on these pathways from secondary analysis that may be of most benefit and utility to the third sector as they face continuing challenges.

Dr Wil Chivers - The presentation outlined research I am currently involved with for WISERD Civil Society based around the theoretical and methodological aspects of the relationship between social media and civil society. The presentation generated some lively discussion about the tools for social media analysis and some of the conceptual and ethical dimensions of carrying out this kind of research.

Dr Helen Blakely (WP3.3) - The presentation outlined the work being undertaken on work package 3.3. (Trade Unions, Associational LIfe and Well Being) of the Civil Society Programme. The presentation sparked interesting questions and discussion around the nature of trade unions both in the UK and China, and built the foundations for further engagement with colleagues working on this area within the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wil Chivers Nov 2015 - WISERD Civil Society: Blog post entitled 'A 'Mature Debate' on Communications Surveillance?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5D2B118-019A-49D1-8BBD-3E58CB97B136</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This blog post was intended to raise awareness of WISERD's work as a research centre.

Specifically, Professor Chaney presented a paper exploring the challenges in maintaining and supporting the democratic participation of civil society organisations (CSOs) in order to uphold human rights for children and young people in six North African countries. This geographical focus was selected because states across the region languish in the bottom third of global human rights rankings. In the face of continuing abuses, the need to engage non-state actors in human rights implementation has never been more important. The study highlighted the contingent nature of civil society engagement, agency and activism and how, in turn, these are shaped by issues of democracy, civil conflict and political stability. In presenting its findings the paper challenges accepted thinking associated with 'transitology' and reveals key pathologies affecting the contemporary implementation of children's rights across the region. http://www.ncvo.org.uk/training-and-events/research-conference</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Ian Jones (WP 2.4) 05.05.16 Cardiff - WISERD Civil Society Seminar - Measuring Trust and Transparency: Exploring a Mixed Methods Approach.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B1F54565-F2AB-4526-B237-0EC76117FD14</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This presentation examined the approaches adopted within existing research on civil society and other sectors - to measuring trust and transparency and the extent to which a mixed methods approach can offer an effective approach to exploring the interplay between trust and transparency.

These were compared and contrasted with the findings of their first-stage project interviews with elites working in these areas in Wales. Key themes that emerged from the discussion were the diverse ways in which both sectors influence and deepen the identities of young people, juxtaposed by the lack of explicit attention to the role of these sectors in promoting Welsh identity. Despite the extent of developments since 1999, amongst the policy relevant findings were questions regarding whether the process of implementing the Donaldson recommendations would achieve the Welsh Government's aims of exposing young people to a more distinctive Welsh identity and the implications of evaluation indicators on how the non-statutory organisations' engage with young people.

The meeting was an opportunity for knowledge exchange - it heard research updates from academics and practitioners on current and upcoming work spanning diverse fields such as architecture, design, economics, geography, health, housing and homelessness policy, law, planning, psychology, and sociology. The topics discussed included: housing research and 'big data' analysis, developments in homeless legislation, housing provision for those fleeing domestic abuse, housing policy and Black and minority ethnic communities - as well as housing pathways for older people.

The seminar was presented by Visiting International Fellow Professor Sahoo Sarbeswar of the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. The seminar examines how Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), as part of civil society, contribute towards democratization in India and what conditions facilitate or inhibit their contribution. On the basis of in-depth empirical analysis and comparative case studies of three developmental NGOs that work among the tribal communities in the socio-historical context of south Rajasthan, this seminar assesses three different kinds of politics within civil society - liberal pluralist, neo-Marxist, and communitarian - which have had different implications in relation to democratization. Based on these three cases, the discussion demonstrates that civil society is not necessarily a democratizing force; it can have contradictory consequences in relation to democratization. The democratizing effect of civil society is not a result of the &amp;quot;stock of social capital&amp;quot; in the community, but is contingent upon the kinds of ideologies and interests that are present or ascendant not just within the institutions of civil society but also within the state. The analysis thus, presents a nuanced understanding of civil society's capacity to influence democratization in the developing world.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/news/latest-news/visiting-international-fellow-presents-wiserd-seminar-civil-society-and-democratization-india</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UNASSIGNED as already reported by Stuart Fox - Dr Sioned Pearce 23.05.16 - SciScreen public debate - Cardiff</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB662837-2E6F-4F28-8610-4C0C7BFF712A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Took part in a debate on the EU referendum following a film screening of Brexit the movie for the general public.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Helen Blakely (WP3.3) 22.11.16 - WISERD Blog: Strike; Remembering and Rememberance in the Labour Movement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>11F57B56-50E6-46B5-B0C2-8FA21ECFD2C9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog to engage stakeholders interested in unions and unionisation and to raise their awareness of the work in this area being carried out through the WISERD Civil Society grant.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://blogs.cardiff.ac.uk/wiserd/2016/11/22/strike/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Paul Chaney 06.04.16 - Research collaboration GW4 social protection, Cardiff.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CEEE51A7-EF2C-486C-A6E3-6E363ABCC97D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Paul Chaney, 06th April 2016, research collaboration GW4 social protection, day workshop involving research planning / collaboration between Cardiff, Exeter and Bath University and practitioners, third sector.

The team presented the fieldwork undertaken at their research site, the village of Rhosllanerchrugog (&amp;quot;Rhos&amp;quot;) within the local authority of Wrexham Borough Council. The village provides an interesting site for exploring continuity and change in local civil society with its rich history of associations linked to religion, the Welsh Language and employment in heavy industry.
The presentation focused on one key emerging finding to do with the way some community groups and institutions have evolved over time in quite significant ways. In some cases the personnel involved in community groups has remained constant; in other groups they have been succeeded by new personnel. A good case study illustration of this is the village bowling club.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.wiserd.ac.uk/news/latest-news/wiserd-civil-society-seminar-bowling-together-civil-society-north-east-wales-village/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Stephen Drinkwater (WP1.3) November 2016 - 'EU migrant workers in the UK: Past, Present and Future' at the University of Roehampton's Brexit Seminar Series</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92033259-F6D8-4792-B3E0-DFED4B43939E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Around 30 academics, post-graduate and under-graduate students (mainly from the social sciences) attended this presentation. The presentation was part of Roehampton's Brexit seminar series, which has included talks on a wide range of topics related to Brexit. The focus of this particular presentation was on EU migrant workers in the UK and how their numbers and job characteristics have evolved, particularly since the 2004 Enlargement when EUA8 countries joined. This is related to the Civil Society work package that looks at civic participation of EUA8 migrants and as such highlighted some of the background analysis that has been undertaken on the work package. The main purpose was to provide information on an important Brexit-related topic and to disseminate some of the latest research and findings. It is hoped that in addition to enhancing the knowledge of those present at the seminar that it may lead to further connections for ongoing research in related areas of migration.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof Ian Jones (2016/17) Bangor University School of Social Sciences Research Seminar Series</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C8D1C200-D5F5-4549-8E1F-02068346F81B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>WISERD Civil Society organised Seminar Series hosted by Bangor University School of Social Sciences.

opportunity to engage with policy makers, professional practitioners and the general public with the University's flagship engagement projects, as well as a series of pilot projects, funded by the City Region Exchange, that explore new ways of working in the region. We showcased the REACH2XL pilot engagement project which, in partnership with Cardiff Council and Communities First, is helping young people in Butetown, Riverside and Grangetown in Cardiff to develop the skills, knowledge and confidence needed to access and thrive in further education. As part of a new, community-based approach to widening participation, the young people themselves are taking an active role in designing the support services they need. The event enabled us to show what can be done, but also sparked new ideas to strengthen our engagement with communities (for example, working in collaboration with other Cardiff University City Region pilot engagement projects and flagship programmes and new pathways for recruiting participants).

18 people attended a one-day workshop and the audience consisted of academic researchers from local universities, researchers from the Welsh Government and third sector organisations. The day consisted of two parts: in the morning a general overview of using social media in social research, an outline of current research that has used social media, the ethical implications of using social media and in the afternoon, a practical session demonstrating and allowing attendees to practice with two pieces of software for conducting social media data collection and analysis (COSMOS and NodeXL). Feedback was received following the event and was very positive; the content of the sessions was found to helpful and informative and the chance to experiment with the software was very much enjoyed. There appears to be an appetite for a similar event in 2017, which may take the form of a repeat event at another location or a follow-up session looking at some of the software/tools in more detail. The event has also resulted in establishing new contacts in the Welsh Government who I will be meeting in November to discuss their intended use of social media research methods.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/training-and-events/event/wiserd-tcb-event-using-social-media-social-research/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Prof Paul Chaney 2015 - Presentation at British Academy Review - Wales: Civil society Progress on equality, human rights and social justice?

The seminar consisted of two 3-hour sessions: In the first session, SPSS syntax code was introduced, focusing on creating and recoding data, performing basic analyses, and using SPSS' &amp;quot;do repeat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;loop&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;vector&amp;quot; commands to perform repetitive processing. In the second session, the equivalent Stata/.do syntax codes for creating and recoding data were introduced, and useful commands not available in SPSS were highlighted. The three key programming constructs for repetitive processing were discussed.

a joint training event that was of particular interest to participants from the Welsh Government, Office for National Statistics (ONS), key public agencies, civil society organisations, charities, think tanks, political practitioners, early-career researchers and students. Topic based roundtable sessions enabled participants with a common interest to discuss how the study can help examine questions on health, education, families and children, poverty/inequality and civil society and test research ideas.

Dr Nicole Martin/Dr Ricky Kanabar/Dr Alita Nandi ran the training sessions

The Wales Government, Westminster Government and UK Research Councils are all encouraging social science researchers to use existing sources of data, such as large scale survey data, bespoke survey data, administrative data and data collected by university researchers. One issue with using these data is a lack of knowledge of what data are available, whether it is fit for the purpose of the proposed research, and how to access the data. The WISERD Dataportal has been designed to make answering some of these questions easier by proving access to meta-data on a wide variety of data sets.

As well as providing access to meta-data, where possible the WISERD Data Portal also provides access to existing data through various APIs, such as the NOMIS API. Thus far the software has been developed with a focus on data relating to Wales.
