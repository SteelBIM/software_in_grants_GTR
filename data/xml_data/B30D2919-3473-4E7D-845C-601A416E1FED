Although Gordon Childe introduced Tripillye to mainstream Western archaeology in the 1920s, the publication of most site monographs and articles in local languages has limited knowledge and the impact of Tripillyan discoveries to a small group of specialists. This has led to the neglect of the most striking aspect of Tripillyan practices - the development of a series of mega-sites, covering 200 - 450 ha, which are the largest sites in 4th millennium Europe and as large as the Early Bronze Age city of Uruk (Mesopotamia). \n The sheer size of these 'mega-sites' not only prompts questions of the complexity of social structure(s) necessary to sustain such settlements, and the logistics and long-term planning needed to provision them but also makes them very hard to investigate. After 2 decades of excavation, Ukrainian colleagues are currently unable to sequence the houses on a single mega-site by scientific dating, preventing us from working out the population size at any given phase of the site occupation and hindering attempts to elucidate the sequence of mega-site growth, floruit and collapse. Currently, we can neither place mega-sites in a micro-regional or regional settlement context nor understand their human impact on the forest steppe landscape. \n Our response to these research issues was the creation of an inter-disciplinary research project, jointly organised by Durham University (Chapman) and the Kyiv Institute of Archaeology (Videiko). Our preliminary summer 2009 field season enabled a field test of the methods proposed to understand the 250-ha. mega-site of Nebelivka, midway between Kyiv and Odessa. Geophysical prospection of 15ha of the site enabled the recognition of over 60 burnt structures in rows or streets, 18 of which were sampled by hand coring to depths of 0.80m to extract burnt house daub. The plant remains inserted into the daub can be directly dated by the AMS method, thereby providing a timeline for each individual houses. The aim is to recover 100 AMS dates from different parts of Nebelivka, enabling a sequencing of the whole settlement and the modelling of mega-site growth. Excavation of one complete burnt Tripillye house by the Ukrainian team in 2009 provided comparable 14C samples of other materials (bone, seeds, pottery). Initial fieldwalking in the environs of Nebelivka suggests that the land near the mega-site may have been devoted to cultivation; but much more fieldwalking in a 10-km radius is needed to provide insights into the nature of the local settlement structures and their social meanings. Peat deposits were identified to provide a regional vegetation history, with which to compare the local histories of mega-site environmental impact as recorded in nearby alluvial sequences. These fieldwork strategies will be enhanced by the analysis of satellite imagery to assess the amount of disturbance to mega-sites through earth-moving; the existence of crop-mark sites within the Nebelivka micro-region; and the variability in mega-site plans through time and across the whole Tripillye distribution. \n The research strategy of focussing on three different spatial levels - site, micro-region and macro-region - provides a platform for the integration and interpretation of much fresh data which has a high potential for answering the three crucial issues raised by Tripillye mega-sites: what are the details of a well-sequenced mega-site?; how was the provisioning of such large sites managed across the landscape?; and can we detect a trajectory towards local, European urbanism?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main area in which the project has the potential for major impact outside the archaeological sector is the cultural sector. Five initiatives are proposed: the project would be seeking to engage interested but non-specialist members of the general public, whether in the UK, Ukraine or in other countries. \n\n(1) Press releases at regular intervals in the Times, the Guardian and Ukrainian national newspapers (2011 - 2015): aim - ensure coverage of the project in national media. \n\n(2)Project web-site (2011 - 2015): aim - keep interested public and professionals up-to-date with the most recent project results. \n\n(3) touring exhibition of display panels in eight museums in Ukraine (Kyiv, Ivano-Frankivsk, Galych, Zaporozhya, Odessa, Donetsk, Vinnytza and Kharkiv) in 2014, with a European itinerary of eight museums in 2015 (Chishinau; Piatra Neamt, Varna, Budapest, Krakow, Mannheim, Oxford and Durham): aim - dissemination of results to museum colleagues and general public in Ukraine and other European countries. \n\n(4) general book written at the end of the project to coincide with the touring exhibition (2015): aim - dissemination of most important project results to general audience. \n\nIt is highly desirable to make an impact on Ukrainian and UK culture by providing a clearer idea of prehistoric social evolution in general and the contribution of the Eastern European Tripillye culture in particular. Participants in the museum activities will gain transferable skills for future media use, as well as presentational skills in the preparation of web-sites and exhibition panels.\n\nThere is wide range of expert advice available in-house for the travelling exhibition. Those teaching on the Durham Masters in Museum and Artefact Studies have provided advice on the planning of touring exhibitions. The professional exhibition designer, Ms. Christina Unwin, has a wide range of experience of communicating complex messages in approachable ways.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>635953</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute of Archaeology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ukraine</gtr:country><gtr:department>Prehistory Section</gtr:department><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Early urbanism in Europe?&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>AC61D886-26A5-4C90-B53D-9826398A066B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications and two conferences to come</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Our partners organise the official Ukrainian State permits for our work, organise the summer season's accommodation in the local village and facilitate post-excavation study visits to Kiev and to Kirovograd.

Invited guests included the Governor of Kirovograd County, his Cultural Heritage staff and over 100 school-children, as well as staff and students from Kirovograd University. The aim was to demonstrate the European significance of the Trypillia mega-sites of the 4th millennium BC and to prepare a base for future political work on the declaration / preservation of these sites as national monuments. During the Conference, there was the opening ceremony of the Project's International Travelling Exhibition - 'Trypillia Mega-sites - which remained open in Kirovograd Museum of History for 1 month. After 1 1/2 days of professional papers on heritage and Trypillia mega-sites, the conference moved to the village of Nebelivka to see the experimental burning of a 'Neolithic' look-alike house. In addition to the scientific merit of this experiment, it was important to demonstrate the high level of interest at County level to the village mayor and the villagers themselves. A second version of the Travelling Exhibition was then opened in Nebelivka village and remains there as the basis for future cultural tourism.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation about the Trypillia mega-site Project, International Conference, University of SUNY-Buffalo, USA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>726950E0-ADD7-441F-8DB7-043969811D88</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Project Post-Doctoral Research Assistant, Dr. Bisserka Gaydarska, was invited to present at the Conference, in SUNY - Buffalo, on 31st March - 3rd April 2016.The conference was entitled: &amp;quot;Coming together; comparative approaches to population aggregation and early urbanisation&amp;quot;.

The title of the Conference was 'FIRST CITIES' - AN EXPLORATION OF EARLY CITIES IN EUROPE AND ASIA' (aka 'A Tale of Trypillia Cities'; 'Prehistoric Poleis'; 'Wrong Time, Wrong Place')

There has been a loss of nerve in studies of early urbanism, with an inability to define the term leading to an analytical paralysis which has stopped archaeologists from making a strong contribution to global narratives of cultural change. Can we change this state of affairs? How can we best transcend Gordon Childe's criteria for urban sites which still, often implicitly, dominate the urbanism agenda? Will low-density urbanism, as proposed by Roland Fletcher, make a distinctive contribution? And what is the status of the very large, if rather undifferentiated, Trypillia mega-sites of Ukraine - the largest sites in 4th millennium BC Europe, if not the world? 

This conference aims to bring together some of the key thinkers in recent urbanism studies to define a new agenda for urbanism and to assess the contribution of the Trypillia mega-sites to this emergent debate.

Session abstract:
Places of congregation have a long prehistory, beginning with the seasonal aggregation sites of hunter-gatherers in times of plenty, continuing with monumental places or places of special deposition with no obvious monumentality and reaching recent and modern examples of pilgrimage and seasonal rock festivals. Is there anything that TAG delegates can learn from a discussion of such a diverse group of sites? 

While speakers have been selected for the diversity of their material - from G&amp;ouml;bekli Tepe in Anatolia to the Burning Man Festival in Nevada - we assume some communalities between the sites which underpin the possibility of asking generic questions about the phenomenon. The communalities include the basic idea of a special site of supra-local significance, which brought together people who were not usually meeting on a regular basis - in C. P. Snow's phrase, 'strangers and brothers/sisters'. These meetings may have started out with a principal function in mind but evolved into a suite of multi-purpose practices (think the debate on N.W. European causewayed enclosures; or how did seasonal gatherings morph into ritual congregations?). 

The generic questions arising out of these communalities are many and various, but include their origins (in many cases, there may well not have been a prior model - but perhaps prior ritual places / landscapes linked through long-term memory?); the temporal and spatial scale of gathering (did these places include a residential component ?) and movement (how far did people travel to such places?); of great importance - to what extent did these places and practices have a transformative effect on the participating communities?; can we identify material entanglements that developed at these places (were there emergent novel agencies for objects and places?; what were the unexpected outcomes to such meetings). 
The aim of this discussion is to make connections between classes of sites, between remote times and places, that had not been brought into relations before and to use the theme of congregation to investigate cultural change in particular contexts but also on a broader scale. Places and practices of interest for this theme include: forager fission-fusion cycles, G&amp;ouml;bekli Tepe, Glastonbury &amp;amp; Burning Man, Cycladic Bronze Age congregation sites, Trypillia mega-sites, Avebury, Cahokia, the hadj, Early Medieval Scandinavian gathering places.

(2) we have interpreted the mega-sites in a very different manner from those of earlier investigations, characterising these sites as low-density urban settlements;
(3) we have completed the first and, as yet, only complete geophysical plan of a mega-site (Nebelivka, 236 ha), using this plan to deepen our understanding of the spatial order on this huge site;
(4) we have completed the pollen and charcoal analysis of a core from very close to the mega-site, thus providing the first well-dated record of the human impacts caused by a mega-site. The discovery of surprisingly little impact has fed into our alternative interpretation of mega-sites as seasonal settlements;
(5) we are close to completing the first well-dated internal sequence of building phases at a mega-site, supported by 90 AMS dates;
(6) we have completed the only intensive, systematic programme of fieldwalking in the entire Trypillia distribution, allowing us to create a long-term sequence of settlement and land-use.regional</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Project findings may be used in future re-assessments of the path to urban settlement; the Trypillia mega-sites are as large, and as early, as the earliest Near Eastern urban centres and have hardly ever been considered within the high-level urban narrative.
