Studying development of coarticulation contributes to understanding the emergence of the system of organised motor skills required for a given language. No studies comparing lingual coarticulation in preadolescents and adults have been reported, although it has been shown in studies of lip and jaw movement that development of the control of speech movements continues even during adolescence. The present study aims to provide articulatory and acoustic data on lingual coarticulation, including the probable limits of variation acceptable for preadolescents with non-disordered speech motor skills.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study aims to elucidate the cause for changes in within-speaker variability with age, and to reveal how cross-segment differences in coarticulation develop in preadolescence. All participants will be native speakers of Standard Scottish English. There will be two groups, late primary school children and adults, with fifteen participants in each group. Each participant will produce target words in a carrier phrase, repeated six times. Ultrasound data on midsagittal tongue contours, synchronised with acoustic data, will be recorded and analysed. A new dynamic measure of coarticulation, based on the data from high-speed ultrasound imaging, will be introduced and refined.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>80674</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk (Munich, Germany), Coarticulation development: evidence from ultrasound tongue imaging</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F78047AE-9E01-44B0-ABD4-5100ADB839F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk by Natalia Zharkova at the weekly post-doctoral/doctoral research seminar series, the Institute of Phonetics, Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich, Munich, 9 February 2012.

The project used high-speed ultrasound to measure lingual coarticulation in the syllables &amp;quot;she&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;shah&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sea&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Sah&amp;quot;, comparing preadolescent children (ie 10-12-year-olds) and adults, fifteen speakers in each age group. A database of synchronised ultrasound tongue video and audio signals was collected.



In both age groups and both consonants, the tongue position at mid-consonant was affected by the identity of the following vowel. There was no significant effect of age on the size of the vowel-related difference in tongue posture, nor on within-speaker variability in tongue placement. Age-related differences were observed in the onset of coarticulation. While in the adults, the vowel effect was present throughout the consonant for both consonants, in preadolescents the effect was apparent later into the first half of the consonant. The results of the study suggest a near-adult-like achievement in the development of lingual control by preadolescents, with respect to the coarticulation of fricative-vowel sequences. However age-related differences in timing may indicate that preadolescents have still to gain the extent of forward planning in speech production which is possible for a typical adult.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- The database collected during the project is freely available to academics and students (http://edata.qmu.ac.uk/14/)
