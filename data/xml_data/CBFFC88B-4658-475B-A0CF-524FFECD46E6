Their demand is dramatically increasing and in 2013, 299 megatonnes of plastics were produced worldwide, a 46.5% increase compared to 2002 (source: plasticseurope). However, polymers are regarded as unsustainable as they are environmentally persistent and their production is dependent on finite fossil-based resources. In 2013, 99.5% of plastics were still produced from oil (source: europeanbioplastics). There is therefore an urgent need for further research into the production of sustainable plastics.

Additionally, in 2014, 32.3 gigatonnes of waste carbon dioxide (CO2) were released into the atmosphere (source: International Energy Agency). Therefore, polymers made from a cheap and renewable resource like CO2 are highly desirable products. 

The aim of this proposal is to utilise CO2 as a raw material in the synthesis of cyclic carbonate monomers, which are the building blocks of polycarbonate polymers. Polycarbonates are furthermore promising materials for numerous applications, including as thermoplastics, binders for photovoltaics, polymer electrolytes, adhesives, tissue engineering scaffolds and drug delivery carriers.

The current method used to produce cyclic carbonate monomers employs phosgene, a toxic and energy intensive reagent. Replacing phosgene by CO2 is an exciting scientific challenge that has the potential to transform the economy and impact the environment. Building on our published preliminary results and using an experimental and computational approach, this project will develop catalysts for the synthesis of cyclic carbonate monomers directly from CO2 and diols, abundant molecules that can be sourced from nature. These catalysts will ultimately be used to transform carbohydrates from biomass and food waste into new monomers that cannot be accessed using traditional phosgene reagents. This process will provide a vital step towards the valorisation of CO2 and the derivatisation of renewable feedstock like carbohydrates into novel sustainable materials that could generate significant wealth within the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit many stakeholders by meeting the urgent requirements of CO2 utilisation and providing a safe route towards novel sustainable polymer architectures.

Exploiting waste CO2 and sugars to form essential monomers for the creation of sustainable novel materials will positively impact on the UK's economic, environmental, research and industrial agendas in the medium and long term.
 
A safe and environmentally benign method to access cyclic monomers and sustainable polymeric materials will not only serve the synthetic chemistry community, but will help to advance materials and biomedical sciences too. In particular the health sector will benefit from new polycarbonate materials that have displayed promising properties as drug delivery systems and supports for tissue engineering, and that could dramatically improve our quality of life.
 
There is a high consumer demand for useful bio-based plastics for niche applications, including portable electronics. The project could generate new products and companies focusing on the derivatisation of food waste and biomass to produce high-value advanced monomers and polymers, which would create a significant amount of wealth.

Our research will lead to the improvement of existing processes that currently use phosgene derivatives. Replacing this hazardous chemical by CO2, a non-toxic waste from many industries, will have a positive impact on the environment by reducing the energy consumption associated with the production of phosgene, and by marginally contributing to greenhouse gas emission mitigation. This will also make the plastic industry a safer and less polluting working environment. Additionally, the environmental impact of our research will include the development of monomers for commodity and speciality polymers that are biodegradable thanks to a carbohydrate backbone.

Finally, this project will be an excellent opportunity to showcase how physical sciences can address environmental and societal problems. The recycling of waste CO2 gas, reusing food waste and the production of degradable polymers are all areas that capture the public interest and support. This interest will allow the PI to further engage the general public and young audiences in the concept of sustainability and raise the awareness of the potential of physical sciences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99198</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A collaboration was initiated with local artist Fiona Haines and the resulting artwork was exposed at the Bath Fringe festival and will tour Bath and North East Somerset district in 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAC57CA1-7328-43CD-9F7E-757F8C089730</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Engagement of the art community with research.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Expression of Research</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/research/news/2016/11/16/expressions-of-research/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Carbon dioxide Utilisation conference (Sheffield)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A001974-D487-43BF-AF4C-E7C49210EE0E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk at the International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Utilisation organised in Sheffield by CO2Chem network, in september 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk (Notthingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C36031D-2418-474F-9F70-D005AF138512</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited talk at a workshop in Green Chemistry organised by the CDT in Green chemistry of the University of Nottingham (December 2016).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bath Science and Policy event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A6C79AD-4FCA-43B1-91D1-94B72113FCDB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event was a public debate and Q&amp;amp;A session, free to attend, about the interaction between science and policy, in relation to the current political landscape and in relation with environmental issues like CO2 emissions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co2 utilisation-based Undergraduate lab experiment</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C07B988-2582-4946-9AB8-65D1E1B9C9F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on our research, we have designed and implemented a 3rd year laboratory experiment showcasing CO2 utilisation catalytic reactions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>7500</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Researcher Mobility Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2018-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Royal Society of Chemistry</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D51B86EF-F074-4972-8D1B-B2208A8A1675</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a new method that allows the direct coupling of diols with CO2 to produce cyclic carbonate monomers for polymerisation, without the use of phosgene derivatives, the toxic reagents traditionnally used. This process furthermore works under very mild conditions (ambient temperature and low pressure of CO2).
Through the research funded by this grant, we have improved our previously developed method into a partially catalytic system, hence using less costly reagents.
We are still working towards a more efficient and fully catalytic process, one that would use the minimum amount of reagents to perform the coupling of CO2 and diols.
Finally, using this method, we have been able to produce new monomers made from CO2 and sugar derivatives. These monomers have produced entirely novel renewable and degradable materials.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The publicattions resulting from this grant have already attracted a lot of attention from the sustainable polymer and carbon dioxide utilisation community.
We are aware of two groups (one in the US, one is Saudi Arabia) that are currently using our published method for the synthesis of new monomers using CO2.

The new materials we have been able to produce using CO2 (in particular with sugars) have been of interest to tissue engineering/drug delivery research and we have initiated work on this aspect with collaborators, specialist of the medical applications of biopolymers.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7692EB03-253A-49C0-99EE-1C182C63B508</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B3C489BC-9E8A-4176-9BF8-2F4D6E2BADAD"><gtr:id>B3C489BC-9E8A-4176-9BF8-2F4D6E2BADAD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Polymers from sugars: cyclic monomer synthesis, ring-opening polymerisation, material properties and applications.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/475ba8bbb15afa4b37dbb1b979750417"><gtr:id>475ba8bbb15afa4b37dbb1b979750417</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gregory GL</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1359-7345</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8A997A2E-1073-447B-B691-F9D24AF15793"><gtr:id>8A997A2E-1073-447B-B691-F9D24AF15793</gtr:id><gtr:title>CO2-Driven stereochemical inversion of sugars to create thymidine-based polycarbonates by ring-opening polymerisation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Polym.
