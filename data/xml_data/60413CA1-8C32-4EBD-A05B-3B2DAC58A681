Currently, HPV vaccines are recommended for use among sexually unexperienced women, typically young girls aged 14 years or younger, leaving a huge female population unprotected and at risk of developing cervical cancer and other HPV related diseases (genital warts, other genital &amp;amp; oropharyngeal cancers), for which few affordable and implementable screening options are available in resource-poor settings. The HPV vaccines afford high protection against the types they target, with some element of cross-protection against other genotypes, but it is assumed that no protection is offered if subjects have been infected by a vaccine type.

HIV+ women are at increased risk of acquisition and persistence of HPV leading on to the development of cervical cancer and other genital disease. We have conducted a study (called HARP) evaluating the performance of cervical cancer screening strategies among 1200 HIV+ women in South Africa (SA) and Burkina Faso (BF), which included HPV screening. We have found a huge burden of cervical precancer lesions (20% in SA, 5% on BF) and of high-risk HPV infection (&amp;gt;70% in SA, 55% in BF). We have recorded a good performance of HPV testing alone or in combination with cytology to detect these lesions. We would like to build upon this rich data source and the successful implementation of this study through the development of a clinical trial platform to develop the next phase of HARP, which will centre on the role of HPV control through screening and vaccination. We propose to develop a proposal for a randomised trial of HPV vaccination among HIV+ women to prevent cervical cancer lesions. There is currently no data on the efficacy of an HPV vaccine among HIV+ women, although a few trials have shown the safety and immunogenicity of the bivalent HPV vaccine in HIV+ populations, including one trial among SA women. The recent announcement by the SA government of the introduction of HPV vaccination countrywide offers the opportunity to explore the role of HPV vaccination in various sub groups.

The proposed study, in preparation of the vaccine trial, will assess the potential effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination embedded in an HPV screening programme in reducing the incidence of HPV-related infection and disease (CIN, ano-genital warts) in the target populations. It will investigate the response to vaccination depending on HIV related factors (plasma viral load/CD4 count/antiretroviral therapy status) and HPV related factors (current infection as determined by presence of HPV in the genital tract, or prior exposure as determined by HPV serology) on various trial outcomes (histological, cytological and virological). Finally, it will investigate the potential acceptability of such trial.

Specifically, the PHINDS proposal will inform the development of an HPV vaccine study among HIV+ women in SA by:
1) Estimating the potential impact and sample size required for a vaccination study among HIV+ women recruited within a cervical cancer screening programme based on HPV testing (HARP study). Statistical &amp;amp; modelling methodology will be employed, using HARP &amp;amp; another Johannesburg based study datasets.
2) Evaluating the true exposure of the study population to HPV vaccine types by combining results of HPV genotyping (already done) &amp;amp; type-specific HPV serology (to be done).
3) Evaluating the feasibility, acceptability &amp;amp; costs of HPV vaccination in the target population, service providers &amp;amp; other national stakeholders.
4) Setting up a research network to implement the study through the recently awarded NIH Clinical Trials Unit at University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Vaccines against HPV hold great promise for the long term prevention of cervical cancer &amp;amp; anogenital warts (AGW). Two vaccines targeting the most frequent genotypes involved in the aetiology of cervical cancer (HPV16/18) &amp;amp; AGW (HPV6/11), in bivalent &amp;amp; quadrivalent forms, have been licensed. A nonavalent vaccine covering 90% of cancer types is being evaluated. HPV vaccination programmes typically target young girls. However, the relevance of extending vaccination to other groups, e.g. HIV+ women, is of public health importance since they are at higher risk of HPV infection, persistence &amp;amp; disease progression. Cervical cancer screening programmes can identify HIV+ women in need of CIN management treatment &amp;amp; prevention through vaccination. Although HPV vaccines have been shown to be safe &amp;amp; immunogenic in HIV+ populations in South Africa (SA), data is lacking on their efficacy against CIN &amp;amp; AGW. Our hypothesis is that HPV vaccination can decrease the incidence of HPV-related disease among HIV+ African women. The goal is to determine the likely effectiveness of adding vaccination to an HPV-based screening programme among HIV+ women in SA to inform the design of a phase III/IV individually randomized trial of the effectiveness of vaccination against CIN2+ &amp;amp; AGW endpoints. We will test HPV serology in stored serum samples taken from SA study cohorts that have also measured cervical HPV DNA &amp;amp; CIN prevalence &amp;amp; incidence to examine current &amp;amp; prior exposure to vaccine preventable HPV genotypes. The data will contribute to estimate &amp;amp; model the fraction of vaccine preventable types &amp;amp; the expected vaccine effectiveness with a bi/quadri/nonavalent vaccine against CIN2+, AGW &amp;amp; persistent HPV, &amp;amp; determine key trial parameters (e.g. sample size, trial duration, frequency of visits, eligibility criteria). We will also extend the analysis to predict the effectiveness on cancers prevented among HIV+ women. Qualitative research will determine the feasibility &amp;amp; acceptability of the trial.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150026</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community Radio Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BCE4DB5D-0E74-4D97-BC30-7D8EF6681627</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wits RHI have organised 4 radio sessions with the Alexandra Community Radio station in Johannesburg to disseminate information about the high prevalence of CIN2+ disease in the population, encourage women to undergo pap smear testing and the importance of adhering to the follow-up appointments for further treatment.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CAB Feedback</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65AE2898-0568-4908-9F45-514FA062EB99</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wits RHI in Johannesburg have organised feedback to CAB (Community Advisory Board) on findings from HARP study (cervical cancer screening) and follow up PHINDS study (preparation for HPV vaccination)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>740</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>International HPV Conference 2015 travel award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>International Papillomavirus Society</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>0E16D052-E8C0-466F-ACEB-D4A644342191</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>900</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>AFRAVIH Conference 2016</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-04-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Francophone Alliance of Health Actors against HIV (AFRAVIH)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>B17085F7-17E6-490B-B4BB-4839C3ABEAFA</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>100000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>USD</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>Ecuador</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>es_EC</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CARTA PhD fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>51ECA167-2C4E-4154-9FFB-D56BB84D96B9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>250000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>South Africa, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>ZAR</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>South Africa</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_ZA</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CANSA grant</gtr:description><gtr:fundingOrg>Cancer Association of South Africa</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D9415ED9-92B1-4AFA-BB94-0B00A6B65052</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>National SA Cervical cancer screening policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2766503B-E618-42D5-AC4E-ECF5BF9B9893</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In South Africa, Wits RHI have been engaging with the National Department of Health (NDOH) for many years on the issue of cervical cancer screening and prevention (including through vaccination). 
During a DFID-funded research Consortium (2005-2010), we conducted a national level consultation with DOH and the Deputy Minister at the time in defining the research agenda that would be required to support the introduction and evaluation of HPV vaccination in the country. A number of research projects have been written which then led to the collection of data that have increased the awareness of policy makers and service providers to the need for improved cervical cancer screening in the country. 
Since then, senior researchers from Wits RHI have been providing direct inputs into Policy/Guidelines for screening of cervical cancer, which influence practitioners. 2016 guidelines are currently being revised utilising research outputs from the HARP Study (direct head to head comparison of cervical cancer screening methods among HIV+ women conducted between 2010-14). This will result in improvements of clinical service delivery, increases in detection rates and hopefully decreases in cervical-cancer morbidity and mortality.
Other findings from our research have highlighted the need, feasibility and acceptability to provide HPV vaccination to girls, as well as potentially other groups such as older women, HIV+ women, boys and men (HIM study 2009-2014). As a result, the NDOH has contracted Wits RHI to undertake an evaluation of the Pilot study of HPV vaccination of young girls in KwaZulu Natal (2014/15). The recommendations will serve to improve the vaccination campaign at national level with potentially huge benefits regarding decreased incidence of cervical cancer and thus economic and societal impacts. 
As part of the PHINDS study (2014/15), we have engaged with the Deputy Director of NDOH on the trial design fo an HPV vaccination study among HIV+ women in Johannesburg. The DD has provided support to the study, which has now been submitted for GHT funding (2016).
