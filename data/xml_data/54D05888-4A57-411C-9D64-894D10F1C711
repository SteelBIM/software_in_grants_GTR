The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has estimated that antimicrobial resistance costs the EU about 1.5 billion Euros in healthcare and losses productivity each year. The UK government has made clear actions into fighting antimicrobial resistance with a 5 year Antimicrobial Resistance Strategy Report published in September 2013. To tackle this important problem, this project aims to use synthetic biology as a key technology to discover and develop new antibiotics. The project will overcome the common problems associated with antibiotic discovery from natural sources, such as poor understanding of the antibiotic producer, poor growth characteristics, reproducibility, poor yield and a long time to market. Demuris has identified a promising broad-spectrum antibiotic but it is produced in low quantity. The University of Manchester will collaborate with Demuris, an SME expertise in natural products discovery, together with Croda, a large chemicals company with established routes to market, to fully unlocking the potential of this promising broad-spectrum antibiotic using synthetic biology approaches. Bioinformatics and biosynthetic gene cluster refactoring will be used for optimum expression and for introducing additional diversity of the chemical structure. The optimized biosynthetic machinery will then be introduced into Demuris's optimised production host for maximum yield required for commercialisation. In addition, the methods established in this work will be utilised for the activation of novel silent gene clusters identified from the genome sequence of the broad-spectrum antibiotic producer and the products identified and characterised for potential industrial applications.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>N/A</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150309</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Demuris Limited</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>TSB Demuris</gtr:description><gtr:id>F6ECBADA-4412-49EF-89F7-A918542824B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project is not yet finished and no outputs have been made.

The biosynthesis of such molecules is encoded by compact genomic units (biosynthetic gene clusters). Over the past decades, hundreds of biosynthetic gene clusters encoding the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites have been characterized. Although dozens of biosynthetic gene clusters are published and thousands are sequenced annually (with or without their surrounding genome sequence), very little effort has been put into structuring this information. Hence, it is currently very difficult to prioritize gene clusters for experimental characterization, to identify the fundamental architectural principles of biosynthetic gene clusters, to understand which ecological parameters drive their evolution, and to obtain an informative 'parts registry' of building blocks for the synthetic biology of secondary metabolite biosynthesis.
Therefore, developing a genomic standard for experimentally characterized biosynthetic gene clusters (e.g., Minimum Information about a BIosynthetic Gene cluster, MIBiG) would be of great value to the field of microbial secondary metabolism. Building on the MIxS standards for ecological and environmental contextualization, information on, e.g., enzyme function, substrate specificities, functional subclusters, regulatory and transport systems, operon structure, chemical moieties of the end compound and its intermediates, biosynthetic precursor compounds, compound bioactivity and molecular targets and compound toxicity could be added to allow cross-linking the information to biochemistry, pharmaceutical properties, genomic structure and ecology. Using the already developed computational pipeline for analysis of biosynthetic gene clusters antiSMASH (http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/), which has quickly become a standard in the field, information on characterized biosynthetic gene clusters will be linked to the untapped wealth of thousands of unknown gene clusters that have recently been unearthed by massive genome sequencing efforts. Taken together, this has the potential to guide the characterization of new metabolites by allowing to optimize the sampling of diversity at different levels and to identify the biochemical, genomic and ecological parameters that are key predictors of pharmaceutically relevant biological activities. Moreover, it can transform the unordered pile of literature on secondary metabolites into a structured and annotated catalogue of parts that can be used as building blocks to design new biochemical pathways with synthetic biology.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CD59A87F-E75C-41A3-BE45-ECDE98F4FB13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MIBiG will the better description and contextualization of sequence data, of important sequence elements, with concrete biotechnological applications that will increase the visibility and applicability of the GSC and its mission in the fields of applied microbiology, synthetic biology, natural products chemistry and enzymology.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>MIBiG</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://gensc.org/projects/mibig/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6F9D029A-7D6A-4F4D-8681-48E460161EDE"><gtr:id>6F9D029A-7D6A-4F4D-8681-48E460161EDE</gtr:id><gtr:title>SYNBIOCHEM-a SynBio foundry for the biosynthesis and sustainable production of fine and speciality chemicals.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Biochemical Society transactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/706f3fca80d0946ee33cf82e22864d70"><gtr:id>706f3fca80d0946ee33cf82e22864d70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carbonell P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0300-5127</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D76B624-0E7A-487D-A23D-2EA71E29D692"><gtr:id>7D76B624-0E7A-487D-A23D-2EA71E29D692</gtr:id><gtr:title>Natural Products</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be38063b5d41a616f3c54907ec097208"><gtr:id>be38063b5d41a616f3c54907ec097208</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Breitling R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781118298060</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/70E4FFFA-5EB3-4706-8C5B-4EF8B844FED7"><gtr:id>70E4FFFA-5EB3-4706-8C5B-4EF8B844FED7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bioinformatics for the synthetic biology of natural products: integrating across the Design-Build-Test cycle.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Natural product reports</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/706f3fca80d0946ee33cf82e22864d70"><gtr:id>706f3fca80d0946ee33cf82e22864d70</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Carbonell P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0265-0568</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0023F0B3-1103-4C4A-A742-FA778453C117"><gtr:id>0023F0B3-1103-4C4A-A742-FA778453C117</gtr:id><gtr:title>Synthetic biology advances for pharmaceutical production.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current opinion in biotechnology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/be38063b5d41a616f3c54907ec097208"><gtr:id>be38063b5d41a616f3c54907ec097208</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Breitling R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0958-1669</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M004910/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
