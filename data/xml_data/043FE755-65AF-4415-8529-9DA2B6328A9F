multidisciplinary centre for Digital Economy (DE) research and impact. We balance the development of new technologies to capture and analyse human data, with explorations of how these can be used to deliver powerful experiences to people, with an awareness and understanding of the human and social values that must underpin these. We follow a user-centred approach, undertaking research in the wild based on principles of open innovation. 

In its first phase, Horizon has established a core team of over 50 researchers and has reached out to build a wider network of 35 academic and 200 industry, public and third-sector partners. We have established a Centre for Doctoral Training and inaugurated the DE All Hands series of conferences and national DE CDT Summer School. World-class scientific outputs in diverse disciplines have been balanced with economic, cultural and societal impact.

This proposal builds on this critical mass to enable a step-change in Horizon's translational research and impact. We respond to the changing nature of the digital economy as it matures, as the social, physical and digital become blended and as human data becomes an increasingly valuable asset. We offer a vision in which human data enables the creation and delivery of highly personal experiences. We propose to address three major challenges. The first is to establish new technologies that collect and interpret our human data in a more transparent way. The second is to be able to better understand and design new kinds of experiences that employ these technologies to promote the values of personal fulfilment, wellbeing and sustainability. The third is to address key ethical challenges around design for privacy and new models of ownership.

We will work closely with a range of external partners whose interests span: computing and analytics; social policy; and diverse sectors of the DE including creative industries, retail, fast moving consumer goods, finance, energy, transportation and healthcare. We will engage these through a programme of agile translational research projects. These will be integrated into an overarching strategic impact campaign that revolves around three flagships. In turn, these will be supported by two further programmes; one targeted at sustaining the wider DE community and the second at developing the capacity of our researchers to deliver translational research and impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This primary focus of our proposal is on delivering impact across the maturing Digital Economy. We target business, third-sector organisations and public bodies from a diverse range of sectors including creative industries, retail, consumer goods, finance, energy, transportation and healthcare, as well as companies who are delivering the enabling technologies for interpreting and managing personal data and also the organisations that are shaping public policy around these.

These will benefit in multiple ways, including: 

- Understanding how to better interpret complex and ambiguous human data, including the potential of algorithmic, human and hybrid approaches;

- Understanding how to embed such interpretations into personally meaningfully experiences that meet wider objectives of fulfilment, wellbeing and sustainability;

- Knowing how to do this in an ethical way so as to maintain positive relationships with consumers, customers and citizens;

- Being able to envision and demonstrate future experiences that blend conventional media, services and physical products in new ways;

- Learning about the opportunities and challenges raised by such experiences through public deployments and field trials;

- Expanding the capabilities of the staff through exposure to new concepts, technologies and methods emerging from DE research;

- Gaining access to talented young people (especially CDT students) through internships and agile projects with the potential to recruit them downstream;

- Entering a neutral environment in which they can engage with other partners at different points along the value chain for future human-data experiences and from across the different sectors in which they are being applied.

Our proposal sets out a wide-ranging programme of impact activities to deliver these benefits, including agile translational projects, a strategically coordinated campaign to maximize impact among clusters of partners; and supporting programmes to develop individuals and the wide Digital Economy community.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4062954</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We created an interactive outdoor trail using content from the theatre's archive.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7C04659D-9F3D-4EDC-B49D-CD0FA37CA2E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The public could access and engage with archival documents which are not currently accessible to the public</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Hidden Tales of the Theatre Royal Nottingham</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://tickets.trch.co.uk/single/PSDetail.aspx?psn=122809</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Flamenco Dance</gtr:description><gtr:id>E65448EC-E678-46D0-A81E-E9284D3BDB1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dance performed at MAD15, a carnival organised at the Institute of Mental Health by Making Waves,</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Rumba</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.makingwaves.org/news/carnival-mad15/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A design intern (MP), from project partner RCA, produced a pack of ideation cards and two worksheets for use at a workshop called 'sowing the seeds of wellbeing', which was delivered to the public as part of the V&amp;amp;A's Digital Design Weekend 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0E076F52-7D78-4D13-840C-B959A6CB551C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These resources scaffolded a participatory design activity involving 151 participants, and allowed the project to collect data for research outputs.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Growing Data Ideation Cards and Worksheets</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news-learning-department/digital-design-weekend-2016</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>About Melvyn
Melvyn began his education studying A 'level Art and Design with Art History and Media Studies at Clarendon College (Nottingham), from 1983 to 1985. From there he enrolled upon a one year Foundation Course at Trent Polytechnic from to of 1986 and went on to gain a place ar St. Martin's School of Art in London that same year.
Unfortunately, due to illness, Melvyn had to quit his studies. In May, 1987 he was put on a six month section order under the Mental Health Act. There began a series of admissions into hospital and he was diagnosed with Schizo-affective
disorder.
Melvyn has stayed out of hospital for the past 20 years, and gained much insight into the ways of the mind; in illness and in health. For the past 15 years he has created artwork from his studio space on Carrington St in Nottingham and
continues to be influenced by the affairs of Mankind - his folly and his wisdom, the World at war and the World at peace.
About the artwork
&amp;quot;As an artist, I'm particularly interested in the affairs of Mankind; its religion, its politics, its World -as it is and, maybe, as it should be. I believe in one God, but many cultures, creeds, races and religions. I believe that God can transcend our differences, by focusing on our common humanity and needs as people -a world in union in a cosmopolitan pluralistic multi-faceted civilisation. There is a thread of interested in the theological that runs through my work, and a concern for the well-being of all people of the World through different cultures, belief systems, religions and the oneness expressed therein.</gtr:description><gtr:id>40D61DA6-0B9A-4C34-8D55-7C9ADC4BB052</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The launch of this exhibition was accompanied by a round table about religion and mental health.

Staring at the Sea by Mark Taylor
The work for this exhibition reflects my interest in the transcendental nature of the sea. Human culture and society are inexorably connected to the sea as the sea offers sustenance, hope and renewal. However, it also offers fear, uncertainty and incredible destructive power. Like many others I find myself drawn to the sea through what seems like a primal urge coupled with a fascination at the spectacle. The work I present here focuses on the calming influence of the sea and my personal connection with it. 

From a young age I have had to learn to cope with high levels of anxiety and bouts of clinical depression. This has to a large extent shaped my approach to personal work which often manifests itself as a form of therapy. In this instance, staring at the sea is something that becomes a meditative and contemplative experience. I enjoy the open space and the minimal aspect. The subtle interplay of light and colour between the Sea, sky and horizon offers an ever-changing aesthetic. The photographs in this exhibition are an attempt to reflect this. 
I take photographs here and there and then I spend hours patiently sieving through and find commonalities and connections, then classify them into to subject areas. This series is a combination of past work with additional new work made particularly for this show. There is a paradox of permanency and the ephemeral in windows/reflections . Eyes may be 'the window of the soul' but to me photographing windows/reflections is 'soothing of the soul' and more effective than medication for depression. 

Through a Glass Darkly by Tony Fisher
The work I am showing is concerning windows: reflections/mirroring what they physically look like, what can be seen through them or what we can be seen from them and how the elements interact with them. Some of the photographs show decay and deprivation, some express hope and a new beginning and others just show absurdity and a sense of fun.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FA4D148-4388-4BFE-A971-B64AB4277F3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The launch of the exhibition is attended by mental health service users, art students and mental health professionals and researchers creating a space to promote social inclusion and reduce social isolation among service users.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Dissimilar Reflections</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.institutemh.org.uk/x-about-us-x/art-at-the-institute</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I designed and developed The Runaway Hare - a hide and seek adventure performance for toddlers and their grown-ups that took place at Lakeside Arts Centre, Performance Studio Nottingham on 9 &amp;amp; 10 January 2017 The immersive, interactive performances were one hour long and was experienced by 65 people ( thirty children and 35 grown-ups).

Participants engaged and discussed about their online preferences and/or concerns regarding: algorithm bias, filtering systems, fairness and privacy issues.

At the end of the sessions, networking with teachers led to establish links with schools to promote other current research activities within our research team (e.g., UnBias Youth Juries). Also, this activity contributed to develop strong links with the organisers of the Science and Curiosity Festival, which takes place annually in Nottingham, and to express our interest to take part in future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://unbias.wp.horizon.ac.uk/event/explorers-fair-expo/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NUCLEUS Field Trip Follow-Up Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF1CE6C5-9E6E-4F1D-AF61-60FB4061F99F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The NUCLEUS project field trip visit to Nottingham in May stimulated an exciting discussion about the current and future state of Responsible Research and Innovation in the city and region and provided much food for thought. The field trip researchers were highly impressed by the knowledge, experience and commitment of the people they interviewed, while Nottingham proved to be the ideal environment in which to explore the relationship between RRI and public policy making. We're delighted with the feedback we have had from the NUCLEUS team and on behalf of the Stemcity partnership I would like to extend my grateful thanks to all of you who gave up your time to take part in the programme and also to those who worked so hard behind the scenes to make the interviews happen.

The field trip identified a number of common themes emerging from the interviews including:

 Nottingham has a very positive culture of partnership working between its research institutions and public policy makers
 However if RRI partnerships are to realise their potential dedicated management is needed
 Nottingham has an opportunity to be a 'living lab' in order to test bed new RRI approaches

Follow-up conference
In order to interrogate these findings in more detail a follow-up conference will take place on Friday 7th October from 9.30am - 1.30pm at the Council House. Through group workshops and plenary discussion we will explore:

 Strengthening local partnership working
 Developing test beds for new RRI approaches
 The impact of Brexit on UK RRI

Co-hosted by Nottingham City Council and Nottingham Trent University the conference is free to attend and a buffet lunch and refreshments will be provided.
Attendance is not limited to NUCLEUS field trip participants and we welcome registrations from other interested colleagues and partners. However places are limited to 40 so please confirm your attendance as soon as possible.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>7th International Research College of Theatre Arts for Children and Young People Syposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>146F2814-E18C-4C1C-BF86-F4AE7ED21679</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Postmodern Disintegration of Theatre Arts was held during International Children's Theatre Festival, in Subotica, Serbia.

They also promise new ways to pool and mobilise society's resources with the potential to address various impending social and environmental crises.

However, to reap these benefits, new thinking is required around the regulation and governance of smart online platforms to ensure balanced interests, and to promote fair and safe forms of participation, particularly relating to the role played by algorithms and data in driving economies of scale.

This policy event will provide a forum to address the following questions:

 What are the challenges and opportunities for public policy of Smart Online Platforms?
 How can we leverage platforms for a more equal, just, and knowledgeable society?
 How can platforms play a role in reducing the social divide and retain hard-won rights and protections?
 What are the challenges and opportunities for existing industries from their disruptive business models?
 How should the regulatory environment change and what new regulatory institutions or instruments may be needed?
 How can these technologies support public objectives and help policy makers deliver solutions at greater scale and of greater impact?
This event is being organised by the Smart Society EU FET project which has been exploring technologies and governance models for the next generation of Smart Platforms. The event will include the launch of the Smart Society Social Charter, and high-profile keynote talks.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://smartplatformcharter.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digitopia foyer experiences</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>76A10B15-05A5-4901-BCC4-4FCE17BA8E8D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Digitopia experience has been designed by Horizon and MRL to complement the stage show and offer a pre- and post-event for audience members.

At the end of the debate I posed the question, &amp;quot;is the emerging phenomenon of digital interaction a window into Jung's collective unconscious.&amp;quot; This could be refined into a debate/exploration of virtual social groups and crowd consensus or dissension on the internet and perhaps their effects on the physical world.

please email me if you for further thoughts.'

Evidence that the CaSMa blog is reaching policy makers is evident from two occasions:
On December 7th 2015, following a blog post regarding the House of Lords inquiry into online platforms we were contacted:
Dear Dr Koene,
 I just noticed your short blog on the Lords inquiry into online platforms, particularly commenting on the question relating to algorithms.
Would you care to respond to our inquiry, on that one question? You clearly have a lot of expertise in this area. A page or two would be sufficient and would certainly enrich the debate.
The only issue is that we will stop accepting submissions on the 10th of this month.
Nevertheless, given that you have already more or less written it
Best,
Kilian

On January 5th 2016, following blog posts on the draft Investigative Powers Bill we were contacted:
Dear Ansgar,
I work with the team leading on the Investigatory Powers Bill in the Home Office.
I hope you don't mind my approach, but we saw that you'd produced an analysis of the IP Bill on the CaSMa project blog site, and wondered if you might be interested in an informal discussion with officials working on the Bill. This could either be in London, or via phone if that were more convenient.
If you are interested in setting something up please do get in touch.
Best regards
Rebecca

The event was a sell out with 300 attending and created much interest on social media. 
The workshop considered the legal, social and technical dimensions of algorithms and their role in governance. As our everyday lives are more and more determined by decisions made by automated algorithmic processes, the status of algorithms and how they can be regulated , queried and countermanded, becomes evermore important. To give just a few examples, algorithms now often determine how we are assessed as risks for policing and terrorism surveillance: how we get hired, fired and promoted; and what news and political opinion we are exposed to. Both personal and societal welfare and arguably, the future of democracy itself, thus depend on being able to regulate and make accountable the algorithm society. In particular a major current question is if a right to explanation of what an algorithm has decided exists in data protection law? Lilian spoke on this in her contribution: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Slave to the Algorithm: War Stories and Legal Remedies&amp;quot;.
We hope the event will be a &amp;quot;starter seed&amp;quot; for CILP and partners (including Edinburgh and Horizon DEC, Nottingham) to investigate this fascinating topic further and we will be seeking major grant funding. ax 120000 characters)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.strath.ac.uk/humanities/lawschool/newsevents/algorithmworkshopfebruary2017/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>31CAD581-EE22-471C-A370-C27D8E31350C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EPSRC selected the Chariot project for a press release.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/chariot/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Yoga in children homes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9D35CFB-AA39-4F53-BCE9-331CDF39D099</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many yoga related sites cite this study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/news/pressreleases/2016/december/yoga-can-have-social-benefits-for-children-in-care-says-a-new-study.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participation in Nesta's European Research Alliance for Digital Economy &quot;Readie&quot; network event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69A20CC2-C64D-4BE5-A41B-8B2BBEF3AD68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking with policy and business leaders who are urgently trying to understand how digital technologies are changing Europe's economy.

The small felted objects/ props are designed with computational capacities. Tilt, magnetic, sound and accelerometers sensors stitch onto felt with conductive thread and connected to actuators or outputs to trigger sounds, lights or vibrations.

This will be with the requisite that they are members of the Personal Data &amp;amp; Trust Network.

This workshop is aimed at people working in SMEs, social enterprises, service and solutions providers, consumer-focused organisations, public bodies, research bodies and funding organisations who share the value of and want to help develop these interventions and interested in pledging to adopt consent receipts and the open consent framework.

Created in 2008 by several organisations, government representatives and experts, it fosters dialogue and collaboration with the Internet community on public policy for the Internet. Culminating in an annual conference that takes place in a different capital city, EuroDIG 'messages' are prepared and presented to the UN-led Internet Governance Forum.

EuroDIG is supported by a group of institutional partners, namely the Council of Europe, the European Commission, the European Regional At-Large Organization (EURALO), the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), the Internet Society (ISOC), the Federal Office of Communications of Switzerland (OFCOM) and the R&amp;eacute;- seaux IP Europ&amp;eacute;ens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC).

The main aim of EuroDIG is to promote the engagement of Europeans in multistakeholder dialogue in order to share their expertise and best practice and, where possible, identify common ground. This enables EuroDIG to pull together national perspectives and to apply and shape European values and views regarding the Internet.

Special attention was given to the ethics of personal data in both theory and practice and how social medial data (small data) can be accessed and analysed to:

- Understand the ways people use social media and what this means for individuals and society.
- Understand social phenomena and events expressed in social media by drawing upon social media as a critical, and timely, source of information.
- Develop facilities and approaches that are sensitive to the personal nature of human data: Citizen centric approaches.
- Promote responsible innovation in the capture, analysis and use of human data.

The ultimate goal of this workshop was to gather the knowledge needed to develop 'Facilities and tools for Citizen Social Science' and facilitate data access from an ethically sound approach.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conversation Article: Donate your data - how your digital footprint can be used for the public good</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E65981B-0B67-464B-B928-0CE01A66F58F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article in The Conversation: &amp;quot;Donate your data - how your digital footprint can be used for the public good&amp;quot;, 50k views.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://theconversation.com/donate-your-data-how-your-digital-footprint-can-be-used-for-the-public-good-35525</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public talk and launch of alpha version of e-Genie software at the Digital Catapult, London.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9372EDB-E9AB-4EA9-9361-D9C087AB4AA6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>20-30 people attended an open talk in the exhibition space at the Digital Catapult in London for the launch of our first trial of the e-Genie software.

In this workshop we will aim to share knowledge and best practice in order to inform our own and others' practices when working with social media data, with a focus on key areas including privacy, informed consent and risk. The proposed outcome of the workshop includes a new ethical framework with guidelines for best practice in social media research.

During the two-days workshop participants co-constructed a set of ethics guidelines for both researchers and ethics panel members in order to guide research protocols. It was very productive and by the end of the second day we had a set of guidelines and a series of case studies that illustrated the main ethical challenges to be taken into account.

The workshop was part of a project being carried out at the University of Aberdeen called &amp;quot;Social Media Privacy and Risk: Towards More Ethical Research Methodologies&amp;quot;, which is part a grant from the Economic and Social Research Council &amp;quot;Social Media - Developing Understanding, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Engagement (Social Media Enhancement)&amp;quot; (ES/M001628/1).

Unless people are given greater powers over their own data, fear of loss of privacy and freedom of agency will result in a loss of trust that will undermine the ability of the UN data revolution to achieve its goals of stimulating development through increased transparency.

The wording of the draft report by the Data Revolution Group includes more references, compared to the initial proposal, to the need to respect people's privacy and take consideration of ethical concerns with big data.

As one of the largest museums in the capital, this is a vibrant space to attract technology minded participants that are already motivated to engage in design. The theme in 2016 was the future of engineering and making. Members of the public visiting the museum could interact with installations and hands-on activities delivered by invited artists, designer, engineers and technologists. A free publication called Engineering the Future providing additional information about the work presented was also distributed at the event (and subsequently online). In total across Saturday and Sunday 24,487 people visited the festival.
 
Throughout the course of the two-day event, members of the project team - along with a couple of doctoral student volunteers gaining experience of public engagement activities - were based in the Museum where anyone could drop-in and participate. During the two days of the event 151 members of the public took part in our workshop 'sowing the seeds of wellbeing'.

Shortly after the Digital Design Weekend, the workshop was repeated locally, at project partner St. Ann's Allotments, where we deliberately set out to recruit participants with an established interest in growing plants, but not necessarily in design and technology innovation. This workshop was run with 5 participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/news-learning-department/digital-design-weekend-2016</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited Speaker- Trilateral Consulting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E7D0DCAE-6920-408B-BB47-13FFA47C6344</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following attendance at an event for the SATORI project, the organisers invited me to present about my research to the professional consulting company, Trilateral .</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Children's and Young People's Rights in the Digital Age: An IAMCR 2016 pre-conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C85883D-1D22-4000-8862-9D9948FE7E15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Are children's rights being newly infringed or enhanced in the digital age? Such questions concern researchers, child rights' advocates, and internet governance experts. Yet children's needs and experiences in the digital age are often neglected in high-level debates about global internet provision and governance and children's rights are treated as a minority interest and seen as demanding exceptional treatment from adult society. Further, current debates frequently emphasise the risks children potentially face online and underline their right to protection, but much less attention is gven to children's provision and participation rights online.

The conference will foster an international debate on key issues related to children's and young people's rights in the digital age, including: child and youth participation rights; online opportunities and risks; inequalities and digital exclusion; policy and multi-stakeholder governance; the role of peers and peer culture; participatory research; e-learning, health promotion and creativity in the digital environment; cross-generational dynamics of online engagement.
The conference includes a plenary presentation from Global Kids Online. It will begin at midday on 26 July and close at midday on 27 July to enable delegates to make the journey to Leicester for the opening of IAMCR 2016 (approximately one-hour train journey).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lse.ac.uk/media@lse/events/CYPR-IAMCR-2016.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited keynote to the Facilities Manager Forum event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>527FF140-E4CC-4F80-8F58-CA04A0F6DBC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited keynote at FM Forum event, prompted discussion on new approaches to reducing energy use in workplaces, and let to network building.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Web We Want Information market</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3D42F15-3606-42DF-BC6C-0BC49E975F11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CaSMa spent two days of the Web We Want festival manning an information booth at the Southbank Centre, speaking to the public about issues related to online privacy, data access rights and showed a slide presentation outlining our work.

Day 1 was focused on hearing from the projects and discussing findings and common conclusions. Day 2 was focused on presenting the findings to a wider audience.

On day 1, each project had 40 minutes to present their work with an emphasis on outcomes, findings and recommendations. In the afternoon there was a panel discussion to address the emergent topics and open discussion to the rest of the attendees.

On day two in the morning there was a session to summarise the project findings. This led into a discussion with the event participants on the findings and outcomes. After lunch there were breakout discussions on the key themes and report back from participants.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.itutility.ac.uk/the-impact-of-the-internet-of-things-on-the-food-supply-network/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Data Journeys Archway in the foyer of the Exchange building at the University of Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>851E11C6-D435-4699-9221-19FB125D7214</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Data Journeys Archway was being shown in the foyer of the Exchange building at the University of Nottingham from 14-22nd of February 2017.

The event was of particular interest to CaSMa for three reasons: 1. the panel discussion on on-line platforms, which we did some work on in relation to a call for evidence from the House of Lords; 2. understanding the social and ethical implications of the move towards a Digital Single Market; 3. discussions about the implications of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
The event also provided an excellent opportunity for networking at an EU level.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital4eu</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ethics for Business and Data Ethics</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74C48076-388E-4F7E-9987-54C081919E40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop participants included local SMEs. The feedback provided by participants showed that they 'found the information quite valuable', 'interesting' and 'a lot of information put into a short space of time. Well structured.'
Attendees requested more information about:
- &amp;quot;Data protection.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;How to keep client data/newsletter data safe outside of Mailchimp.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;I'd like to know more about future developments - new research that can help us all do better at using data ethically.&amp;quot;
- &amp;quot;Best practice - tools and examples of use and systems.&amp;quot;




Workshop participants found this activity useful, specially:
 &amp;quot;Helped put things into perspective. Very good and quite detailed presentation/hand outs.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The presentation and the opportunity to interact with others.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Discussion of the ethical use of data.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Addressing issues of email database safety - interesting to hear about Mailchimp.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The points about data ownership and the differences between ethics and morals.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;The real lack of legality to date - I didn't realise it was mainly a question of ethics and morals.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UnBias Youth Jury at the National Video Game Arcade</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2217EF92-86C9-4DA9-B53C-DBC4A8D72F41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>30 young people attended the youth jury at GameCity.

The event started with a series of talks from each Hub followed by a brainstorming session on key issues.
The talks included:
Tom Rodden, Nottingham introducing 'CaSMa: Citizen-centric approaches to Social Media Analysis' 
Pete Edwards, University of Aberdeen, on 'Social Media - Developing Understanding, Infrastructure &amp;amp; Engagement' 
Ranald Richardson, Newcastle, on 'Social Media Analytics for Social Geography' 

Claire O'Malley, Nottingham, facilitated the brainstorming sessions on key issues:
1. Social science issues in common/different/missing across the hubs 
2. Key challenges identified by each hub 
3. Technical infrastructure issues 
4. Stakeholder engagement 
Plenary report from lead for each session

This event concluded with a final discussion of next steps by Derek McAuley (Nottingham)

This was a great opportunity for Hub members to meet each other, build relationship and connect our work.


Topics discussed:
1. Key challenges identified by each hub 
2. Social science issues in common/different/missing across the hubs 
3. Technical infrastructure issues 
4. Stakeholder engagement 

Points raised in discussion:
Key Challenges:
Ethics: recognising that there is a problem.
- Responsible products
- Unintended consequences
- Companies and legal liabilities
- There is a need for a simple set of principles of personal data use for businesses, involving compliance-checking and possibly a kitemark to engender consumer trust.
Methodological issues:
- Different cultures
- Narratives
- Biases
- Epistemology
- Spotting big data issues
- Managing continual 'newness'
- Is human data different to human tissue?
- Issues of mistrust
Data Access and Ownership:
- Data is becoming increasingly valuable
- SM data is not always 'owned'
- What does ownership and licensing mean in this context?
Data Management and Training:
- Training/understanding of use of data?
- Personal nature of SM data
- Are services like UKDS on top of SM data issues? What is their role?
- Should there be a national point for training on these issues?
- Conveying ethical issues in SM data use to students and embedding in courses
- Translating to industry
Representativeness of the data being studied:
- Issues of sampling and selecting the behaviour to be observed discussed.
- Importance of statisticians in giving greater understanding of these issues.
- How does researching social media phenomena change what is being studied?
- Participants as subjects or co-authors?
- Issues of privacy, trust and understanding.

Social Sciences and Technical Issues:
- Sampling issues are key for approaches such as corpus linguistics (which assumes as systematic selection of texts).
- Issues around individuals using social media to 'perform identities' - personal brand management, particularly in platforms like twitter.
- Different demographics' use of different social media platforms.
- The importance of context in understanding, e.g., the impact of mobile vs static use of social media; the goals and set up of the social media platform and their impacts on posts, e.g., facebook vs. linkedin.
- Longevity of data: expectations that data is transient (e.g., snapchat) and right to be forgotten.
- Can we ever get truly informed consent and is withdrawal of consent possible?
- How does online identity affect offline behaviour?
- Qualitative and quantitative issues - geotags/timestamps.
- Relationships between social science theory and data: pluralism, multiple narratives, appropriate claims.
- Need to understand tools to develop progressive values.
- Effort is needed in collecting data - good sampling methods so not 'cherry-picking' data.
- Public views: shaping, cyberbullying, what is twitter etiquette?
- Start reframing technical infrastructure as 'sociotechnical infrastructure'.
- Issues of protection versus technical development.
- Issues of the intelligent customer.
- Vision of toolkit - SPSS++, R?

Stakeholder engagement:
Existing links and future possible partners were explored:
- Social rights groups, e.g., Liberty (existing links via Horizon)
- Census
- Local Authorities who are trying to use social media to broaden engagement - issues of exclusion and empowering the already-empowered.
- Broader public engagement
- Policy Makers (e.g., ICO)
- Question: what should our relationship be with SM platforms such as facebook/twitter/google?

Question: Is there a strategic RC mission around social media data that we can work to?

Wrap up and discussion of next steps (Derek McAuley, Nottingham)

? Possible joint future workshops:
- Engaging with stakeholders such as privacy international and/or local authorities
- Research data management plans for social media: recommendations for researchers/training for peer reviewers. Produce a guide?
- Given that ethical issues were common to all hubs, this seems like a likely topic for us to come together again on. 
? We will plan to schedule meetings 6-9 months in advance
? We will share information on events across the three hubs
? Branding: we will seek further guidance from ESRC on whether/how we might brand our activities as part of the social media research community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk &amp; Workshop, Finland</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19BA8AEF-07AF-41BE-A6DF-FAD59B5FF983</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was then invited to give a talk entitled 'Digital Embodied' - wearables in Theatre by the Finnish branch of OISTAT - (International Organisation of Scenographers, Theatre Architects, and Technicians) it is a non-governmental organisation founded 1968 in Prague, Czech Republic.

It is augmented with distance sensors, LED lights and projectors to sense people stepping through and to feed back on their interaction. It was a first experiment as part of the development of a larger archways project, an outcome of and follow-on from Andrew Wilson's shared research residency with Mixed Reality Lab and Sustrans (the national active travel charity) and Nottingham Research Fellow Holger Schn&amp;auml;delbach, funded by Horizon. 

When people approach the arch from either side, we project a question onto the ground in front of the arch, for example &amp;quot;Who has opened a door for you and where did it lead?&amp;quot;. People have a chance to think about that question even if they chose not to walk through the arch. If they then decide to walk through the arch, we use a sensor to record their height, which is displayed on the strips of LEDs on the side of the arch as they pass through. An observer discreetly using a web page on a mobile phone records some basic facts about the person, for example male or female, wearing a hat or glasses (when applicable), along with a choice from a range of positive statements about a personal quality, for example &amp;quot;Always smiling&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Steps forward boldly.&amp;quot; As the person passes through the arch, their height, their personal qualities, and a piece of &amp;quot;wisdom&amp;quot; in the form of a positive quote, such as &amp;quot;I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work. [Thomas Edison]&amp;quot;chosen at random from a list, are projected in front of them on the far side of the arch. 

The Data Journeys Archway is designed to make people reflect on their physical and personal journeys through live. It is also a vehicle to discuss with people how the built environment is complicit in the journey of personal data to become big data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DECA8796-D03C-45A6-AAB6-53B96DDCE0E2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data Journeys Archway was exhibited at:
