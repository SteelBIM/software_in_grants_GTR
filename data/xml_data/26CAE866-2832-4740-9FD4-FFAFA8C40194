Data</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L01016X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Music research, particularly in fields like systematic musicology, ethnomusicology, or music psychology, has developed as &amp;quot;data oriented empirical research&amp;quot;, which benefits from computing methods. In ethnomusicology particularly, there has been a recent growing interest in computational musicology and its application to audio data collections. Similarly, the empirical study of performance of Western music, such as timing, dynamics and timbre and their relation to musical structure has a long tradition. However, this music research has so far been limited to relatively small datasets, because of technological and legal limitations. 

On the other hand, researchers in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) have started to explore large datasets, particularly in commercial recommendation and playlisting systems (e.g. The Echo Nest, Spotify), but there are differences in the terminologies, methods, and goals between MIR and musicology as well as technological and legal barriers. The proposed Digital Music Lab will support music research by bridging the gap to MIR and enabling access to large music collections and powerful analysis and visualization tools. 

The Digital Music Lab project will develop research methods and software infrastructure for exploring and analysing large-scale music collections. A major output of the project will be a service infrastructure with two prototype installations. One installation will enable researchers, musicians and general users to explore, analyse and extract information from music recordings stored in the British Library (BL). Another installation will be hosted by the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London and provide facilities to analyse audio collections such as the I Like Music, CHARM and the Isopohnics datasets, creating a data collection of significant size (over 1m pieces). 

We will provide researchers with the tools to analyse music audio, scores and metadata. The combination of state-of-the-art music analysis on the audio and the symbolic level with intelligent collection-level analysis methods will allow for exploration and quantitative research on music that has not been not possible at this scale so far. 

The results of these analyses will be made available in the form of highly interactive visual interfaces. Musical questions we will explore include: how does performance style change change over time in relation to a particular genre or style, in classical, world, jazz, or popular music; how might performances of a given genre vary by geographical location; how does a performer's individual performance aesthetic develop over their lifetime; how might we identify the influence of one performer on another. Starting points for the analysis will be questions of musical timing and structure in piano music as well as in folk songs. We will also explore more generic musicological questions, such as the role of specific instruments in different cultures using data mining on the collection level, e.g. for relating similarities on the signal and metadata level. The resulting derived data that can be aggregated for research use, and the annotation of audio files with metadata, using all open standards such as the Music Ontology. 

The use of the proposed framework will be demonstrated in musicological research on classical music (building on the AHRC-funded CHARM and CMPCP research centres), as well as in folk, world and popular music. All results will be made available as open data/open source software. We feel that this project has the potential to bring together communities from musicology and MIR to mutual benefit.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this project include those directly involved, and those involved through our partner the British Library, and from any likely commercialisation of project outcomes. Those directly involved are:
(1) Users of the British Library, in particular of the Digital Music Collections
(2) The British Library, in particular the British Library Labs
(3) Existing and future users of Sonic Visualiser/Annotator (estimated as at least 10,000 currently) who will benefit from the extended capabilities that will be developed by this project.
Those indirectly involved are:
(4) Potential licensees and adopters of the music analysis tools showcased by this project
(5) Potential licensees and adopters of the big data analysis infrastructure and interfaces developed for this project
(6) Customers of licensees and adopters, specifically musicologists and the music listening public

These different constituents benefit in differing ways. Users of the BL will be able to access large data sources, to analyse large datasets, to download analysis results and to have access to interactive visualisations displaying analysis results. The BL will be able to improve their service and infrastructure, and will be able to exploit the large amounts of data, which already exist in the BL Sound Archive. Users of Sonic Visualiser/Annotator will benefit from tools that offer batch analysis of large corpora and provide interactive visualisations of analysis results. Potential licensees of music analysis tools, primarily industrial and public bodies in the music technology and digital libraries sectors, will be in a position to analyse efficiently and robustly large amounts of recordings, while their customers will enjoy a more informative and compelling experience of music appreciation. Finally, licensees of big data analysis technologies will benefit from an existing infrastructure, tested on one of the largest libraries worldwide, while the provided technology will be transferable to other types of data, for example books, images, videos, or metadata.

We expect beneficiaries (1) to (2) to gain significant benefit during the lifetime of this project, with this increasing as the main outcomes of the project are disseminated. We foresee benefit to beneficiaries (3) during and after the project. Finally, beneficiaries (4), (5) and (6) should see benefit after the end of the project. 

The project includes regular interaction between researchers, partners, and users, with particular emphasis on a training workshop for the developed tools, which will take place towards the end of the project. We will also develop documentation for the project, with the objective of making it available for use by the greater public, and we will create and manage a project website and repository. In order to inform and engage users, press activities will be organised, including presence in university Open Days, blogs and social media. Mechanisms to present this project to the public will be sought in conjunction with Press and Publications Office of City, Queen Mary, and UCL. We expect also to present the work at the London-based Music Tech Festival, which attracts potential beneficiaries from the creative industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>451750</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Computer Says Show' is a two part television program on the creation of the world's first computer-generated musical 'Beyond the Fence'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0E4B48D-FCD8-4ECF-B9B9-DE868152F85C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This program was broadcast on Sky Arts on the 25th Feb and 3rd March 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>TV programme: Computer Says Show</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wingspanproductions.co.uk/news-and-awards/read/48/Beyond-the-Fence-the-world-s-first-computer-generated-musical</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The musical Beyond the Fence was the first mainly computer generated musical, and the DML infrastructure with ASymMus similarity analysis was used to conduct research that supported the generation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D86F99E2-CC64-4024-9F36-D34663E37C52</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The musical Beyond the Fence was performed in the Arts Theatre in London's West End 22 Feb - 5 March 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Musical Composition and Production: Beyond the Fence</gtr:title><gtr:type>Composition/Score</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://beyondthefencemusical.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>The British Library</gtr:department><gtr:description>British Library</gtr:description><gtr:id>8BFDFEFA-19F5-4CD8-959B-1F23966A9C13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has extended through out the the DML and ASymMus project and is ongoing in the above mentioned projects.

Digifest is &amp;quot;a celebration of all things digital at UCL&amp;quot;, which for the UCL Music Systems Engineering Resarch Team (a.k.a MUSERT) , a.k.a Nicolas Gold, Samer Abdallah and Christodoulos Aspromalis) meant a chance to show off some of our recent activities as well as to call together the first meeting and performance of the UCL Laptop Orchestra, or UCLOrk.

At the showcase session on Friday 14th, we demonstrated various music-related applications, including Christodoulos's affective generative music system for computer games, the MiCLUES app (MiCLUES is a Share Academy/Arts Council England-funded project in collaboration with the Royal College of Music (RCM)) to guide museum visitors to the Museum of Instruments at the RCM., a device to help keep to the recommended 4 minute shower time limit, and a prototype of the DML information management system. The DML prototype allowed users to browse an RDF graph containing information about a local collection of audio files and symbolic scores, and then use this as a jumping off point for going out into the Semantic Web to pull in more information (via Linked Open Data and SPARQL endpoints), for example, from MusicBrainz (and LinkedBrainz) or DBpedia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ucldigifest.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>DML project at THATCamp British Library Labs</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7CB1C45F-BC03-4305-B47C-3411D1862E78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DML project members participated at the THATCamp British Library Labs, which took place on 13th February 2015 at the British Library.

This work was initiated and documented by Sky Arts and led to a documentation broadcast on Sky Arts and performances of the generated musical &amp;quot;Beyond the Fence&amp;quot; in the Arts Theatre in London's West End in Feb/Mar 2016. 

The content from the BL Sound Archive has been disseminated through our user interface and the workshops we held. We also provide access to the analyses of over 200k recordings from I Like Music (BBC primary content provider).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F9F5C5DC-DB5F-434D-BF55-14992DFBB091</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We developed the Digital Music Lab system that provides an interface for analysing large amounts of data. The system has analysed over 250,000 audio tracks from the British Library and from I Like Music Ltd, and has access to around 1m further tracks, which we are aiming to analyse. 

The technological challenges of data analysis were met by combining Big Data frameworks (Apache Spark) with existing audio analysis technology (VAMP plug-ins and Sonic Annotator). The findings regarding the computational aspects suggest that with modern BigData Hard- and Software, it is possible to support music research with large-scale analysis. To make the work interactive, it is necessary to employ smart methods for caching and background calculations. 


The interaction with existing systems, technologies, and standards, such as MusicBrainz IDs and Semantic Web technologies, specifically the Music Ontology, enables the integration with other data sources on the Semantic Web.

Interactive visual interfaces to support musicological research have been developed with musicologists and evaluated. We also gathered feedback from in two workshops at City University and the British Library, respectively, where music researchers with varying degrees of technological expertise were invited and geva valuable comments and feedback.

We made some progress towards the definition musicological methods for big data, but here significant work still remains to be done. This is for two reasons: some parts of music research need to change their methods fundamentally to address Big Data, and also the tools and interfaces are only beginning to develop, so that we expect interaction an mutual learning in the future research into Big Music Data research and technology.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results of this research project are available as open source software, and our software is designed for the extension to a networked system. We would hope for more libraries, archives and research institutions to start running their DML systems, so that a networked infrastructure for music research would be established. We are currently in contact with other institutions such as the Smithsonian institution (USA, DC) and Columbia University (USA, NY) to explore such collaborations. 

We are continuing work and hope to engage more collaborators to use our system to develop music research methods. To this end the server at the British Library is still available and we are disseminating the tools and approach among researchers in digital humanities. 

The developed infrastructure can also be useful for other researchers, e.g. in history of recorded speech, or other audio-related tasks, such as animal sound analysis or environmental sound analysis. The DML installation at the BL is actually being put to use by two research projects: Making Sense of Sounds (Prof M. Plumbley EP/N014111/1) and a Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship (Dr E Benetos, RF/128).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>239E34C7-6481-4FFE-A361-7D62A7DCBA17</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://dml.city.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Temperament data for audio analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>583CF4A6-5ACF-461C-AAD4-C89106AD24CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication in Early Music</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Temperament resources</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://dml.city.ac.uk/resources/temperament/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The features of the audio tracks analysed by the DML and ASymMus projects, including low, mid, and high-level features and similarity data, are available for download through our SPARQL endpoint.
