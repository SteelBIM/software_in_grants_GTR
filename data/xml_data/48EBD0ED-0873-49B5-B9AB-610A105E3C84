This information primarily comes from clinical trials which compared the interventions, and trials themselves need to be conducted in ways that are efficient and effective. In 2009, the MRC established the Hubs for Trials Methodology Research to conduct research to achieve this, and to facilitate the implementation of the findings of this research into practice in trials. A Network was created to add value to the work of the individual Hubs and this proposal seeks to renew the work of the Network for five more years and to extend the work to include a programme of training that will build capacity in methodology research for the future. This will be achieved by a unique programme of PhD studentships in trial methodology, which will create new experts in this area.

The Hubs provide a UK-wide, regionally distributed research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. The Network links the Hubs to enhance their individual activities, strengthen the methodological research further, and improve dissemination and education relating to good methods in clinical trials. The Network provides funds for high priority research to answer specific issues around trials; conducts workshops to develop methods and train people involved in trials; organises a large international conference every two years to bring researchers together to share their current research and learn from each other; and, will establish and implement a new programme for PhD students to train as methodologists within a national programme of methodology research.

The Network helps the Hubs to work with many people and organisations who are key to clinical trials in the UK and internationally. These include those who fund trials, such as the National Institute for Health Research and major charities including Cancer Research UK, Arthritis UK and the British Heart Foundation; those who organise trials, including the pharmaceutical industry and universities; the groups that support them, including the UK-registered Clinical Trials Units, Research Design Services and Contract Research Organisations in the private sector; as well as the users of health care and individuals who run trials in academia, practice and industry. 

Under this proposal, the Network will continue with its four main objectives and add a fifth relating to the PhD studentships. These objectives are:
a) Promoting high quality collaborative methodological research, both across Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally.
b) Providing methodological advice to the clinical trials community.
c) Encouraging the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing a coordinated package of education and training. 
d) Working with external stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance.
e) Capacity building of training in the UK by supporting a cohort of clinical and non-clinical PhD students in methodology.

The coordination of this studentship programme by the Network will:
&amp;gt; Create a cadre of scientists, including clinicians, with skills that will place them at the forefront of trials methodology development.
&amp;gt; Align the PhD studentships with the Network's strategic aims and research priorities, while reflecting the priorities of the Hub in which the student is based.
&amp;gt; Offer students unique inter-disciplinary and diverse analytical and technical skill training.
&amp;gt; Develop and sustain a vibrant postgraduate student culture in the Network.
&amp;gt; Raise the profile of the studentship programme, to attract outstanding candidates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Network has added value to the Hubs for Trials Methodology Research by coordinating activities, encouraging and facilitating high-priority research projects, and facilitating the implementation of good practice into clinical trials in the UK and internationally. The Network facilitates the conduct and implementation of research into the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials through cross-Hub work, as well as work between the Hubs and external teams. The Hubs and the Working Groups serve as key elements in delivering the strategy. The Network's objectives for the next period will be:
a) Promoting high quality collaborative methodological research, both across Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally
b) Providing methodological advice to the clinical trials community
c) Encouraging the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing a coordinated package of education and training 
d) Working with external stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance
e) Capacity building of training in the UK by supporting a cohort of clinical and non-clinical PhD students in methodology.
The work encompasses research into various aspects of clinical trial methods, including adaptive designs, statistical analysis, selection of outcomes and reporting of data. The Network resources are managed by the MRC CTU in London, with the Hub Directors as key drivers of the science, along with the convenors of six Working Groups, supported by the Network Co-ordinator. 

There are close links to the UK-registered Clinical Trials Units, charities and research funders, and policy makers. The Network will strengthen its relationships with industry and build on existing relationships with clinicians through, for example, the Royal Colleges and with patients and the public through, for example, INVOLVE and the James Lind Alliance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The Network will benefit the clinical trials community in the UK as a whole, including those working in academia, practice and industry. The research undertaken by the Network, the Hubs and the Working Groups addresses how clinical trials are conducted and provides a research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. This is also likely to benefit trials outside the UK.

How will they benefit from this research?
We will continue to ensure engagement between stakeholders and the Network, in particular through our Working Groups. This will ensure that high priority issues are tackled and that stakeholders benefit from the collective knowledge of the Network.

Our regular meetings with the Directors of the CTUs will continue and partnerships will be extended through the Working Groups and the conduct of Network funded projects in areas identified as high priority by the CTUs.

Our main impact outside of academia is likely to be through stronger engagement with the other major source of clinical trials in the UK, namely the pharmaceutical industry. We will continue to work with the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries, through engaging with the Experimental medicines expert network, and by attending appropriate meetings such as the R&amp;amp;D Conference in partnership with BIA and NOCRI. We will strengthen engagement with appropriate professional bodies (e.g. ensuring Network presence at meetings, including PSI conferences). We will provide opportunities for industry to present and participate in the Clinical Trials Methodology Conferences, ensuring their exposure to current methodological developments. We will work with Contract Research Organisations and software companies (such as Oracle Health Sciences Global Business Unit) who provide the infrastructure support for many industry trials. Further benefits will arise from the Network exploiting its capacity to act as a conduit between academia and industry, providing a link in the translational research pathway and ensuring that key issues are addressed via the Network Working Groups. 

We will continue our engagement with charities, including the main funders of clinical trials in the UK: MRC, Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research, Cancer Research UK, Arthritis Research UK (ARUK), British Heart Foundation. This will build on previous collaborations, including, for example, joint funding for workshops between ARUK and the Network. Trial funders will also benefit from Network advice on the appropriate information to collect when funding is being requested for new trials, and during trials (such as in the 'go/no go' decision after a feasibility study).
 
The Network will continue to engage with regulatory bodies and similar agencies, including the Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the European Medicines Agency. This will ensure that the Network remains a key source of knowledge and influence in the development of new regulations. 

The Network will strengthen its engagement with patient and public initiatives, including INVOLVE, which supports the involvement of the public in health and social care research. Individual Hubs have already worked with INVOLVE on issues relating to the involvement of patients in clinical trials. We will also work with the James Lind Alliance as it continues its efforts to identify shared priorities for research between patients and practitioners.
 
The Network will continue its work to promote good practice in clinical trials to a wide range of healthcare practitioners. This will include the provision of training in trials, publications and presentations aimed at practitioners rather than researchers, and further work to improve understanding and interpretation of the results of trials, including through systematic reviews.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2618711</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/L004933/2</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>F3822669-BB5A-4BB4-BAE0-DCB9DE36E092</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Generic Health Relevance</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>61645070-5FD7-4854-9441-A8EB3A8B21BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>7.4  Resources and infrastructure (disease management)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
