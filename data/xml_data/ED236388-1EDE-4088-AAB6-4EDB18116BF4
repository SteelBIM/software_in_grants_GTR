Information is transmitted to receiving cells via protoplasmic protrusions called nerve fibers or axons. Axons are remarkable, long cellular projections, which in different species can extend from a few micrometers, to ~1 meter in the human sciatic nerve, and presumably over 30 meters in blue whales. All animals face the same formidable task of maintaining the structural integrity of axonal projection throughout the entire life span of the organism. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying this process represents a challenging but fascinating scientific endeavor, with deep implications in the treatment of human neurological disorders. Indeed, axonal loss is one of the primary causes of disability in a rage of pathological conditions including traumatic injuries to brain (TBI) spinal cord (SCI) and peripheral nervous system, inflammatory neuropathies, inflammatory demyelinating conditions (such as multiple sclerosis), and certain neurodegenerative disorders. A notable feature of many human diseases is a pronounced alteration in the levels of numerous proteins. However, the upstream regulatory mechanisms controlling the aberrant production of these proteins remain unclear. For many years, it was thought that RNAs only function as structural scaffolds and messengers transferring genetic information from DNA to proteins. This view was drastically changed over a decade ago, following the seminal discovery of a class of regulatory RNAs called microRNAs. microRNAs are fascinating non-coding RNA molecules which are never translated into a polypeptide chain (protein), and are comprised of only 21 to 23 letters of the genetic alphabet. Strikingly, these tiny pieces of RNA appear to function as molecular rheostats of gene expression programs (protein production) in almost every living organism. Surprisingly, microRNAs have been shown to be dysregulated in many neurological disorders as well as traumatic axonal injuries. Still, it remains unclear whether microRNAs are central to the molecular mechanism controlling axonal structural integrity in intact and injury challenged neurons. Here, we propose to use the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) to shed light on the role of microRNAs in this process. The extensive conservation of molecular and cellular mechanisms governing nervous system development and function makes Drosophila an ideal experimental platform for attaining this goal. For these studies we will employ a multi-pronged strategy combining highly versatile transgenic technologies for microRNA loss and gain of function, state of the art transcriptional profiling, high-throughput microRNA target identification, and cutting-edge genome editing technologies for elucidating gene regulatory networks controlled by candidate microRNAs. While preventing clearance of severed axons in traumatic nerve injury appears to be detrimental for functional recovery, the knowledge acquired in this study may engender new targets for developing therapeutic strategies for other neuropathological conditions where axons are not severed but at risk of undergoing degeneration.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The architecture of the nervous system is dependent on sophisticated connections established by axons and dendrites. The ability of neurons to maintain the integrity of long axonal projections throughout the life span of an organism is a fascinating biological phenomenon. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms controlling this process under physiological conditions and pathological stress remains a fundamental scientific question. miRNAs are ~22 nucleotide non-coding RNAs that emerged as essential post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression programs in development and disease. Interestingly, miRNAs are abundantly expressed in the CNS, and have been implicated in modulating neurogenesis, axonogenesis, as well as synaptic morphogenesis and plasticity. Directly relevant to this proposal, both acute and prolonged alterations in the levels of several miRNAs following traumatic never injury have been reported, suggesting they may play important roles in neuronal injury response. We propose to explore the role of miRNAs in controlling axonal structural integrity and the response to traumatic nerve injury, using a multi-pronged and multi-disciplinary experimental strategy in the genetically tractable organism Drosophila melanogaster. Acute changes in miRNA homeostasis following traumatic nerve injury will be detected using state of the art miRNA profiling tools. High-throughput transgenic technologies will be used to discover miRNAs functionally required for axonal structural integrity and nerve injury response. Deciphering the regulatory pathways controlled by candidate miRNAs will be attained using cutting edge technologies for genome-wide miRNA target identification (Ago-HITS-CLIP). Finally, recently pioneered genome editing tools (TALEN/CRISPR) and epistasis experiments will be used to refine and validate direct effector genes. These studies promise to engender new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axonal structural integrity and pathophysiology.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The overarching goal of this research program is to understand the role of miRNAs in the molecular machinery regulating axonal structural integrity and nerve injury response. We anticipate that the outcome of the research proposed here may impact both basic academic and medical sciences.
 
Academic impact. The impact of this study on academic research is carefully detailed in the &amp;quot;Academic beneficiaries&amp;quot; section of this application. The information acquired over the course of this research project will engender new insights into the basic mechanisms maintaining the physiology and integrity of axonal projections during animal development and adult life. Furthermore, although focused on the nervous system, the interdisciplinary nature of this project and the technological platforms we propose to develop in Aims 3 and 4 will have broader consequences and will benefit microRNA research outside the neuroscience field. 

Medical impact.
The fundamental knowledge emerging from this study may also uncover potential therapeutic targets (or strategies) for situations whereby axons have not been completely transected but are at risk of undergoing degeneration. These include inflammatory neuropathies, inflammatory demyelinating conditions (such as multiple sclerosis), and certain neurodegenerative disorders. Because microRNAs are smaller, less antigenic and display a stereotypical mechanism of action compared to protein-coding genes, the field of microRNA-based therapeutics is rapidly gaining momentum. Both microRNA replacement therapies and systemic microRNA inhibition have been successful in animal models of human disease, and a therapeutic strategy for Hepatitis C (Miravirsen) has now reached Phase II clinical trials at Santaris Pharma A/S. We hope that our findings will eventually benefit patients and we will make every effort to disseminate our findings to lay audiences and healthcare professionals.

NC3R and policymakers in the UK and abroad. 
Because both microRNA identity and the molecular pathways governing nervous system development and function display a high degree of conservation from flies to humans, it is plausible that modifiers discovered in the fly model system, will have a similar impact in vertebrates. This will eliminate the need of exploratory screens in higher organisms and drastically reduce the time and effort required for these studies. A more targeted candidate approach will also reduce the number of protected animals used for studying pathological conditions where research is currently being pursued primarily in vertebrates, but Drosophila models already exist. These include traumatic brain injury, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and perhaps other conditions not directly related to the nervous system, such as wound healing and innate immune response. Therefore, in long term the studies proposed here could result in a significant reduction in the number of animals used for microRNA research in nervous system development and disease.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>482986</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tutorial on CRISPR genome engineering</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA749C46-F003-4FF5-9747-495230FB5CF9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Tudor Fulga held a tutorial on genome engineering for pupils at Magdalen College School Brackley Oxford.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wantage CE Primary school outreach activity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D16FDE2D-EB47-4567-8120-371669DA360D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>STEM organised event.

The screen was carried out in the wing nerve, a model system which has been successfully applied to injury-induced axonal degeneration studies. Axons in the anterior margin of the wing were labelled using a glutamatergic neurons driver (OK371-Gal4). Analysis of adult wings at two time points after eclosion (3 and 13 days) revealed six miRNA LOF conditions which displayed degenerative defects in axonal integrity. In a secondary screen, we confirmed the effects of these miRNAs at three time points. We also recovered 13 miRNA sponges, which appeared to display reduced or accelerated Wallerian degeneration. These included three candidate miRNAs that also displayed age-dependent loss of axonal structural integrity.

In subsequent experiments, we carried out an in depth characterisation aiming to decipher the role of these miRNAs in maintaining the axonal structural integrity during organismal ageing. Using a previously reported dataset, we sought to identify which miRNAs displayed age-dependent differential expression in the adult fly brain. Among all screen candidates, mir-284 showed a robust decrease in levels from 3 to 60 days. Analysis of adult wings from animals expressing the mir-284 sponge and mir-284 null mutants revealed severe axon fragmentation at 40 days but not at 7 days of age compared to wild type controls. Overall, 40-60% of wings showed detectable degenerative phenotypes at 40 days. Suggesting a generic function of miR-284, similar phenotypes were observed using an olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) model. Demonstrating the specificity of this effect, targeted expression of a rescue mir-284 construct in in OSN cells rescued the mutant defects. Furthermore, expression of mir-284 sponge in OSN neurons phenocopied the miR-284 null mutant defect. Axonal fragmentation following miR-284 LOF was reminiscent of injury-induced Wallerian degeneration (WD). To probe the involvement of the WD pathway in age-dependent axonal fragmentation, we expressed WldS, an axonal localized Nmnat1 fusion protein, in a mir-284 null mutant background. WldS expression fully rescued the miR-284 null mutant axon phenotype. 

Next, we set out to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying the role of miR-284 in axonal structural integrity during ageing. Similar to whole brain profiling, we found that the levels of mir-284 robustly decrease with age in antennal tissue. miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by binding of miRNA response elements (MREs) in target mRNAs and promoting translational silencing or transcript destabilization. Analysis of miR-284 putative targets using the miRanda prediction algorithm revealed the presence of a high confidence MRE and three additional clustered MREs in the open reading frame of wallenda (wnd) /dual-leucine kinase (dlk) mRNA. wnd encodes a MAPKKK that was shown to promote Wallerian degeneration in OSNs after injury and is presently one of two central genes casually linked to the WD programme. To establish whether wnd is regulated during ageing, we first measured wnd mRNA levels in antennae and found a decrease at 30 days followed by restoration of initial wnd levels later in organismal life. Interestingly, in mir-284 KO mutants, the level of wnd at 30 days appeared to be upregulated matching those observed in young 3 day flies, suggesting direct regulation of this target by miR-284 during ageing. Immunofluorescence analysis of adult brains at 3 and 30 days revealed a drastic time-dependent downregulation of Wnd in wild-type animals, which was virtually absent in mir-284 null mutants. De-repression of Wnd protein and mRNA levels in mir-284 KO at 30 days supports a putative mir-284-mediated control of wnd gene expression. 

Finally, we carried a complex and comprehensive genetic interaction study to demonstrate the role of miR-284 : wnd axis in axonal degeneration. To this end, we have first overexpressed wild-type Wnd in OSNs. Already at 5 days, these animals elicited severe degeneration of olfactory neuron axons. Second, we tested if there is a dominant epistatic relationship between homozygous mir-284 and heterozygous wnd3 null mutants or wnd knock down (RNAi). Heterozygous wnd mutants efficiently rescued axonal degeneration in the mir-284 nulls and this effect was partially recapitulated by wnd RNAi in the same context. We also found that both climbing ability and lifespan of mir-284 KO flies were severely compromised, and wnd3 heterozygotes partially rescued climbing performance in mir-284 mutants. This partial rescue by wnd3 heterozygotes raised the possibility that wnd is not the only mir-284 target responsible for the observed degenerative phenotypes. To shed light on the mir-284-regulated transcriptome, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on wild-type and mir-284 KO antennae at 3 and 25 days of age. Strikingly, the mir-284 mutation reduced age-dependent variations in gene expression compared to normal flies. When normalized to age-related transcript levels in wild-type animals, miR-284 mutants manifested lower fold change with age for most mRNAs.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have identified the first miRNA involved in maintaining axonal structural integrity during organismal ageing. Furthermore, we showed that miR-284 controls this process by post-transcriptionally regulating the levels of WD-associated protein wallenda. This work is now in preparation for publication. Further studies could now be carried out to determine the role of this miRNA (or others) in age-dependent axonal degeneration in vertebrates.

In a parallel line of investigation we have developed a novel method for unbiased characterization of microRNA response elements (MREs) by direct monitoring of miRNA-binding events in intact organisms. The conceptual framework of this technology called miR-TRACEseq is based on in vivo crosslinking followed by RNase H cleavage of putative MREs. The binding of miRISC at individual target MREs is analysed in situ, without any external intervention. We have demonstrated the efficacy of this technology on a previously validated primary network of miR-184 targets. These experiments showed that TRACEseq enables parallel analysis of multiple MREs or an entire target network in situ. Consequently, any accessible tissue or cell line could be readily assessed by miR-TRACEseq. The performance of this technology and its simple implementation suggests that it could be used as a complementary method to Ago-CLIP, by comparing wild-type and miRNA mutant conditions. In the immediate future we plan to apply miR-TRACEseq for in vivo screening of miRNA::target interactions in the context of age-dependent axonal stability and injury-induced Wallerian degeneration.

Finally, we have developed a novel binary expression system based on transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) and variable activating sequences (VAS), which can be programmed to drive tissue-specific expression of diverse transgenes in vivo. We demonstrate that individual TALE-VAS pairs can be easily multiplexed, enabling parallel transgene delivery to distinct neighbouring cell types of the Drosophila nervous system. Since the number of combinatorial TALE-VAS pairs is virtually unlimited, this platform paves the way for highly complex genetic manipulation studies in vivo. We anticipate this technology will be of great interest to the broad scientific community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F50A0875-AEFB-4BDD-9E4D-136F5EE68E2B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have established the adult Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons as a useful model for age-related axon degeneration.
