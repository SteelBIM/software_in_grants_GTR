Shropshire</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K000233/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project will bring to completion a long-term study of Shropshire place-names begun by Dr Margaret Gelling, former President of the English Place-Name Society (EPNS) and one of the subject's leading exponents of the last forty years. Before her death in April 2009, Gelling had published around half the county in five volumes, with a sixth almost complete and now in press. In four further volumes we aim to cover the remainder of the county and to provide a full introduction to the completed survey.

In the process we shall assemble and discuss the evidence for thousands of names of settlements, natural features and landholdings. These names were coined from the early medieval period onwards by those who owned, governed, lived on or worked on the land, and they stand as evidence for the concerns and perceptions of these people, for the languages that they spoke and for a landscape sometimes quite recognisable, sometimes wholly altered. 

Place-names can offer a unique insight into aspects of the past which -- because they are so local, so commonplace, or reflect developments at such an early date -- are not recorded in other kinds of documentation. They illuminate well the essentially local and particular, in indicating the former presence of the long-extinct lynx at Lostford, for example, or in identifying the sites of now-drained pools or levelled tumuli. However, place-name evidence can also be used in addressing weightier aspects of social or linguistic history, and in our final introductory volume we shall address a wide range of research questions relating to the linguistic, social and political history of this large division of the western midlands of England. There are questions here about the origins and boundaries of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Mercia, about the creation of shires and hundreds, about the variety of agricultural practice across the county (and particularly the extent of the spread of 'open-field' farming), and about the regional development of the English language.

Particular questions surround the relationship in this area between Welsh and English languages. We shall devote a special study to the extensive evidence for the Welsh language in Shropshire, seeking to place it within a context of what is known of the linguistic border from north to south throughout the middle ages and modern periods. Other large research questions are then directly related to this one: how far, for instance, does the full evidence support Gelling's suggestion that many of the English place-names of western Shropshire may have been coined by Mercian administrators, over the heads of a largely Welsh-speaking population?

Gelling's work was based on a substantial collection of historic place-name forms largely assembled over many years by local Shropshire volunteers. This collection has now passed to the Institute for Name-Studies in Nottingham where we can draw on established resources and experience to carry out the necessary tasks of organising, analysing and interpreting the material. For the Welsh element of the work we are able to draw on the resources of the University of Wales Centre for Advanced Welsh and Celtic Studies in Aberystwyth.

The research will be made widely available to the scholarly community, and others, in the form of four EPNS volumes, taking their place in a series which is an established and familiar resource to a wide range of scholars from many disciplines across medieval and modern periods, including political, social, and economic historians, linguists, archaeologists and historical geographers. The research will not only be cited by many scholars, but also developed, and used as a basis for further research. In addition, the interest of the subject, and its relevance to so many historical topics, will be conveyed to the Shropshire community by means of an exhibition and a series of talks in the county.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Beneficiaries of our research: who and how

Our research into England's place-names is demonstrably of interest to people outside academia:

a) The amateur onomasts, historians, archaeologists, and local enthusiasts who make use of the EPNS survey volumes, and the Institute's web-resources (particularly the AHRC-funded Key to English Place-Names, newly launched with a Google Maps interface in January 2012) and outreach talks, for their own research, interest, and pleasure. Members of the Institute have been invited to give over a hundred talks to local historical and archaeological societies throughout England since 2000, reporting findings, activities, and resources. These talks often generate subsequent queries and indeed collections of material from audience members; Institute staff are happy to provide answers and advice. In turn, the material is usually incorporated into our archives. Thus it is a two-way process of benefit to all parties.

b) The wider public, who enjoy finding out about their local nomenclature. This interest is clearly evidenced by requests from the local and national media for interviews, contributions, and outreach material (the Impact Plan includes further details of our past record in this area). 

This interest can be harnessed to benefit

c) library and information service providers (see below), through increased footfall and an increased public awareness of the local interest resources on offer (books, databases and other IT resources, talks, and courses), and an increase in staff expertise in the areas of onomastic and linguistic research. 

2. Increasing the likelihood of impact 

to audience (a). Dr Baker will offer two talks to the Shropshire Archaeological and Historical Society, outlining not only the project's findings and points of special interest, but also the new resources available. Talks delivered outside Shropshire, while perhaps not directly addressing the research, will publicise it. The Institute hosts the Cameron lecture, which attracts a capacity mixed audience of academics and non-academics (Margaret Gelling herself delivered the inaugural lecture); details on the Shropshire research and resources growing out of the Shropshire research will also be publicised there. 

to audience (b). In order to maximise impact we envisage activities which will attract (i) those who are already aware that they might find place-names and local history fascinating, and (ii) those who are not:

(i) We propose to mount a travelling exhibition on Shropshire's place-names, including photographs and relevant documents (originals and copies), with commentary and booklet. The exhibition will spend six months each in Oswestry Library, Ludlow Library, and Shropshire Archives (Shrewsbury), thus achieving good county coverage. It will be opened in each place with a fully illustrated public lecture, with Parsons and Watt speaking in Oswestry, Cavill and Baker speaking in Ludlow, and Carroll and Baker speaking in Shrewsbury. We have the enthusiastic support of Mary McKenzie, the County Archivist, and James Anthony-Edwards, Head of Libraries and Information within Shropshire. During our visits, we will also provide guidance on place-name resources to audience c, the library and archive staff.

(ii) We have proposed to Vanessa Hodgson, the features supervisor of the Shropshire Star, a series of short features on particularly interesting examples of local place-names. The Star, an evening paper, has six editions daily, is published six days a week, and has an average issue readership of 223,000 adults. The articles will be timed to coincide with the exhibitions, and should increase the number of visitors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>714719</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oswestry Town Museum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exhibition, Oswestry Town Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>947802FB-840F-4BC1-B552-1147EEC99C68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition, Oswestry Town Museum, November 16 2015 to 12 January 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The director of Oswestry Town Museum provided curatorial support for an exhibition</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We curated an exhibition at the museum.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oswestry Library</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exhibition, Oswestry Library</gtr:description><gtr:id>02C4C1EA-E90F-40AB-B5CD-24AA635F4871</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition, Oswestry Library, 12 October 2015 to 13 November 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Staff at Oswestry Library provided curatorial and practical support for the exhibition, and advice on marketing etc.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We curated an exhibition, freely available to the public, at Oswestry Library.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Museum Resources Centre Ludlow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exhibition, Museum Resources Centre, Ludlow</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FFD3416-7E68-4461-9BA6-09A1B67AD2F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition, Museum Resource Centre, Ludlow, 15 Feburary 2016 to 31 March 2012</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The holdings of the MRC were made freely available to us, and formed part of the exhibition.

Ludlow was the second Shropshire town to host this exhibition (following on from Oswestry in 2015). The purpose was to publicise the research being carried out and increase awareness among residents of Shrosphire of the rich history of their county's place-names. The exhibition and project were featured in an article on 29 December 2015 in The Shropshire Star. In addition, Carroll was interviewed about the exhibition on 12 February 2016 during BBC Radio Shropshire's Jim Hawkins morning programme.Feedback was received on Day 1 of the exhibition from Shropshire's Finds Liaison Officer, Peter Reavill: 'Feedback locally is that people love the exhibition - and it does look lovely' (email dated 15/2/2016). Later, 29 completed evaluation forms were received regarding the exhibition: 93% strongly agreed or agreed that the talk was interestiing; 89% strongly agreed or agreed that they had learned something new; 73% were inspired to find out more about place-names; 86% strongly agreed or agreed that they had gained new insight into their local environment; and 79% said they would attend another event about place-names. Individual comments included the following:
&amp;quot;Absolutely fascinating. Makes you look at your environment differently.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;A very clear explanation of the various exhibits, encourages one to follow up the subject.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;An excellent exhibition. Very well put together. Most enjoyable and very informative.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;I found this exhibition fascinating. I have often used Old English placenames in my paintings as they are extremely poetic and evocative and frequently their history is overlooked. I was particularly interested to learn about George Foxall's field-name maps. I have a copy of one of my village but did not know anything about the man who had made it.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Beautifully mounted - thank you. An awful lot of detail (to stand and read at 81!) but one can't really complain about scholarship. We're lucky in this benighted age to still have such exhibitions to go to!&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Excellent exhibition with a good range of sources shown.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Very informative and clear displays. Lots of room to view properly. I was most interested in the Welsh place-names in western Shropshire.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Beautifully laid out exhibition!&amp;quot;

A public lecture took place (given by Carroll and Baker) on 16 March 2016 to accompany the exhibition, with the content tailored to interest an audience local to Ludlow/South Shropshire (see separate entry).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Ludlow Library &amp; Museum Resource Centre (LLMRC), Shropshire, 16.03.16 - Baker, Carroll.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2B09C369-1DBA-4E60-91E7-0614CD62E32A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk entitled 'South Shropshire place-names: language, landscape, history' was deivered by Baker and Carroll.

&amp;quot;Very well presented. Alternating speakers kept our interest. V. good slides.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;The presentation was interesting and the alternation of the speakers gave a good change of voice. The only criticism I would have is that I would have liked more detail about southern names in the South Shropshire area but that is being parochial!

'A highly enjoyable experience'; 
'Really interesting exhibition - really enjoyed the history of local street-names and towns'; and
'I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the local areas and field maps'.

The exhibition was planned to end on 18 December 2015, but the display material was kept in place by the hosts until 12 January 2016. All those who completed evaluation forms requested information on future similar events in the county on the theme of place-names. The Director of Oswestry Town Museum, Mr Mark Hignett, wrote to the project team on 15 January 2016 as follows:

&amp;quot;It was great to get a chance to talk to someone who has studied the area - and names thereof - where I live &amp;amp; investigate &amp;amp; explore. Also good to hear the sources used and the progress of place-name study currently. This helps us to understand from another perspective the history &amp;amp; settlement of the land around my area in Shropshire.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Fascinating - it transformed the map &amp;amp; stimulated the imagination, as well as teaching a lot about how the knowledge is being arrived at.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Really opened my eyes as to what a specialised study place names research is! Am very impressed by how painstaking and meticulous all researchers have to be.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Could happily have attended a whole day session &amp;amp; in more depth.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;As a Welsh resident, I found the Welsh placename elements most interesting.&amp;quot; 
&amp;quot;Splendid exhibition &amp;amp; I picked up a lot of useful bits of information. I was glad to see the famous typewriter &amp;amp; learn more about George Foxall's methods.

&amp;quot;I found this exhibition fascinating. I studied Old English as part of my degree and, in retirement, am learning Welsh.

&amp;quot;A fascinating exhibition - so much information and wonderful illustrations appropriately chosen. Wish I had heard about it sooner - would have passed the info to others.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Extremely interesting. I have always found G Foxall's maps based on the Tithe Apportionments absolutely fascinating and extremely useful for local history research projects.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;I have always been interested in place-names and have many books on the subject...A lot to take in on one visit, especially standing up! Will there be a book or a permanent website? Would be good if there is.&amp;quot;

We have generated associated scholarship on particular name-types (e.g. s&amp;aelig;te-names, river-names, and the personal names preserved within place-names), and on the linguistic history of the Anglo-Welsh border area (vocabulary, linguistic interplay between English and Welsh), and on aspects of history of the area that the study of place-names can illuminate.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The material we are producing will be of enormous interest to archaeologists, historians, geographers, and historical linguists, who can use our dataset as primary material in the interrogation of their own research questions.
