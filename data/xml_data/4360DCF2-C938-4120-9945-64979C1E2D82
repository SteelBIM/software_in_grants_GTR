Using the past to guide the future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L002825/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Our project will examine a crucial question for ageing societies: how inequalities across the life course relate to paid work in later life in the UK. This issue is of growing importance since the UK, in common with many other governments across the world, is rapidly extending the working lives of older adults through the postponement of State Pension Age (SPA) and other measures. These policy reforms affect millions of people, yet their implications for health and wellbeing are unknown. Do these policies harm, benefit or have little effect on the population? To answer this, we need to understand the lifelong drivers affecting the complex relationship between paid work in later life, health and wellbeing. 

Our project extends an existing UK-Canadian collaboration that is examining lifecourse influences on later life work trajectories and their implications for health and wellbeing across five countries (including the UK). We will build on this work to address the implications for health and wellbeing of undertaking paid work up to and beyond SPA in the UK. This is important because comprehending what distinguishes those who work beyond SPA from those who retire at or before SPA is key to understanding the extent to which there is scope to extend SPA without exacerbating social inequalities. 

In industrial societies, near universal retirement from paid labour linked to the provision of state pensions has been heralded as a significant advance in older people's wellbeing. It is increasingly clear, however, that as longevity increases social welfare systems face significant fiscal challenges. In response, many countries, including the UK, have implemented retirement reforms such as abolishing mandatory retirement and raising state pension ages. These changes have fostered tension between the desire by individuals for a funded retirement at the normative age (e.g. 60 or 65) and the perceived economic need for populations to work longer in the context of societal ageing. 

Moreover, there is increasing concern that these policies may have disparate effects on different segments of society. However, most prior research in this area has focused on the effect of early retirement on health. We already know something of the characteristics of those who retire early and those who work beyond SPA. For instance, in Britain, ill-health and disability are the most important reasons for early retirement. Those who work beyond SPA are more likely to be better educated, in good health and have a partner in paid work but they are also more likely to be self-employed, to work part-time and, among women, to be in low skill jobs. However, to our best knowledge, nobody has addressed the consequences for health and wellbeing of working up to or beyond SPA. We also know little about the life course trajectories that influence who works up to or beyond SPA; or how they shape the relationships between later life work and health or economic resources. There is also little understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms that might link paid work and physical and psychological health outcomes. Last, by defining how the relationship between SPA and health has changed over time, and across cohorts, we will be better placed to inform debate on the potential impact of future policy decisions. Understanding these issues is critical to the development of policy that minimizes how inequalities may be perpetuated through the lifecourse.

Our interdisciplinary team will tackle these issues in projects that cover three major areas: i) a comprehensive assessment of the lifecourse determinants and consequences for health and wellbeing of working up to and beyond SPA; ii) an evaluation of whether (and how) these relationships have changed for different cohorts and over time; and iii) modelling of the financial consequences of working up to and beyond SPA for those with different lifecourse trajectories.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Given the scarce evidence base regarding the implications of working until or beyond State Pension Age (SPA) for health and wellbeing this study will be both of national and international importance and will benefit a wide range of people. In addition to the academic community our project findings will be of interest to a wide variety of NGOs, including think tanks, older people's and human rights organisations and charities engaged in policy work. For example, the research findings will be of direct interest to groups lobbying government on behalf of pension, workplace and health reforms. Moreover, our research will be of use to groups lobbying government for improvements to older people's lives such as Age UK, and those interested in equality issues such as the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Fawcett Society.

Our findings will also be of interest to those working on older people's issues in government departments, local authorities, and independent policy bodies. For example, the Department of Health is likely to benefit from a much improved empirical knowledge base of the life course in considering social policy interventions in later life health outcomes. The Department of Work and Pensions is likely to benefit considering their interest in ageing well and in the extension of working lives.

The Institute of Gerontology (IoG) has a longstanding connection with the Pensions Policy Institute which has agreed to help disseminate the project results to key policy makers and to older people themselves. In addition, our project partners have agreed to act as scientific steering committee and dissemination strategy group members advising on scientific input and the dissemination strategy related to the policy implications arising from our work. Dissemination will take place formally and informally through these wide networks of policy actors. Formal dissemination activities will consist of yearly seminars (contributing to the Department's internal and public event seminar series), a project web page to be hosted by King's, a report of the research findings and an end of project seminar to distribute and publicise the findings to a wide audience of those involved in government, NGOs, EU and UK policy makers, other voluntary organizations and think tanks.

This research will importantly provide knowledge for older people, employee organisations including trade unions, employers and human resource professionals about the health and wellbeing implications of working until or beyond SPA. Thus, it will enable older people to make choices either directly or indirectly through professionals and employers who may advise them.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1057333</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Scottish Public Pensions Agency</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pensions Policy Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C604C42-D918-4CD7-A350-D8A94287B9B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To date the collaboration has led to two briefing notes, PPI Briefing Note Number 84 and PPI Briefing note Number 92; details for both are in publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>PPI has led one of the consortium workpackages on modelling incomes in retirement which is based on a large number of runs from the PPI's Individual Model.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The PPI is a project partner and work package leader for this ESRC funded consortium.

WHERL researchers presented four papers of early findings to a officials across government with a policy interest in the findings with ample time for questions after each paper and then a broad discussion with all researchers. As well as noting the emerging and cutting edge evidence which was of great interest to various Departments, discussions ensued about the best format for various types of dialogue between the researchers and government, evidence gaps and future directions of research.
Presentations: 
Karen Glaser. Cross-research council funded consortium on Wellbeing, Health, Retirement &amp;amp; the Lifecourse.
Giorgio Di Gessa. Are there health benefits to working beyond state pension age?
Rebecca Benson. Health and work in workers beyond state pension age.
Gayan Perrera. Paid employment and common mental disorders in 50 - 64 year olds: analysis of 14 years of national data.

Several outcomes have emerged from this meeting especially specific requests by government for information from the project, for example as follows:

&amp;quot;Some interesting points came out during the DWP presentation e.g. the effect on widowhood on the likelihood to work in later life, and some discussions about how this and other findings (e.g. the effect of being paying a mortgage) could suggest the role that social norms, &amp;quot;subjective standard of living requirements&amp;quot; or financial constraints in determining labour supply in later life (keeping things like health and age equal). Could we put together this and come correlates of not continuing in work at older ages to paint a descriptive picture of what's going on with older women? In this sense, are the time series long enough to allow insights on slightly younger women, before State Pension Age? (many of them drop out in their 50s!).
 
The &amp;quot;trajectories&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;profiles&amp;quot; Laurie is building will be a great base for the PPI modelling - but DWP would find data on these profiles/trajectories interesting in their own right. E.g. can you in any way know what rough proportions of the population might fall into each of these profiles? (Painting the descriptive picture delineating the population subgroups is often a starting point for policy thinking). And anything we could understand about part-time work for women is also extremely interesting.&amp;quot;

The symposium was assigned a large auditorium and attracted substantial attendance. After the symposium some of the leading British Gerotnologists (e.g. Sara Arber) commented on the outstanding talent emerging in gerontology among early career researchers in lifecourse studies. Consensus was that this was an extremely interesting symposium with food for thought and presenting important findings.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting at the European Commission, 12th January 2015: Introduction of the WHERL project to staff at the European Commission's Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.

They were especially interested in the findings about flux between &amp;quot;reitrement&amp;quot; and in returns to work thereafter as well as in understanding how datasets such as SHARE can be used for responding to these questions of considerable policy importance. Attendees expressed interest in receiving and reading any briefing notes we generate. von Nodeheim talked about how to create a functioning labour market for the over-55s, which was his main areas of interest. They currently work with the OECD on micro-simulation of pensions with ideal type individuals and Ralf was interested in how the work with the Pensions Policy Institute might help to refine those models for wider segments of the population and how this method might be transferable to other country contexts, such as with SHARE data.
We therefore increased understanding about each other's activities, and maintained this cordial relationship with important European policy makers.

Excellent dialogue between academic and stakeholder partners and policy makers from the European Commission. They are greatly interested in the production of robust data on extending working life, ageing and health. They are looking forward to receiving future output from the project. We were able to share with them the work that the Pensions Policy Institute is doing, which might be interesting for future work at the European Commission.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://wherl.ac.uk/news/loretta-platts-introduces-the-wherl-project-to-the-european-commission/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Glaser, Corna, Platts, Worts, Price &amp; McDonough 'WHERL:  three year study of ageing, work &amp; health', Invited Presentation to the International Centre for Lifecourse Studies Project Networking Meeting, London; 24 February 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6BBCBD96-1101-47A3-AA53-C577457D64B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Corna, Platts, Worts, Price &amp;amp; McDonough 'WHERL: three year study of ageing, work &amp;amp; health', Invited Presentation to the International Centre for Lifecourse Studies Project Networking Meeting, London; 24 February 2015

This report will also be presented at an end of award event to be held on the 20th of June. The sequenced life histories have enabled us to classify the population according to their individual approximation to sets of complex employment histories which until this research have eluded estimation, and to further examine those according to other complex life history sequences of marital status and fertility. As well as knowing what lifecourse patterns the currently older population exhibit empirically, which is itself of interest, this has enabled a rich understanding of how the lifecourse influences later life outcomes. Results as would be expected suggest considerable heterogeneity in the employment histories of women (7 patterns emerge) with just two groups sufficing to describe 96% of men in these age groups (i.e. full-time throughout and full-time early exit). Consequent work looking at multiple health outcomes (latent physical health, depressive symptoms, sleep disturbance) has controversially shown that once socio-economic characteristics as well as adulthood and baseline health are accounted for, the association between better health and undertaking paid work beyond SPA is no longer significant, suggesting the better health of those who work at older ages is largely a selection effect. We have also shown that those in paid work past SPA tend to be multiply advantaged thus the extending working lives agenda has the potential to exacerbate later life inequality. In our work on unretirement we found that around 25 per cent experienced a retirement reversal after reporting being retired, about half of these reversals occurring within the first five years of retirement and almost all within eight. Unretirement was more common for participants who were male, more educated, in better health, owned a house with a mortgage (compared to owning it outright), and remained unmarried. However, unretirement rates were not higher for participants in greater financial need, whether measured as subjective assessment of finances or household income quintiles. These results suggest that unretirement is a strategy more often used by those who are already advantaged and that it has the potential to exacerbate income inequalities in later life. We have investigated the impact of working beyond SPA for frailty, showing that for women, experiencing distinct periods throughout the lifecourse of either work or family care may be advantageous for lessening frailty risk in later life. For men, leaving paid employment before 65 seems to be beneficial for decelerating increases in frailty thereafter. Continuous full-time work until retirement age conferred no long-term health benefits. In another analysis using ELSA we have explored whether changes in allostatic load and self-rated health predict changes in the number of hours worked each week for those over SPA. We show that men reduce their work commitments by about 0.3 hours per week for each additional allostatic load factor for which they are at risk, while no similar reduction is observed for women.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are holding another bespoke meeting with the Department of Work and Pensions at the end of April to discuss our findings to date.
