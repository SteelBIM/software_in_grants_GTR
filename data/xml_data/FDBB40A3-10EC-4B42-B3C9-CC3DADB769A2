The best way to model the rich variation in the appearance of real world materials is through measurements and this process of measuring the reflectance property of a material is referred to as reflectometry. Traditionally, reflectometry has involved carefully calibrated reflectance measurements under controlled illumination. This has limited the scope of these measurements to inside the laboratory and has hindered on-site measurements in general indoor or outdoor conditions. Here, we propose a novel approach to reflectometry with portable on-site acquisition based on off-the-shelf components. Specifically, we propose employing a mobile device such as a smartphone or a tablet for measuring the reflectance properties of flat material samples in general indoor environments. We propose to further extend reflectometry to general outdoor environments, where instead of relying on controlled incident illumination, we propose to estimate reflectance properties from measurements of polarization characteristics of reflected light as formalized by Stokes parameters in conjunction with multispectral imaging. Thus, this research aims to extend reflectometry for computer graphics and vision to general real world environments which has many potential applications in entertainment, cultural heritage and virtual reality.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Extension of surface reflectometry from controlled laboratory measurements to general indoor and
outdoor environments has many applications in computer graphics and vision. A major application area
is digitization of shape and reflectance of material samples for realistic modeling of digital props in the
entertainment industry for visual effects and video games. Reflectometry in outdoor environments has the
potential to impact the realism and quality of virtual reality and large scale visualization systems as well
as consumer applications such as Google StreetView/Earth and Microsoft's Phototourism. The mobile
platform for reflectometry has the potential to also benefit applications outside the entertainment industry
in areas such as digitization of cultural heritage artifacts in museums and art galleries for posterity
as well as interactive virtual visualization for the general public via new media technologies. There are
also possible applications in life sciences and medicine in digitzation of the surface appearance of biological
samples for digital preservation as well as analysis. Because our proposed research will lead to
techniques that can be used to create realistic virtual models relevant to various application areas, these
domains and the general public are all potential beneficiaries of the work.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98661</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Google Mountain View</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9014C99F-DAB8-4C7F-811B-B90C75ED60D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I (the PI) and PhD student Jeremy Riviere traveled to Google Mountain View, California to give a presentation to the virtual reality group at Google on the research conducted on mobile surface reflectometry.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The mobile surface reflectometry approach has found interest with Activision which is a reputed games company.

With the support of the grant, we have developed a user friendly portable approach for acquiring the surface reflectance properties of planar material samples using mobile devices (smartphone and tablets). This represents potentially a big leap forward for ease of content creation for virtual environments and creative industry applications such as visual effects and games. Our developed method/system can also be employed for digitization of planar artifacts for cultural heritage applications as well as material samples relevant to building and construction industry. The developed approach and method has been published in the Computer Graphics Forum journal and the work was presented at the Eurographics 2016 conference.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Reflectometry, the acquisition of reflectance properties of real world materials, had thus far been restricted to laboratory setups and expert operators. The proposed approach for mobile reflectometry can instead be easily used by non-experts for ease of content creation in digital media pipelines such as visual effects and games where digital artists can simply employ a mobile device to digitize the appearance of a particular material of interest and include it in a virtual environment. The approach could also be used for on-site digitization of cultural heritage artifacts and in other non-expert domains such as building and construction industry where there is extensive interest in virtual visualization of architectural designs with realistic visualization of various materials found in the built environment. Furthermore, there is an increasing interest in the retail sector for digitization of products for online shopping applications where the developed technique could be utilized.

Our current method for mobile acquisition of appearance is restricted to planar material samples. This could be extended in the future to mobile appearance acquisition of full three dimensional objects which would be very valuable for content creation for virtual reality applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E54F8646-1A23-47C9-8A21-F3F566E238A8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/project/mobile-surface-reflectometry/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C0D1924D-9718-4DE3-9FAD-DEBF47937FBB"><gtr:id>C0D1924D-9718-4DE3-9FAD-DEBF47937FBB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mobile Surface Reflectometry</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computer Graphics Forum</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b0656a418d7c7bd67b5171828a0d0873"><gtr:id>b0656a418d7c7bd67b5171828a0d0873</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Riviere J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M00192X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
