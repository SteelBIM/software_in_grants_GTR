Although the new chemistry produces an unnatural linkage, it can be read through by DNA polymerases, the enzymes that make new copies of DNA in living systems during cell division. Thus our new artificial DNA linkage is truly biocompatible. Unlike biological ligation, this chemical reaction can be carried out on both normal and chemically-modified DNA, on any scale under a wide range of physical conditions. This makes it useful for biotechnology, i.e. the large scale production of medicinally important biological constructs. We will use click ligation to make very long DNA strands, enabling the assembly of chemically-modified synthetic genes which can be used to make proteins. Our work will allow the insertion of structural motifs such as quadruplexes and chemical modifications such as methylated and hydroxymethylated bases into genes for the study of gene expression and epigenetics. These modifications are thought to switch genes on and off by mechanisms that are not yet fully understood. They are currently the focus of intense research as aberrant genetic switches are implicated in diseases such as cancer and also in ageing. We will make fluorescently labelled DNA and RNA constructs and we will use them to investigate the physical structures of genes (including gene loops) and to understand the dynamics of long-range interactions in chromatin, part of the structure of a chromosome, by super resolution microscopy. This will allow us to understand the relationship between the tight packaging of DNA in cells and its ability to regulate the synthesis of proteins. We will prepare fluorescently labelled RNA substrates to investigate mechanisms used by the influenza virus to make proteins and to replicate (copy) itself: theses phenomena will be studied by single-molecule FRET (a very sensitive technique for measuring distances between two fluorescent labels) and super-resolution imaging. This will help us to understand the biology of RNA viruses, an important step towards developing improved therapies. We will use click ligation to build artificial molecular machines that will be designed to carry out unique sets of chemical reactions in a precisely controlled manner. This technology may lead to new ways to develop biologically active compounds including drugs. An internationally-leading team from Southampton and Oxford has been assembled and extensive preliminary studies have been carried out to prove feasibility.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Click ligation is an extremely efficient method for joining DNA and RNA strands to produce an unnatural linkage at the site of ligation that can be replicated by DNA polymerases. Unlike biological ligation, it can be carried out on both normal and chemically-modified DNA, on any scale, under a wide range of physical conditions, making it particularly useful for biotechnology. Click ligation will be used for the enzyme-free synthesis of very long DNA strands, enabling the assembly of chemically-modified synthetic genes and plasmids for in vivo applications. The project will open up new areas in synthetic biology, allowing the insertion of structural motifs such as quadruplexes, methylated and hydroxymethylated bases into genes for the studies of the control of gene expression and of epigenetics. We will investigate gene loops and their relationship to non-coding RNA and transcription to understand the dynamics of long range chromatin interactions in yeast by super resolution microscopy using long synthetic click DNA templates containing fluorescent nucleotides at defined sites. We will prepare chemically modified, fluorescently labelled RNA substrates for the study of influenza viral transcription and replication using single-molecule FRET and super-resolution imaging. This will provide unprecedented opportunities to observe these mechanisms and will contribute to the development of models of transcription and gene expression in general, thus benefiting both systems and synthetic biology. We will extend the scope of synthetic biology through combinatorial nanostructure assembly by building molecular machines that are controlled by synthetic genes assembed by click ligation, and by using click ligation to create combinatorial libraries of functional nanostructures. An internationally-leading team from Southampton and Oxford has been assembled and extensive preliminary studies have been carried out to prove feasibility.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We propose to exploit a new technology (click ligation) for joining synthetic nucleic acid fragments by chemical methods. This versatile technique can generate long pieces of DNA or RNA that contain specific modifications, which can be used in synthetic biology, chemical biology, molecular biology and nanotechnology. Site-specific incorporation of modifications such as fluorescent labels and methylated bases cannot be achieved by conventional (enzymic and biological) methods. An internationally-leading team from Southampton and Oxford has been assembled to demonstrate the power of this technology in a number of research areas, including the preparation of synthetic genes; the generation of plasmids that contain permanent unusual DNA structures; the effects of specific methylation patterns in epigenetics; a mechanistic analysis of influenza viral transcription and replication using clicked RNAs; and the generation of combinatorial libraries of functional nanostructures. The potential applications of this technology extend well beyond these examples and the full potential impact of this reseach will be achieved if our technology is widely adopted in other areas of fundamental and applied research that could benefit from the facile preparation of long nucleic acids which contain modifications at specific positions. The main beneficiaries from this research will be those involved in fundamental and applied research in the fields of chemical biology, synthetic biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, and genomics whose research will benefit from the adoption of our methods. It is therefore important for the results to be rapidly communicated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed scientific journals, general-interest publications, university seminars, conference lectures and posters, webpages. The Universities have dedicated Media Centres to aid with public announcements and production of newsletters, web pages and social networking blogs to further inform the public of the research. This multidisciplinary project will provide training for post-doctoral workers at the interface between Chemistry and Biology. Scientists who can collaborate across wide range of disciplines will have an impact that goes beyond the five years of this project with long-term benefits to the UK research base and wider impacts on society and the economy. PhD students and undergraduate project students in our laboratories will also benefit from interaction with this work. Southampton and Oxford are research intensive Universities and our research activities inform the final year undergraduate teaching. Exploitation of the results will be coordinated through Southampton University's Research and Innovation Services and Oxford University's intellectual property company Isis Innovation. These organizations support world-class research by focusing on its impact on national and global economies and society. They have excellent track records of developing and maintaining relationships with external partners and exploiting research outputs for the benefit of society. The involvement of an SME (atdbio Ltd) will provide a further means for exploiting the technology and will ensure that the project will increase UK competitiveness. The wider public will also benefit from the applicants' engagement with the 'public understanding of science' through public lectures, university Science and Engineering days and other open days. The activities are supported by members of the research team including PhD students and postdoctoral researchers. The general public have considerable interest in DNA and are generally keen to learn more about its properties. The applicants will therefore continue to be involved in visits to local schools to give lectures on a wide variety of topics relating to nucleic acids. We have included communication skills and media training in the budget to ensure that we explain their importance of our work to a wide audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1659227</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics</gtr:department><gtr:description>EM structural studies</gtr:description><gtr:id>E03BA667-D247-47B2-A9BD-5BA511FB9C58</gtr:id><gtr:impact>24155385</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner provided expertise, data analysis and access to equipment to perform structural analysis by electron microscopy.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provided material for structural studies using electron microscopy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics</gtr:department><gtr:description>3D structural studies of the influenza virus RNA polymerase</gtr:description><gtr:id>F05EE547-DE82-42F2-AB1C-F380648DDF13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Establishing expression and purification protocols for the influenza virus RNA polymerase for structural studies.

Techniques that we have developed for the creation of libraries of molecules, from which those with particular properties can be selected, will be developed with the aim of creating a new technology that can be applied to, e.g., the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds.
We have developed an autonomous system for programmed chemical synthesis based on synthetic molecular machinery constructed by DNA self-assembly. This system makes use of click ligation to create a record of reaction steps, a synthetic 'gene', which can be amplified (by cloning) and read back to identify reaction products. We have demonstrated the creation of small combinatorial libraries of oligomers and plan to develop the technology as a tool for molecular discovery, a key element of which is the autonomous, genetically programmed synthesis of combinatorial libraries of oligomers, with natural and unnatural backbones and side chains, from which function molecules (e.g. antimicrobial agents) can be selected. The importance of click ligation in this process is that it is effective in reaction conditions that would be incompatible with enzymatic ligation, allowing us to explore the full potential of synthetic, non-ribosomal systems for programmed synthesis of abiotic compounds. We have also explored the construction of DNA-based molecular motors as potential components in the next generations of molecular assembly lines.

2) The influenza virus is a member of a class of viruses that includes some of the most important human, animal and plant pathogens, such as rabies and Ebola virus. Understanding the mechanisms of the RNAP of the influenza virus is essential to further basic research into the virus, as well as aiding in the development of novel therapeutics against this potentially deadly infectious disease and stimulating work on other viruses belonging to this class of pathogens. Furthermore, through our studies we have developed novel single-molecule techniques and instrumentation that are applicable to the study of many biological processes involving protein-nucleic acid interactions.
Crystal structures of the in?uenza RNA polymerase (RNAP) have provided intriguing static snapshots of how the viral RNA genome is bound and copied. We have built upon our expertise in structural analysis of the influenza virus RNAP (Hengrung et al. Nature 527:114, 2015) and single-molecule studies of the interactions of the influenza virus RNAP with viral RNA (Tomescu, Robb et al. PNAS 111:E3335, 2014) to probe the RNA conformational rearrangements occurring during RNAP binding and replication. Using a highly sensitive, solution-based single-molecule FRET assay to measure distances between fluorophores located on the viral RNA promoter or RNAP, we showed that the polymerase-bound RNA exists in two conformations, corresponding to pre-initiation and initiation states (Robb et al. NAR 44(21):10304, 2016). This work allows us to propose a model of the dynamic processes that occur during early influenza virus RNA synthesis and provides novel insights into the replication mechanisms of the influenza virus RNA genome. 
In addition to our in vitro single molecule FRET work, we have also carried out in vivo experiments to study the interactions of the influenza virus and host cellular machineries. In particular, we have used multi-colour super-resolution imaging to investigate sites of viral transcription and replication in the host cell, thought to occur in distinct locations in the nucleus in close proximity to sites of cellular transcription/RNA processing. We have shown that viral ribonucleoprotein complexes form large 'super-clusters' within the nucleus; work is currently ongoing to further determine the exact nature of these large complexes.

3) CRISPR and the related technique of CRISPRi has revolutionized our ability to study genomes, genes and gene expression. A challenge when using the technology is linking many different nucleic acid binding regions to the core dCAS9 handle on the sgRNAs. CLICK chemistry offers a tractable solution to this problem and we have shows that CLICK chemistry is an effective way of producing sgRNAs. Using these constructs we have effectively knocked down transcription and examined the consequences. The impact of this work is to show how CLICK chemistry can be successfully applied to address pertinent biological problems in cells.
We have used CLICK chemistry to produce customised sgRNAs (linking multiple base pairing regions regions to the constant Cas9 handle region) for strand-specific repression of transcription in yeast. Tests show that the sgRNA produced using CLICK chemistry function identically to those produced from synthetic DNA. This offers an alternative method for producing sgRNA libraries for genome wide interrogation of transcription. 
We have studied transcription at selected loci using our CLICKED CRISPRi constructs. Our results show that contrary to the published literature, CRISPRi is not strand-specific. To do this we have examined the effect of CRISPRi at loci having well-characterised sense and antisense transcription. At HMS2 inhibition of antisense transcription using catalytically dead Cas9 also result in premature truncation of the overlapping sense transcript. Moreover, inhibiting the native antisense transcript leads to the production of an internally initiated shorter antisense transcript that also extends into the HMS2 sense promoter and represses expression. We show that CRISPRi functions best at genes subject to low levels of nascent transcription.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>With our collaborators in Southampton University, we are demonstrating and publishing a wide range of applications of click ligation, providing technical and scientific data and application examples to underpin the wider uptake and development of this new technology. Specific findings will form the basis of protected intellectual property, and may be developed through, e.g., licencing agreements through Oxford University Innovation and Southampton University's Research and Innovation Services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B8AC3F9D-C99E-44F2-ADFE-23EA809131F6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C0F5BAC1-9534-45CA-89B8-AE46C23C1BE3"><gtr:id>C0F5BAC1-9534-45CA-89B8-AE46C23C1BE3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Single-molecule FRET reveals the pre-initiation and initiation conformations of influenza virus promoter RNA.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2407fd7d5caa31c3e3af799cea483528"><gtr:id>2407fd7d5caa31c3e3af799cea483528</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Robb NC</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D09B77F7-AA6C-47D0-AD21-1A869F383E93"><gtr:id>D09B77F7-AA6C-47D0-AD21-1A869F383E93</gtr:id><gtr:title>In vivo single-RNA tracking shows that most tRNA diffuses freely in live bacteria.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nucleic acids research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/23e05d1a4782bb670e69e7edf57ee579"><gtr:id>23e05d1a4782bb670e69e7edf57ee579</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Plochowietz A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0305-1048</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A8CEC2A3-5483-4DA1-B433-68D4320CE0D5"><gtr:id>A8CEC2A3-5483-4DA1-B433-68D4320CE0D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Formal Language and Design Principles of Autonomous DNA Walker Circuits.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ACS synthetic biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/520394692f9224e3ceb9964c5a69fb80"><gtr:id>520394692f9224e3ceb9964c5a69fb80</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Boemo MA</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2161-5063</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E40CB622-0028-4A34-B341-7434ED63133C"><gtr:id>E40CB622-0028-4A34-B341-7434ED63133C</gtr:id><gtr:title>DNA walker circuits: computational potential, design, and verification</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Natural Computing</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2e0df1a0516db473c1db46a0e712223e"><gtr:id>2e0df1a0516db473c1db46a0e712223e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dannenberg F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/996A39F9-B21E-4DB6-85FD-7854493E2FC0"><gtr:id>996A39F9-B21E-4DB6-85FD-7854493E2FC0</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of the priming loop in Influenza A virus RNA synthesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature microbiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e48314490dc77e7284a9ec13d5962eeb"><gtr:id>e48314490dc77e7284a9ec13d5962eeb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Te Velthuis AJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2058-5276</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F92757AD-1207-4D40-AC84-D1C6CE4FE8A2"><gtr:id>F92757AD-1207-4D40-AC84-D1C6CE4FE8A2</gtr:id><gtr:title>An autonomous molecular assembler for programmable chemical synthesis.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cda1ffbe8421ab61a0fe8f970c86480b"><gtr:id>cda1ffbe8421ab61a0fe8f970c86480b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Meng W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1755-4330</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6202D7C8-6551-44A6-992F-3C6380BBC28D"><gtr:id>6202D7C8-6551-44A6-992F-3C6380BBC28D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Stable end-sealed DNA as robust nano-rulers for in vivo single-molecule fluorescence</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Chem.
