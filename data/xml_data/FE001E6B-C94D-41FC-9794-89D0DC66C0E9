They are distinct in ways that have a relevance to teaching and learning, including questions related to attention span and information searching patterns. At the same time universities in the UK have been exploring a more extensive use of e-learning. The policy direction emphasises learners? needs and aspirations but we have little empirical evidence of the changing student population. This research will aim to explore students coming from the Net generation as they first encounter e-learning at university.
&lt;br />
&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;The aim of the research is to provide an empirically based understanding of the Net Generation as they enter university. The research will use a mixture of survey methods, interview and observation to achieve the following objectives:
&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;
&lt;br />
&lt;br />
&lt;ol>
 &lt;li>To explore their attitudes, expectations and experience of e-learning at university.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>To explore any linkages between their prior exposure to gaming and digital networked technology and their expressed attitudes towards and experience of e-learning.&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>To investigate the use of social software&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>To develop the theoretical basis for understanding any generational changes&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>To provide timely evidence based advice for policy makers, teaching staff and administrators&lt;/li>

Yet many students couldn't bear to be without their mobile phones and find themselves distracted by social networking sites during study. These are the some of the findings from research funded by the Economic and Social Research Council into how today's generation of students use technology. The research, led by Dr Christopher Jones of the Open University, surveyed and interviewed over two thousand first year students at 5 English universities.
&amp;quot;Our research shows that the argument for a sharp generational break between today's generation of young people who are immersed in new technologies and older generations who are less familiar with technology is flawed,&amp;quot; concludes Dr Jones. &amp;quot;The diverse ways that young people use technology today show the argument is too simplistic and that new single generation, often called the net generation, with high skill levels in technology does not exist.&amp;quot; The research's findings included:
? Almost all owned a mobile phone (97.8%), just over three quarters owned a laptop (77.4%) and over a third (38.1%) owned a desktop computer. Over two thirds (70.1%) felt their access to computers was sufficient to meet their computing needs, and the mobile phone was chosen by 83.2% as the device students would miss most if they did not have access to it. However, the surveys also revealed a small minority of students who either didn't use email or have access to mobile phones.
? The age of students influenced their use of technologies. Students who were 20 years or younger reported being more frequently engaged in instant messaging, sending text by a mobile phone, participating in social networks, downloading or streaming TV or video and uploading images, audio and video onto social networking sites than students aged 25 years or more. For example, only 4.3% of those aged 20 or younger never used social networking websites compared to 78.5% of those aged 35 years or older. The younger students also used information and communication technologies for social life and leisure more frequently whilst older students were more likely to use them for study.
? In their studies, students used new technologies more than they were required by the course. This was particularly marked for instant messaging and social networks. However, certain new technologies were only used by a minority of students: contributing to blogs (21.5%) and wikis (12.1%) or using a virtual world (2%). 
? Despite the major advances in technology, students still inhabit the same kinds of learning spaces they used ten years ago. They continue to study in their bedrooms, the university library or other dedicated study spaces at the university; this is despite the ability with mobile devices and broadband to study anywhere. 
? The distracting nature of technologies, such as social networking sites, email and mobile phones, was commonly cited in the interviews but also happily accepted. Most students had developed ways to cope with the distractions while studying. These ranged from switching off the sources of distraction to taking breaks for social networking. 
? The more students used a new technology, the more competent they believed they were in using it. There was little difference in the reported IT skill levels between the sexes, except male students were more confident than female students in their use of spreadsheets, graphics, audio/video, computer maintenance and security. However, university staff noted that whilst students had wide exposure to technology they often lacked in-depth knowledge of specialized pieces of software and of spreadsheets in particular. 
? There was little evidence that today's students enter university with demands for new technologies that teachers and universities cannot meet. Rather many students reported initial surprise or confusion at the array of technologies that were available at their university, but few thought that this led to long-term difficulties. While teachers who are prepared to develop their skills with the new technologies and to integrate them carefully into their courses are unlikely to be held back by their membership of a preceding generation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The idea that there are significant generational differences between age groups with regard to their use of digital and networked technologies persists despite repeated scientific findings to the contrary. The findings reported in 2010 largely preceded the widespread use of smartphones and the research could be usefully updated to take account of this change and to explore the persistence and continued use of terms such as 'digital native' and 'net generation' despite their lack of a scientific basis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A66CA0D7-1400-4321-8BB2-A7F0D1EF57B0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/547561DB-114F-498C-9158-64D924DA8A32"><gtr:id>547561DB-114F-498C-9158-64D924DA8A32</gtr:id><gtr:title>Net generation students: agency and choice and the new technologies</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Computer Assisted Learning</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0"><gtr:id>eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C2EEB9C2-E8B8-414C-ACA1-770E9CD6D323"><gtr:id>C2EEB9C2-E8B8-414C-ACA1-770E9CD6D323</gtr:id><gtr:title>Networks and locations for student learning</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Learning, Media and Technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0"><gtr:id>eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7C019C19-C1F7-46A1-9822-C2BC2B02F2EC"><gtr:id>7C019C19-C1F7-46A1-9822-C2BC2B02F2EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Net generation or Digital Natives: Is there a distinct new generation entering university?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Computers &amp; Education</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0"><gtr:id>eb717bce2e3d9f5f8e2e0fd9de5431d0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FF2573D9-5DF6-4D23-B10A-B374817ACC4C"><gtr:id>FF2573D9-5DF6-4D23-B10A-B374817ACC4C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Is there a net generation coming to university</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb"><gtr:id>18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chris Jones (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5715ED9-FE72-4A1E-9C1B-314CF87BABF9"><gtr:id>D5715ED9-FE72-4A1E-9C1B-314CF87BABF9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Profiling university students' use of technology : where is the net generation divide</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The international journal of technology knowledge and society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb"><gtr:id>18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chris Jones (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/16DFAE37-315A-4251-BF7D-5E93E469222A"><gtr:id>16DFAE37-315A-4251-BF7D-5E93E469222A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The net generation enters university : what are the implications for technology enhanced learning</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb"><gtr:id>18c0592c00c9ce1c1406f0562056eccb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chris Jones (author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C089DE7A-984E-4EC9-8C1A-4CE3265768C8"><gtr:id>C089DE7A-984E-4EC9-8C1A-4CE3265768C8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Describing or debunking?
