parameters and exotic excitations</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J022004/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Experiments on liquid helium-three near the absolute zero of temperature have played a key role in the development of many central concepts in condensed matter physics. The discovery of superfluid 3He gave us the first p-wave superfluid, a model for unconventional superconductivity, in which the pairing breaks the symmetry of the parent normal metal. Since that time the international programme of materials discovery has thrown up many new unconventional superconductors. And formally the phases of superfluid 3He can be regarded as a quantum vacua, with parallels in particle physics and cosmology [see &amp;quot;The Universe in a Helium Droplet&amp;quot;, G.E.Volovik].

Recently the topology (in momentum space) of condensed matter systems has been widely applied as a powerful scheme for their classification, alongside the concept of broken symmetry. The simple truths of topology (eg a sphere's surface cannot be continuously deformed into that of a torus) have a powerful impact when applied to complex interacting quantum systems, by pointing to phenomena that must be there, independent of microscopic details; robust protection is conferred by the inviolable constraints of topology. This may lead to electronic devices whose operation relies on the laws of quantum mechanics in a way immune to environmental disturbance, a vision that is supported by Microsoft's Station Q and associated programmes.

In this programme we will study the topological superfluidity of helium-three confined in regular nanofabricated geometries, as a model system to further our understanding of topological quantum matter. Our experiments will exploit the recent technical breakthroughs we have made in quantum nanofluidics, and the development of sensitive NMR techniques based on the detection of the precessing magnetic signal by SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices).

Confinement of superfluid 3He in a slab-like cavity of thickness of order the diameter of the Cooper pairs, has a profound effect on the superfluid order and is expected to stabilize new superfluid states of matter. The compressibility of 3He allows the pair diameter to be pressure-tuned, varying the effective confinement. Regular geometries can be fabricated with well-characterized surfaces, which can be tuned in situ by plating with a helium-4 film. This exquisite geometrical control and tuneability, coupled to the ideal material qualities of superfluid 3He, and highly developed microscopic models provide a rigorous theory-experiment interface.
 
Phases with different topologies are expected to be stable under different conditions, and we will map the effect of our new control parameter, confinement, on these phases. We will quantify the role of disorder, arising from surface roughness, and the importance of quantum size effects. These topological superfluids support novel excitations at the faces or edges of the cavity, at domain walls and vortices. The precise character of these excitations depends on whether the superfluid ground state preserves or breaks time reversal symmetry. At the surface of the B-phase they are propagating Majorana fermions, and we will search for these as part of the project.

This project has a strong international collaborative dimension, both experimental and theoretical, closely partnering with Cornell and Northwestern in the USA, and PTB (Berlin) in Germany, and exploiting our membership of the European Microkelvin Collaboration. We will connect with other programmes on topological quantum matter in the UK and internationally, enhanced by the Hubbard Theory Consortium, through its visitors programmes and workshops.

The project is expected to lead to fundamental insights into topological quantum matter and topological superfluidity/superconductivity in particular. It will drive the innovation of new instrumentation at the new frontier combining ultra-low temperatures and nanoscience, and new SQUID NMR techniques of broad applicability.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
 This research contributes to a fundamental understanding of both topological quantum matter and the practical feasibility of topologically protected quantum computing, a key long term challenge. The understanding of thin films of p-wave superfluids ultimately benefits manufacturers of future devices of novel functionality based on new materials (eg unconventional superconductors). The development of cryogenic instrumentation and novel state-of-the-art measurement systems directly benefits the scientific instruments industry and users, including cryogenics and superconducting technologies industries, National Measurement Institutes, medical diagnostics.
 Our expertise allows us to contribute advice to international funding agencies and scientific academies, and to engage with national laboratories. The embedded collaboration between the UK, mainland Europe and USA groups, and the links to Japanese groups significantly widens the communities who will benefit. The general public, including young people, is potentially excited and motivated such research.
 How will they benefit?
 Superfluid helium-three provides a test-bed for evolving theories of topological quantum matter. International networking with theorists, enhanced by the Hubbard Theory Consortium, ensures that ideas developed in helium physics propagate, influencing the materials discovery agenda as well as guiding the development of novel devices based in topological quantum matter and p-wave superconductors. The universality of the topological classification of condensed matter systems is new and exciting, and adds significantly to the established notions of new phases classified by their broken symmetries. Advances in fundamental understanding enter the canon of the subject, contribute to scientific progress and enhance the quality of life through unanticipated channels.
 Such research acts as a magnet for the best young talent. It combines techniques at the frontiers of nanofluidics, ultralow temperature physics, measurement techniques, and addresses key theoretical concepts. Our experimental work revolves around custom design of equipment and instrumentation, the mastery of design skills and construction techniques, developing high precision measurement techniques and associated data acquisition schemes, data analysis, modelling; it involves managing the interaction with theorists. The rigorous training of highly skilled manpower, and the transfer of their expertise, enhances our economic competitiveness.
 The cryogenic industry will benefit by contributions to the development of new refrigerator products with enhanced capabilities. The development of quantum nanofluidics helps open up nanoscience to the ultra-low temperature frontier. Combining nanoscience with ultralow temperature technology challenges us to develop new experimental methods. Developments in the applications of superconducting devices to NMR, made through this research, will be further advanced by collaborations with end users and will lead to novel MRI modalities, new techniques for NMR spectroscopy and biodiagnostics. The wider public, including school children, will benefit through a portfolio of outreach activities. 
What will be done to ensure that they benefit?
 Collaboration arrangements include: an established network with scientific instruments industry (eg Oxford Instruments Nanoscience) and standards laboratories (NPL and PTB); membership of the European MicroKelvin Collaboration, with dedicated activities for interaction and knowledge exchange. Joint workshops will be held involving the EPSRC funded TOPNES programme. Export of trained manpower; exploitation of novel instrumentation through national knowledge exchange schemes, such as HEIF, and the people pipeline. Wider communication and engagement activities will centre on outreach activities organised through our physics outreach officer; international conference and workshop participation and organisation.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1140434</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cornell University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cornell University</gtr:description><gtr:id>1E076B9A-376A-4700-8D5A-54C28BBDA5C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Fabrication of nanofluidic sample chambers.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaborative research on superfluid helium-3.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)</gtr:department><gtr:description>PTB_SQUIDs</gtr:description><gtr:id>6CE31165-C060-46A5-8C83-9DD87F2FEF8B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publications.

The 50+ teachers present will all go one to teach hundred's of students each, so the aim is that this excitement can be conveyed to thousands of students across the network.

Feedback from the event organisers/participants was that the lecture scored 3.8/4 (one of the highest rated events during the summer school).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.stimulatingphysics.org/index.htm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk.

During the event Dr. Andrew Casey ran a series of lectures and demonstration about temperatures in the Universe and how experimental physicists can reach even lower temperatures in the laboratory. The talk was repeated 6 times throughout the event to audiences of around 200 people each time, reaching over a thousand people.

As a model system for topological quantum matter, particularly since no topological superconductor has been definitively identified, the anticipated intellectual impact is high. Topological quantum matter is a well-documented recent revolution in the understanding of materials, with important potential long term applications.
A significant and wide impact in the shorter term derives from the recognised importance of research on matter under extreme conditions, in particular low temperatures. Developing capability in this sector, and enhancing measurement technique, metrology and instrumentation, is a key feature of this research, and we have contributed in several ways. This impact has been achieved through close collaboration with the industrial sector (primarily Oxford Instruments Nanoscience) and National Measurement Institutes, and was the subject of an Impact Case Study to REF2014. 
This study was highlighted in the Institute of Physics 2015 publication &amp;quot;Inspirational physics for a modern economy, http://www.iop.org/publications/iop/2015/page_65902.html
Joint research with Oxford Instruments on cryogen-free microkelvin technology was subsequently highlighted at a special session at the APS March meeting in 2015. Progress on noise thermometry was featured at a Royal Society meeting at Chicheley Hall in May 2015, &amp;quot;Towards implementing the new kelvin&amp;quot;, a project involving collaboration across National Measurement Institutes in the EU.
Ongoing collaboration with Oxford Instruments is to complete a fully engineered sub-mK cryogen free ultralow temperature platform prototype at Royal Holloway
A further instrument for promoting impact is our membership of the European Microkelvin Consortium, funded under the EC Infrastructures programme (FP7). Horizon 2020 funding is being sought for the European Microkelvin Platform www.emplatform.eu. Engagement with a wide community of researchers and industrial partners is a key feature of this Platform, which operates at the European level, and with strong international connectivity.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2DA93331-6BC4-41F8-A3B6-FEF937717F53</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has opened up the study of superfluid 3He (a topological superfluid) under controlled nanoscale confinement. Two different approaches to cavity construction have been adopted. This has been combined with state-of-the-art SQUID NMR measurements, sensitive enough to allow measurements on a single cavity.
The focus, to date, has been on simple slab-like cavities of different heights. 
The profound influence on confinement on the superfluid phase diagram, in particular the relative stability of the A and B phases has been established. We have shown that the superfluid boundary conditions can be tuned in-situ. Two distinct orientations of the B-phase order parameter have been identified. Importantly this has allowed us to determine the surface induced distortion of the B-phase order parameter.
A search has been conducted for the predicted spatially modulated (striped) superfluid phase. The NMR response provides hints of a new phase, and the results are currently being modelled.
Experiments have been performed in a 200 nm high cavity, to test the influence of surface scattering conditions on the suppression of superfluidity. For diffuse scattering the quasiclassical theory of Tc suppression has been precisely confirmed for the first time. By coating the surface with a superfluid 4He film we achieve close to specular scattering, for which Tc is unsuppressed. This is a key result: it means we can shrink the height of the cavity towards the two-dimensional limit. The topology of the superfluid phase stable in this limit is unknown. This impacts broadly on the field of topological quantum matter. Here topological superconductors is an important class of material: but no bulk topological superconductors have been identified in nature. Topological superfluid 3He fills that gap.
Two new generation of nanofluidic cells are in design or fabrication. Some of these should solve technical problems encountered with earlier generation cells. They involve more complex cavity geometries and represent the beginning of a new direction: hybrid superfluid nanostructures.
Excitations bound to interfaces and surfaces (including majorana fermions) are one object of interest. New order parameters are the other.
Our work starts an entirely new field: topological mesoscopic superfluidity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project continues at this time.
