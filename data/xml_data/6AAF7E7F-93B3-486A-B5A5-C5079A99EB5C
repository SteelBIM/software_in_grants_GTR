This research proposes an investigation into cultural exchange as an act of translation. It will focus on the transformations sought through the exchange of artists, artistic production and artistic methodologies. With the support of British Council and Arts Council England, THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE forges a research collaboration between QMUL and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro that will map the current terrain of Anglo-Brazilian cultural exchanges. With a particular focus on UK exchanges with arts organizations emerging from Rio de Janeiro's peripheral urban territories, the research will extend analysis of how innovations in the social technologies of the arts seek to translate the city and transform lives.

The research project will ask what happens when artists translate ideas and practices from one cultural context to another: what gets lost and what gets learned in the adaptation? How are those who make the translations themselves transformed? How mutual is the act of translation and how sustainable is the process of transformation? If translation is, as is often said, a betrayal then how do we understand and evaluate the importance of the gaps and losses that open up during the process?

Through a mapping of Anglo-Brazilian arts and cultural exchange projects produced during the transition between two stagings of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (2012-2016), this project will research how we can create new ways of practising the art of cultural exchange. In the context of an intense interest in creating new cultural dialogues with Brazil in recent and coming years, this project will ask how the UK and Brazil translate each other inflected through cultural exchanges mediated by voices from the periphery. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE will investigate how the emergent 'interpreters' and intermediaries of Brazil's own peripheries are engaged in a process of translation through cultural exchanges that can re-interpret UK social realities. The translators in this instance will include young artists and cultural activists emerging in Rio de Janeiro through a series of arts-based projects in favelas and peripheral communities, who will be direct participants in the research process. It will also link these particular artists, organisations and movements to other peripheral Brazilian cultural manifestations, both contemporary and historic.

The research will offer an opportunity to examine processes of cultural exchange involving Brazilian arts practitioners collaborating with a range of UK arts organisations, as they seek to translate ideas, ideologies and forms of knowledge into new contexts. Arts and cultural policy debates in the UK over the last decade have struggled to resist a dualism in which the need to maintain the aesthetic 'excellence' of the artistic endeavour is pitted against the search for a new social purpose and value for the arts. This proposed research project will connect to, build on and contribute to those debates, investigating how radical Brazilian ideas and practices can bring fresh perspectives, alternative frameworks and different ways of working. The investigation will be a collaboration between academics, artists, policy makers, social and cultural agencies to discover other models for cultural exchanges. It will open up the possibilities of different approaches and methodologies for UK arts organizations and policy makers, and aims to contribute to the strengthening of cultural and academic dialogues between Brazil and the UK. THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE looks to the peripheral urban territories of Rio de Janeiro for an exchange that offers new ways to translate our own values and experiences in the UK, providing a challenge to ideas that characterise so much of our own cultural debates and perhaps by extension the very idea of translation itself.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Governments: DCMS and the Brazilian Ministry of Culture have created a framework for arts and cultural exchange between UK and Brazil (MoU 2010). This research will contribute to understanding how ideas and practices can be more effectively shared, circulated and transmitted under this cooperation. Heritage (PI) has advised both governments on the ways in which the UK and Brazil can collaborate in the development of new knowledge and understanding in relation to cultural policy, and this research project will extend the ways in which they can create effective shared initiatives. International cultural initiatives developed by the Greater London Authority and LOCOG have facilitated engagement with Rio de Janeiro to build the legacy of 2012, and this research will seek to enhance new strategic collaborations with the cultural secretariats of the state and municipal governments of Rio de Janeiro.
Public sector: British Council, Arts Council England and the Brazilian National Foundation for the Arts/FUNARTE &amp;amp; Ministry of Culture have all expressed strong support for this research as a means of interrogating their own practices in the anticipation that it will contribute to the development of new and more effective ways of initiating and nurturing cultural dialogue. Through their close links with the cultural teams of the Public Olympic Authority (APO) and the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Rio2016), the research team will establish at least one case study that is linked to the Olympic and Paralympic cultural dialogue between London and Rio in order to enhance understanding of the ways in which cultural exchange is inflected and mediated within the wider context of global mega-events. It will also encourage the establishment of international cultural exchanges that extend to and include peripheral communities and territories within the Olympic and Paralympic cultural programme.
Third Sector: UK-based charitable trusts and foundations that promote international cultural programmes (such as the Gulbenkian, Clore Duffield, Jerwood) are often the most active and agile in investigating new ideas and practices. The PI and People's Palace Projects (arts-based research centre and charitable organization at QMUL) work closely with third sector cultural institutions and invite senior representatives to contribute to the proposed seminars. Further circulation and transmission of the research will be encouraged through the trusts and foundations' own mechanisms of dissemination and debate.
Arts organizations: At least 12 arts organizations in UK and Brazil will be directly engaged through the 6 case studies, benefiting from the new understanding within their own practices and the comparative learning with other organizations engaged in parallel processes. Further arts organizations will participate in the 2 seminars and the research will be promoted widely across the arts sector through the networks of the Arts Council England, British Council and FUNARTE (who have offered infrastructural support for the research and its dissemination).
The media: Traditional UK media (newspapers, radio and television) will be actively looking for legacy links between London and Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and the PI will work closely with the QMUL communication team to enable access by journalists to stories and ideas emerging from the research. Many of the artists and cultural thinkers from peripheral territories (UK/Brazil) are extremely active agents in social media and will be transmitting and circulating ideas and provocations throughout the research process.
Local communities: The research is focused on translating processes by which Brazilian peripheral arts organizations transform their communities through becoming new intermediaries and agents in the transmission of knowledge. The impact of this research on a wider public in the UK will be through the translation of these practices through the process of cultural exchange.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>22 minute documentary film by indigenous filmmaker Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro, turning the anthropological observation skills he learned in Brazil on the population of London.

Drawing from their experience as students, young artists and cultural entrepreneurs living in the peripheries of London, Manchester, Cardiff and Rio de Janeiro, the workshop aimed at developing their reflection skills, supporting the building of networks and exchange of experience shaping and producing arts projects in collaboration with practitioners from a diverse range of backgrounds.

Partnerships with organisations operating in these areas whose Directors were present in the meeting were established and a initial plan was designed in collaboration with them. 

Meeting attended by senior researchers and policy makers based at major universities, arts organisations and with experience in diverse roles within the industry, including the British Council and major arts sponsor Petrobras.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Live tweeting the London seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4455C2B8-7E70-4756-9352-25B72434FDAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The London Seminar's proceedings were captured and disseminated in 86 live tweets sent throughout the day on PPP's twitter feed (1,044 followers as of 2017).

The final report of the programme is to be produced shortly.

The learning from the programme has fed in to discussions among peers and with AHRC that are helping to inform AHRC's policy and management structures for Global Challenges Research Fund.

Outputs from the research have been made available to a wide variety of arts organisations and the general public, e.g. screenings of Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro's film &amp;quot;London as a Village&amp;quot; which has increased understanding and awareness of Brazilian indigenous culture in the UK and vice versa, and influenced AIKAX's desire to set up a new collaboration with People's Palace Projects that seeks to use cultural exchange as a tool to support economic development within the community and raise awareness of Kuikuro culture more widely in Brazil and the world.

Paul Heritage's article, drawing on the research, has been reprinted in programmes for Complicite's 'The Encounter' on its UK and world tours during which it has been seen by over 100,000 people to date. Paul Heritage also contributed to a series of post show discussions during the Edinburgh Festival and London Barbican runs, some with Takum&amp;atilde; Kuikuro.

Circo Crescer e Viver selected Shakespeare as a theme for the first show by a Brazilian circus company integrating disabled performers, partly as a result of participating in the research into the ways Shakespeare has been used by Brazilian artists in various contexts, using Shakespeare's &amp;quot;universalizing&amp;quot; position to raise the voices of excluded communities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>25A58547-8DF4-4645-950D-D405A3047874</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>THE ART OF CULTURAL EXCHANGE project has assisted understanding for policy makers and arts organisations/researchers alike of: 

1. The extent, reach, impact and nature of the cultural exchange between Brazil and the UK between 2012 and 2016 (with particular emphasis on the Olympic legacy projects between London2012 and Rio2016)

2. A range of significant methodological features of cultural projects seeking international collaboration and partnership to take forward issues of social development in peripheral territories and communities

3. How a better understanding of effective practices in cultural exchange can be identified and developed into cultural policy.


The research has revealed how:

4. cultural exchange can be productive as a shared search for active art practices that are social, territorial and engaged in the construction of communities

5. the discernible shift from a focus on homogenised and often pasteurised notions of national identity as defining the purpose, content and shape of international cultural exchanges has enabled alternative voices and practices to emerge that are often far from stable in the internal exchanges within their own country. The process of international exchange is an effective and often powerful means of affirming marginal artistic and social identities at 'home'

6. exchanges between the UK and Brazil go beyond the borders created by the accidents of migration and the restrictions which seek to hold art practices in place so as to redefine what we can be in the world. 

7. the routes taken during the most revealing exchanges rarely follow the paths that have been sign-posted in advance. There is no map, no compass, no clock, no manual that can adequately predict, gauge, measure, define or even record the multiple, unpredictable, unquantifiable exchanges that are made through the process of artistic collaborations across cultures. Our research demonstrates the inadequacies of the instruments we have for translation and the richness of the consequent invention when participants truly trust to open the unknown.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>- Arts organisations will be able to consult the research as a means of understanding how cultural exchange programmes can be most effectively constructed. 

- Policy makers and funding agencies can use the research to understand where and how cultural exchange is most effective and what steps need to be taken to increase reach, diversity and impact of investment

- Academics can use both the analysis and the range of raw material presented by the case studies as the basis for further research. The theoretical questions laid out in the position papers and the revelations of past/current/future trends in mapping can be used as the basis for further interdisciplinary study.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5303156D-E5F8-4294-8411-6D1ED0D79EC2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information
