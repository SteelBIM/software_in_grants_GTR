This study will challenge that presumption by examining modes of migrant identification and pathways of integration through the lens of religion. In doing so, it will explore the complex ways in which place, identity, and sociality intersect.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Qualitative, ethnographic research will be conducted among Kenyan Pentecostal migrants and Pentecostal churches in East London. It will primarily entail semi-structured, open-ended interviews with pastors and congregants and participant observation at churches and in the lives of congregants. Key areas of interest include the social networks of Kenyan Pentecostals, their place-making practices (ie, the ways in which they make themselves and their faith visible in the urban landscape), and churches as civic institutions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will contribute to debates at the interface of migration, faith, identity, and urbanism and expand the comparative base for understanding exclusionary religious projects. In addition to its contributions to scholarly research, it will also engage with policy concerns about migrants, especially religious ones, and interest in faith institutions as key players in civil society.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One potential impact of the research includes advancing understanding of whether or not Pentecostal churches can be considered civic institutions, in what ways, and how their institutional self-perception relates to policy discourses promoting faith institutions as vehicles for delivering services and generating social capital. This topic is currently of interest to the coalition government in terms of the 'Big Society' but is likely to remain on future government agendas. The impact will be maximized by working with local service providers, social policymakers, and other interested stakeholders, for instance, through their participation in the advisory group, a pre-study event, a post-study event, and/ or at a briefing on the role of churches in civil society. The stakeholders will be drawn primarily from the three boroughs where the churches are located and/ or among those working with Kenyans in East London. 

Another potential impact relates to the struggles for recognition of Kenyan Pentecostal pastors and congregants in their communities. Studies of faith-based institutions and the 'Big Society' (e.g. Kettell 2012) suggest that, though sceptical, many faith leaders see it as an opportunity to bring faith (back) into the public sector. Additionally, based on my previous research, Kenyan Pentecostals are aware of how migrants in general are perceived in policy and political discourse in Britain. Pastors will likely welcome opportunities created by this project both to articulate their ideas and visions for the future and to engage in discussions with policymakers and other local stakeholders. And, congregants will appreciate opportunities to contribute their perspectives and experiences to debates and policies. Participation in the advisory group, the study itself, and study events each represent such opportunities. Through their participation, pastors and congregants can contribute to the impact of this study on areas of concern to them. 

As part of the knowledge dissemination activities, I will circulate emerging findings in the form of briefing papers through a mailing list I will create, in addition to the extensive list COMPAS maintains. I will also develop a webpage on the COMPAS website (www.compas.ox.ac.uk) that provides an overview of the project and serves as another means of disseminating its findings and engaging with the academy and non-academic users. Additionally, I will write periodic blog posts to disseminate my findings and link my research with topical issues of the day. Together, these multifaceted communication efforts will ensure the impact of this project reaches a range of non-academic audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>151546</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Postgraduate course, Migration and Religion</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E94487CA-EF78-42DE-80AF-CA63D6DE416A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I designed and taught an option course entitled Migration and Religion for MSc in Migration Studies and MSc/MPhil in Social Anthropology students at Oxford University.

A key departure point for the workshop was what we see as a persistent tension/discrepancy: on the one hand, researchers have largely considered urban transformations, such as, suburbanisation and gentrification, as securalised phenomena and, on the other hand, the relationship between religion and space today is often seen as pertaining primarily to minorities and/or migrants. There remains a lack of sustained attention to the interplay between religion and spatial and social mobilities and their impact on urban transformations. Approximately 25 people attended, including academics and postgraduate students.

Black majority churches such as those I work with were under-represented in the report, the research for which tended to focus more on minority religions. While African migrants are ethnic minorities, their Christianity ostensibly places them at the centre of British religious life. Nonetheless, Pentecostal Christianity is far more socially conservative than mainstream Anglicanism and thus can in some respects be considered a minority religion. Given the growth in Black Majority Churches, especially Pentecostal ones, I argued that more research is needed to understand them in their own right, as well as in relation to the wider religious and non-religious landscape.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Co-convened workshop: Toward a dialogue between the Anthropology of Islam and of Christianity (UK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5E7F023-093D-46BF-9235-9BEF45411CF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I co-convened an international conference with two anthropology colleagues at Oxford to promote dialogue between anthropologists of Christianity and of Islam.

It is part of wider scholarly efforts to explore non-ethnic or -national forms of identification and pathways of incorporation into host societies. The key findings are organised into three thematic areas below. 

Ethno-religious encapsulation and cosmopolitanism
The study churches identify as multicultural and see their congregants as international. Members attempt to come together as 'brothers and sisters in Christ' irrespective of country or origin, ethnicity, or migrant status. Nonetheless, one nationality predominates in the congregations. This ethno-religious encapsulation sits awkwardly alongside their aspirations to create more genuinely multicultural congregations. However, inclusion and exclusion must be understood relational processes, generated by the perspectives, experiences, and practices of both church members and those who are not members. 

Religion, locality, and place-making
The study adopted a relational approach to exploring the convergence of religion, locality, and place-making in Kenyan migrants' religious identification as Pentecostals. It found that the social dynamics and structural contexts of the boroughs where the respective churches were located shaped efforts to create places of worship, as well as members' self-identification as born-again Christians. 

Pentecostal churches and their role in wider civil society
Most churches have not engaged in what is commonly thought of as civic or social engagement. However, their lack of engagement does not stem from disinterest or disinclination, but rather from a confluence of factors, ranging from to pragmatic constraints (e.g. space and limited financial resources) to theological concerns. With that said, numerous churches in the study engage in small-scale, one-off activities, such as, job-related educational trainings and health promotion seminars.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The following are three possible ways in which my findings could be taken forward. First, my finding of both ethno-religious encapsulation and cosmopolitanism among Kenyan Pentecostals suggests that being rooted in particular ethnic, cultural, religious, and/or national heritages can co-exist with being open to those who are different. This contributes to challenging a priori ideas of ethnic encapsulation as problematic, which can be found in policymaking, and can be taken forward by social science researchers to theorise further practices and experiences of cohabitation and co-existence in religiously pluralistic and socially diverse settings. It might also inform policymakers' thinking regarding programmes and policies to promote social cohesion. Second, my work on Pentecostal ideas of social engagement challenges an understanding of religion and politics as separate and distinct spheres. For those scholars interested in the role of religion in public life, my work has implications for our understanding of the relationship between religion and politics in secular-liberal societies, such as, the UK. Lastly, my research has helped to nuance and disaggregate studies of African-initiated Pentecostal churches in London, which have tended to focus on megachurches or extensive transnational religious networks of churches. This may encourage further comparative work, among both academics and third-sector practitioners and researchers, to understand such churches and the different trajectories of development they take as religious institutions and charitable organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C915C3E0-8934-4A7B-947B-1E0059818E34</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
