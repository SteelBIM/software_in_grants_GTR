The idea that the communities in informal settlements should be involved in improving their homes and neighbourhoods is often discussed in the international development community. However, the tools and processes needed to ensure a successful upgrade of environmental and construction management are poorly understood, and top-down policies used by central and local government in SA have not been successful to date. If communities can improve their neighbourhoods through participatory techniques, enhancing construction skills and using available materials, then there could be local, regional and national environmental, social and economic benefits. The research seeks to explore the underpinning barriers and enabling drivers for communities to upgrade their informal settlements in SA. 

The central question for this research is how can participatory approaches be utilised in an environmental and construction management strategy to achieve self-reliance in informal settlements in Durban. This question will be investigated under six discrete project phases.
Phase 1: Local Context and Gap Analysis (UKZN)
-Examining factors that have helped communities in Durban upgrade their housing and communities, and barriers to upgrading.
Phase 2: Mapping Urban Transitions through Community Participation (Westminster)
Through a participatory action-research methodology, the project team will produce findings on bottom-up construction and environmental management in Namibia Stop 8 (NS8) with the involvement of the community living there. NS8 is a good practice case study in Inanda, Durban. 
Phase 3: Integrated Closed-Loop Environmental Management Systems (UCL with UKZN)
- Exploring the potential of closed-loop systems where wastewater generated from NS8 can be reused for agriculture. 
- Investigating the processes, partnership models and business models required to ensure resilient infrastructure is provided.
Phase 4: Skills Enhancement in Construction (Westminster)
- Mapping the skills developed and enhanced through the 'self-build' approach adopted in NS8. 
- Transferring lessons from the UK Government Construction 2025 Strategy.
Phase 5: Developing and Testing an Integrated Collaborative Toolkit (Westminster and UKZN)
- Bringing together the key findings of individual Phases 1 to 4, this toolkit will take the form of a dynamic decision-making model, which will map potential ways for communities, businesses, and policymakers to collaborate. It will also identify the resources required, skills developed, and the business models created for mobilising private sector involvement and economic growth. 
Phase 6: Project Management, Communication and Dissemination (Westminster with UKZN)
- Allocating around 10% of the total cost of grant to communicate and disseminate findings to a varied audience. The dissemination strategy will include: project website, branding, social media, dissemination material, and dissemination events (UK and SA).

The research findings are intended to impact on SA government policy and practice in the field of sustainable urban transitions, building on best practice from the UK. However, this does not negate the potential to transfer knowledge from SA back to the UK or elsewhere. The intended target audience includes local communities seeking to enhance their quality of life and well-being and local authorities enhancing their planning. The research outputs can be also utilised by international agencies (eg UN), policy-makers and practitioners working on upgrading programmes, plans and policies, particularly under the SDG post-2015 development agenda.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Direct beneficiaries of the proposed research are South African (SA) local communities seeking to enhance their quality of life and local authorities enhancing their infrastructure and planning processes. The research outputs can be also utilised by international agencies (e.g. UN), policy-makers, implementers and practitioners working on upgrading programmes, plans and policies, particularly under the SDG post 2015 development agenda.

Impact on society and the environment: The proposed research has a significant societal impact by demonstrating how community-driven upgrading is a workable approach for integrated housing construction and environmental management services. Disseminating the project findings and applying the Collaborative Toolkit (Phase 5) in practice will impact on other informal settlements in Durban (e.g. Havelock project), SA and the wider Africa, thus building capacity for achieving self-reliance in resource-constraint contexts. During the project, local inhabitants will: a) become active co-investigators involved in the toolkit development and testing (Phase 5); b) be directly involved in community-level communication and dissemination activities (Phase 6); c) will have access to a workable toolkit. The Skills upgrade (Phase 4) will promote human capital and employability by improving technical, management and communication skills among community members, thus enhancing well-being. Associated sustainability benefits include environmental education and broader sustainability benefits (e.g. emissions reduction, re-use of water) related to resource efficiency in Phase 3.

Impact on economic growth: The toolkit (Phase 5) is a grassroots, frugal innovation that can be used to mobilise economic growth. If up-scaled and integrated into business models of organisations that have been / can be involved in the community upgrading process, this can have cumulative impacts to the socio-economic development of both Durban (regional) and SA (national). Direct beneficiaries include community organisations / enterprises (e.g. FEDUP) and the private sector, such as construction, wastewater or utility companies, particularly local SMEs. It will also have an impact on overcoming isolation in informal settlements and increasing possibilities for receiving support during institutional formalisation. 

Impact on international development: This project will enhance the capacity of community organisations and other support NGOs working in community-led upgrading, such as the Shack/Slum Dwellers International (SDI), Slum Networking, 100 Resilient Cities, and Cities Alliance. These organisations provide horizontal knowledge-transfer across affiliated country-based organisations located in Africa, Asia and Latin America. This offers opportunity for synergies amplifying the impact in the practice of these organisations and the communities they work with. Likewise, knowledge exchange will offer opportunities to disseminate the toolkit and discuss its relevance to different urban contexts across an extended network of affiliated organisations and the channels, within which the researchers and international co-investigator operate. 

Impact on policy: The findings will be of direct use to the eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality, which includes the city of Durban as well as the SA Department of Housing and the Department of Human Settlements. As these bodies have predominantly used a top-down approach, this research will provide a practical guide to work effectively with communities as partners and beneficiaries, thus integrating the Collaborative Toolkit into existing planning policies, building regulations and housing codes. 

To maximise the above direct impacts, around 10% of the total cost is allocated for a comprehensive dissemination strategy (Phase 6) including: project website; social media; dissemination material; and dissemination events in London and Durban (detailed in Pathways to impact).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>397467</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A short video was prepared by Phase 1 colleagues (led by SA PI Dr Claudia Loggia at the University of KwaZulu-Natal) which documents the experience during focus groups and household interviews in the fieldwork case studies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6AB19E37-7717-4772-9626-8AC7B115BF1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video was presented in the ISULabaNtu side event in Habitat III (17 October 2016) as a means to introduce the audience to the barriers and drivers for community-led upgrading in informal settlements in Durban (SA), from the perspectives of the local communities themselves.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Video featuring Phase 1 fieldwork activities</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The project team disseminates quarterly newsletters and has designed an ISULabaNtu logo used in all academic and non-academic communication and dissemination channels and activities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A409FF3A-7C8B-487F-8009-3FE715BB156F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A distinctive and clear logo, together with the quarterly newsletters have facilitated wider communication and dissemination of research activities as well as networking with other academic and non-academic (policy, industry) organisations in various settings (e.g. ESRC Urban Transformation Portfolio; Habitat III conference; ISOCARP 2016 conference; etc).</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Quarterly newsletters and logo</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.isulabantu.org/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Priti Parikh who is a Co-I in ISULabaNtu from UCL Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering was filmed at Engineering Showoff, part of the Science Showoff family of events.

Habitat III is the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, which takes place every twenty years. The objectives were to secure renewed political commitment for sustainable urban development, assess accomplishments from the last twenty years, address poverty and identify and address new and emerging challenges.
Dr Maria Christina Georgiadou (Project PI) presented an overview of the research programme, including a short video showing the Durban context and our fieldwork so far, followed by a panel discussion with five high profile experts working on informal settlements upgrading in South Africa: Beryl Mphakathi (Head of Human Settlements in eThekwini municipality, Durban), Prof Marie Huchzermeyer (University of the Witwatersrand), Emily Mohohlo (SDI), Dr Graham Alabaster (United Nations Human Settlements Programme, Urban Basic Services Branch), and Dr Zoleka Sokopo (South African National Department of Human Settlements). The discussion focused on critical questions affecting upgrading in informal settlement. It is essential to build trust with the communities, who should take ownership of the upgrading process. This should be reflected in the skills and capabilities that communities and local authorities need to develop further for effective community-led upgrading, including: 1) the development of effective interim tenure forms to enhance the occupational rights of local communities, 2) local administration and central accounting that incorporate community self-regulation and microfinancing schemes.
The project team were delighted with the attendance and discussion at the event, an important element of the work as an applied research project focusing on accurate and on-the-ground research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.isulabantu.org/single-post/2016/10/19/Habitat-III-side-event-reaction</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>30000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Citizen-led Smart City Development in UK and Kazakhstan</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>British Council</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>30003FEC-644B-4EC3-B300-63DB211CE4F7</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our preliminary findings have contributed to the following non-academic impacts:
1) Enhancing skills of local populations through community training and community dissemination events: 
In this research, community members are not just objects of study but grassroots co-researchers or co-investigators involved in the data collection (fieldwork activities). In addition, community events have been organised in Phase 1 and Phase 2 for community participants and the wider community (case study area). This has created a collaborative learning environment, where scientific knowledge is blended with the indigenous knowledge from grassroots co-researchers. Topics include: neighbourhood planning; housing; and the impact of community self-reliance on policy and planning. 
2) Establishing close working relationships with community organisations: 
In the proposed participatory, action-based research, a good working relationship is required with individuals at all levels of the community; from powerful incumbents to the residents in the most difficult socio-economic circumstances. In order to ensure these relationships are in place, the project team has worked successfully with a credible, local NGO (uTshani Fund, project partner under NRF) with good links in Namibia Stop 8 (NS8), Piesang River and Havelock (3 selected case studies). Through uTshani Fund the project team has also been connected with the Community Organisation Resource Centre (CORC) and Federation of the Urban and Rural Poor&amp;nbsp;(FEDUP), which are in the Shack/ Slum Dwellers International (SDI)&amp;nbsp;international network. This close relationship from the outset of the project has established a solid foundation for the development and testing of the collaborative toolkit. 
3) Engaging with policymakers and practitioners in SA to ensure relevance of outputs: 
More broadly, the project team has met formally and engaged with policymakers and practitioners in Durban and SA working in bottom-up upgrading of informal settlements. These include: eThekwini municipality (Human Settlements Unit and Water and Sanitation Unit); National Treasury (Cities Support Programme); and the SA Department of Human Settlements. The findings seek to demonstrate the effectiveness of community-led, bottom-up upgrading of informal settlements to local and central government policymakers, and will detail how to work effectively with communities as partners and beneficiaries. The project team will continue to further engage with these stakeholders throughout the project lifecycle, from fieldwork activities through to the validation and dissemination of the final project outputs.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F59D53E1-837C-4D8B-B160-BE2E03E95B37</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Informal settlements are complex and diverse entities with their own unique issues and set of characteristics. Theoretically, this paper has revealed that the challenge of informal settlement upgrading in South Africa should not be conceived simply as a housing problem but rather as a community-led, participatory process of social change, seeking to realise multi-sector partnerships, long-term commitment, and political support to gain formalisation. This process should take place from the early planning of the upgrade, as the early project phases are the most crucial for community participation. Active community participation is also endorsed by the New Urban Agenda under Habitat III, which calls for not just partnerships but inclusive participatory models through community empowerment and planning activism. 
At a practical level, however, the study argues that there is a gap in effective community-led participatory upgrading projects in South Africa. There is also little understanding of the unique, context-specific factors that underpin the establishment of an informal settlement. Currently these local particularities are lost in the 'one-size-fits-all' government-led upgrading models adopted by the South African municipalities, thus leading to delays in: planning; service delivery and supply change; installation of services; and tendering with building contractors. Future research should explore the co-production of local knowledge with the local communities, support organisations and policymakers to inform the development or refinement of government-led upgrading models adopted by the South African municipalities and national departments. 

Preliminary findings from Phase 1:
Participation should not refer to a voluntary contribution to government programmes but rather to active involvement in shaping the upgrading process throughout the project lifecycle. Communities have the local knowledge and experience of what works and why in their own settlements. Empowering local people in participatory bottom-up models offers:
? community leadership and independence;
? commitment in the upgrading process due to ownership and sense of belonging;
? skills upgrade through training; and
? leveraging additional subsidies and resources available from the municipalities. 
Phase 1 preliminary fieldwork activities demonstrated that the concept of 'community' is interpreted as a place where &amp;quot;people come to live together, work together, settle in&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;people live with similar needs and views; &amp;quot;people coming together as &amp;quot;one&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;a place where people coexist together with one goal&amp;quot;. The interpretation of &amp;quot;successful upgrading&amp;quot; varies significantly between the community (improvement of living conditions), NGOs (community mobilisation and group savings); and the municipality (provision of services).
The main barriers and challenges to community-led upgrading involve: 
? lack of trustful relationship with Municipality; 
? unresolved land tenure (households waiting for title deeds) after the upgrade;
? technological issues with plumbing systems, sanitation, wastewater management;
? stealing materials and utilities; 
? dependence on the Municipality also for the provision of services; and
? conflicts/tensions within the communities; 
The key drivers for participatory, community-led upgrading involve: 
? negotiations with the Municipality
? community organisation and social cohesion; 
? developing a culture of group savings; 
? creation of job opportunities; 
? skills enhancement (e.g. technical, management, and soft skills, such as communication, negotiation, leadership); and 
? skills transfer through a collaborative learning environment (e.g. communities of practice). 
Previous studies on in-situ upgrading of informal settlements in Durban metropolitan area have explored the positive impact of community participation on local inhabitants in terms of having basic housing needs met, tenure security and wellbeing improvement (Patel, 2013). However, it is important to distinguish between aspects of participation and active community empowerment through planning activism, as shown in Namibia Stop 8. From the review of the background literature the following recommendations can be drawn:
? There is no 'one-size-fits-all' model in informal settlements upgrading. Policy makers and practitioners need to understand the local context and uncover the barriers and drivers for inclusive community-led upgrading from an early planning stage. It is essential to understand the historical development and the dynamics of the informal settlement in order to adapt or refine the upgrading model according to complexities, strengths and weaknesses of individual cases.
? Future policy-making in the field should go beyond provision of information and basic consultation activities with the community. There is a need for policy instruments and upgrading models that build on community leadership and planning activism, facilitating co-production of knowledge with the local population, whilst simultaneously leading to empowered communities and participatory models of urbanisation. Scholars argue the co-production can provide critical understanding of community-led processes and how these can be integrated into institutional formalisation, government policy, technological and managerial innovations that can enhance self-reliance, skills and quality of life (Boyle and Harris, 2009; Petcou and Petrescu, 2015). 
? The role of the support organisation and the researcher in community-led upgrading projects is to first help local people visualise and understand the change that will effectively take place in their own environment; and, second, to provide space for community members to negotiate and therefore take informed decisions resolving issues and potential conflicts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings of ISULabaNtu will be taken forward in Phase 5, which will run throughout Year 3 of research (Feb 2018/ Feb 2019). Phase 5 will develop and test a novel Collaborative Toolkit bringing together the key findings of individual Phases 1 to 4 (Phase 1: Local Context and Gap Analysis; Phase 2: Mapping Urban Transitions through Community Participation; Phase 3: Integrated Closed-Loop Environmental Management Systems; Phase 4: Project Management and Skills Enhancement in Construction).
This toolkit will take the form of a dynamic decision-making model, which will map potential pathways of collaboration, thus reconciling:
? the key roles of involved stakeholders (e.g. local populations; community organisations, such as FEDUP and uTshani Fund; local authorities; the private sector; government; and international agencies); 
? the resources required and skills developed during these collaborative interactions; and
? the business models created for achieving integrated environmental and construction management, thus mobilising the economic viability of community organisations and private sector involvement. 
This validation process will offer opportunities for refining the toolkit itself (internal validity), if necessary, but also to account for different local contexts (external validity and reliability) when transferring findings to South Africa (going beyond Durban to Johannesburg or Cape Town) and wider Africa. Lastly, the UK co-investigator in business and civil society (Eco Ltd Solutions) and the international co-investigator will support the validation of the Collaborative Toolkit providing advisory services. They will also facilitate the mobilisation of international feedback on its applicability outside SA through their extensive expertise in urban planning, sustainable development, and community-based projects delivered for international bodies, such as UNDP, UNIDP, African Development Bank, World Bank and European Commission.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>36AE49FE-2393-4066-9B74-32FF8856AC22</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.isulabantu.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training to SA PI's (Dr Claudia Loggia) research group at the School of Built Environment and Development Studies, University of KwaZulu-Natal</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3DAB2860-4132-4485-92C0-866B9ECAE20A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK PI (Dr Maria Christina Georgiadou) with UK Co-Is (Dr Isis Nunez Fererra and Ben Fagan-Watson) have provided training for Dr Claudia Loggia (SA PI under NRF) and her research group involved in ISULabaNtu (group of academics, researchers, post-graduate and doctoral students) in the areas of:

Tierra Baja is only the 3rd Afro-Colombian informal settlement granted Collective Land Title in the Caribbean region of Colombia. As a result of the collective land tenure being achieved, the community will be entitled to infrastructure and service improvements by the District Municipality that were not possible before due to its informal, not-recognised condition, and will have access to dedicated funding channels for productive activities through the INCODER (Colombian Institute of Rural Development).</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The SA PI (Dr Claudia Loggia, Senior Lecturer at the University of KwaZulu-Natal) has recently become a member of 100 Resilient Cities (RC) reference group (Durban) because of her involvement in the ISULabaNtu project.

This methodology focuses on:
1) GROUPS AND PROCESSES [savings, construction, project cycle]. This included interviews and focus groups with community groups and civil society organisations involved in the upgrading of the three selected case studies. Specific data collection tools utilised include: in-depth interviews / mapping the project-cycle; focus groups with Community Based Organisations (CBOs) and other organised groups; community interactive events: priority exercises, visual tools, city mapping.
2) HOUSEHOLD UPGRADING: These activities were undertaken with homeowners, using a variety of methods to facilitate a better articulation of their positive and negative experiences, particularly with regards to the quality of construction, spatial arrangements and affordability. These methods included in-depth interviews and recording of their everyday activities within the house through personal timelines. Particular data collection tools included: personal housing narratives and historical timelines using in-depth interviews and focus groups; mapping of use and post-occupancy transformation of the house; photo voice in conjunction with in-depth interviews or focus groups.
3) NEIGHBOURHOOD and CITY ISSUES: These activities engaged residents in a critical discussion of their neighbourhood upgrading and current situation, including the existence and/or condition of infrastructure, public spaces, street and corridors and the surroundings. Residents were also involved in discussions about their settlement and everyday life in relation to the city of Durban. Specific data collection tools utilised include: participatory / mind mapping exercises; photo-voice exercises; mapping city trajectories; community interactive events: priority exercises, visual tools, city mapping.</gtr:description><gtr:id>04A3ACC3-9C45-4DCD-B8E7-E2AF6209DA69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This dataset will provide the basis for data analysis in individual Phases 1 to 4. Most importantly, it provides key guidance for the co-production strategy, which will be implemented in Phases 3, 4 and 5. In Phase 5 (Year 3) of the research, the project team seeks to develop and test a novel Collaborative Toolkit bringing together the key findings of individual Phases 1 to 4. This toolkit will take the form of a dynamic decision-making model, which will map potential pathways of collaboration, thus reconciling:
? the key roles of involved stakeholders (e.g. local populations; community organisations, such as FEDUP and uTshani Fund; local authorities; the private sector; government; and international agencies (predominantly Phase1 and 2)); 
? the resources required (procurement) and skills developed (through project management) during these collaborative interactions (Phase 4); and
? the business models created for achieving integrated environmental (Phase 3) and construction management (Phase 4), thus mobilising the economic viability of community organisations and private sector involvement. This validation process will offer opportunities for refining the toolkit itself (internal validity), if necessary, but also to account for different local contexts (external validity and reliability) when transferring findings to South Africa (Johannesburg and Cape Town) and the wider Africa.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Participatory action research design for coproducing knowledge with local communities (3 informal settlements as fieldwork case studies in Durban metropolitan area)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>HEDON Household Energy Network</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>HEDON Household Energy Network is an exempt charity and a company limited by guarantee, incorporated in England under number 7477778.
