This lacuna is due in part to the fact that the use of French by the Russian nobility, as an aspect of elite culture, was of less interest to Soviet scholars working within a Marxist framework than phenomena that tended to break down that culture. Moreover, revelation of a strong foreign influence on Russian life and culture could be adversely perceived in a patriotic tradition of scholarship as capable of diverting attention from native Russian virtues.\n\nAims and Objectives\nThe project will focus on the period from c. 1750, when French was beginning to be used at court and among the Russian nobility, to c. 1850, by which time its use was becoming more restricted and the social and cultural contexts that had originally favoured it were much changed. Working with a team of two post-doctoral research assistants and a postgraduate, I shall aim to discover who in pre-revolutionary Russia spoke or wrote what varieties of French in what domains and for what purposes. At the same time we shall explore the effects that the use of French had on Russian linguistic usage and on Russian society, culture, politics and thought during the period when a rich secular literature was being created and an emergent intelligentsia was constructing an identity for the nation.\n\nMethodology\nThe team will use approaches and insights drawn from various disciplines in which scholars share an interest in language. We shall draw upon sociolinguists' work on varieties of language, prestige languages, standardisation, purism and bilingualism, and upon the work of sociologists and cultural theorists on power, gender and class, as well as historians' work on national identity and nationalism. In order to ensure that findings across this wide disciplinary range are of uniformly high academic quality, I shall recruit research assistants from different backgrounds (sociolinguistics in one case and social sciences in the other) who will complement my own expertise in intellectual and cultural history and philology. The team will work closely with an international Advisory Board of distinguished scholars (five from UK universities and one each from Belgium, Russia and Switzerland) who have expertise in diverse fields.\n\nOutcomes and Potential Benefits\nBy means of a two-volume monograph, a website, three international events (a seminar series, a conference and a colloquium), proceedings arising from these events and a PhD thesis, the project will:\n\n* deepen understanding of the process by which, and the degree to which, Russia was integrated into the mainstream of modern European civilisation during the age when nations were being formed;\n* contribute to understanding of the development of national self-consciousness and forms of nationalism;\n* illustrate the linguistic, social, cultural, political and intellectual effects of major language contact, identifying both the benefits that bilingualism may bring to a community and the anxieties and tensions it may cause; \n* contribute to the emergent field of historical scholarship on language; \n* promote interdisciplinary dialogue, throwing light on the extent to which theories, models and methods can prove valid and useful across disciplinary boundaries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact summary\nI expect the main impact of this project to be felt in the academic community and in another section of my application have described the types of impact that I foresee there and the ways in which I aim to achieve it. The multidisciplinary and international character of the project should ensure that its impact in the academic community is wide.\n\nLike much other research in the humanities, the project should also bring cultural benefit to society in a way that is not precisely definable, by deepening understanding of the human past. Its main output, the monograph on the history of the French language in Russia, will be written in a way that will make it accessible to a public outside academia and it should attract educated readers with an interest in European languages, societies and cultures.\n\nThere are also two more specific respects in which the project will have significance for an international audience beyond the academic community.\n\nFirst, the question of the relationship between Russia and the West, which has been of fundamental importance in Russian thought and culture since the late eighteenth century and which is central to my project, remains intensely topical. Russia continues in the post-Soviet period to reassess this relationship and to harbour ambivalent feelings about further integration in European civilisation. The country is therefore in danger of marginalisation as the expanding European Union (EU) strengthens the cohesion of Europe beyond Russia's western border, sometimes perpetuating stereotypical views of Russia in the process. In this contemporary context my historical study of linguistic and intercultural relations between Europe's East and West will have potential relevance to a wide educated public, the media and organisations in the EU and Russia that are concerned with cultural diplomacy. The major event associated with the project, an international conference in 2012, which is the bicentenary of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, offers a particularly favourable and timely opportunity to underscore this relevance, and the presence of scholars based in three francophone countries and in Russia as well as the UK will enable the research team to take full advantage of it.\n\nSecondly, linguistic subjects that lie at the heart of the project, especially language spread and multilingualism, also have topical resonance. Some of the reactions to the spread of French in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, for example, foreshadow contemporary anxieties about the effect of the global ascendancy of English on other languages and cultures. Again, as at various times in pre-revolutionary Russia, so in the twenty-first-century world multilingualism may be perceived either in a negative or a positive light. It may seem, for instance, to threaten a community's identity, in which case it may help to awaken nationalistic resistance to foreign phenomena. Conversely, it may be celebrated - as it currently is in the EU - as a means of increasing solidarity, combating virulent nationalism and accelerating the creation of wealth in the competitive global marketplace. My project therefore has the potential to find a place in contemporary public debate about the implications of language spread and multilingualism, which may touch upon such highly practical matters as 'social inclusion and exclusion, identity, political participation, cultural diversity and cross-cultural understanding' (the words are taken from the European Commission's 'New Framework Strategy for Multilingualism' published in 2005).\n\nIn the accompanying Impact Plan I describe in more detail how I propose to engage with communities and organisations beyond academia and to draw out such topical implications of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>687616</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Francophonie in Russia'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2899F667-5AC3-4B4B-AB57-90B2A050480C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lecture given at the Cercle fran?ais de Bristol.

Language (the varieties that are used, their functions, the domains in which they are used, their distribution among social classes and between genders, attitudes towards them and so forth) has more importance for the study of social, political, cultural and intellectual history than the relative paucity of scholarship on it in these fields would seem to suggest. Building on some pioneering work by such scholars as Robert Evans (who is a member of our project's Advisory Board) and Peter Burke (who in September 2012 delivered the keynote lecture at our international conference in the University of Bristol on 'The French Language in Russia'), we are showing through our multidisciplinary history of French in Russia that language use there was inextricably bound up with social, political and cultural practices, ideas, values and movements.

? The conventional assumption that the pre-revolutionary Russian noble class habitually spoke French, which is to be found in much scholarship about Russia and about bilingualism in general, is simplistic. Research already undertaken by the team, including study of a large number of primary sources in Russian archives (GARF, RGADA, RGIA, RGVIA, Tver regional archive) and libraries in Russia and elsewhere (RGB in Moscow, RNB in St Petersburg, the Biblioth&amp;egrave;que nationale in Paris), suggests that patterns of linguistic usage in pre-revolutionary Russia were in fact complex, varying not only from class to class and setting to setting but also from one social group to another within the same class, from family to family, from one family member to another or even - in the case of individual speakers - from communication with one interlocutor to communication with another, and - very importantly - from one historical period to another. We are therefore composing a far more complex and nuanced account of the phenomenon of francophonie in Russia than we believe has been provided before.

? Besides examining actual linguistic usage among various social groups at different times and in particular written genres and linguistic domains, we are also making a close study of attitudes towards language use and of debate about language and its supposed and/or desired characteristics and functions. We emphasise that, for many reasons, perceptions of the nature of a language and the implications of choosing a particular language when more than one language is available change over time. Attitudes towards the use of French among a social elite of cosmopolitan outlook in late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Russia, for example, were not necessarily the same as those adopted by members of the mid-nineteenth-century intelligentsia, who had been subjected during the Romantic period to a cultural nationalism which closely linked language with nationality, ethnicity and popular culture. We must therefore be aware of the social, cultural and intellectual background against which observations about language and its use are made. We must also beware of taking imaginative literature and tendentious thought as reliable accounts of social and sociolinguistic practice.

? The interplay of French and Russian in Russia from the mid-eighteenth century to around the mid-nineteenth is being explored in a pair of volumes of c. 100,000 words each under the overarching title 'French and Russian in Russia: From the Enlightenment to the Age of Pushkin'. Volume 1 is sub-titled 'The Use of French among the Eighteenth- and Nineteenth-Century Russian Elite' and Volume 2 is sub-titled 'Language Attitudes and the Formation of Social, Political and National Identity'. These volumes are under contract with Edinburgh University Press for inclusion in their series on Russian Language and Society and are due to be published in June 2015. They have been co-edited by Derek Offord (the Principal Investigator on the project team) and Gesine Argent (a postdoctoral research fellow), together with Vladislav Rjeoutski (formerly also a post-doctoral research fellow in the project team; now a researcher in the German Historical Institute in Moscow) and Lara Ryazanova-Clarke of the University of Edinburgh. Each volume contains fourteen chapters by an international team of contributors (based mainly in Russia, France and the US, as well as the UK). Eleven out of the 28 chapters have been authored or co-authored by Offord, Argent and Rjeoutski. As their sub-titles suggest, the volumes will focus on language use and on perceptions of the effects of language use respectively.

? Our findings challenge notions and attitudes to which many nineteenth-century Russian writers gave currency and which have remained influential in studies of Russian history and culture. One such notion is that bilingualism and biculturalism were destructive both to the Russian social fabric and to the personal well-being of the francophone nobility. They were not only symptomatic of social division, it has been argued, but also indicative and even to some extent a cause of the dissociation of the elite from their native soil. We follow Michelle Marrese, who has done ground-breaking work on this subject, in questioning this assumption about the tendency of bilingualism to divide and estrange what had supposedly been an organic community before the westernisation of Russia. 

? We also emphasise that knowledge of French in Russia had types of impact which might widely be regarded as positive, although they have not been presented in that light, if any attention has been paid to them at all. French was a lingua franca that made possible communication with foreigners, the language of a civilising court, the language by which Russia presented itself to Europe and the vehicle for the introduction of Enlightenment ideas. It was the language of a new polite society, in which women for the first time played a prominent social role in Russia. It was a preferred medium for certain types of amateur literary production that flourished in aristocratic society, before the professionalisation of literary activity. It was a source of self-respect and an international sign of status among the noble estate through which western innovation chiefly flowed into Russia. French served too, of course, as a linguistic model for the development of the Russian literary language. Even as a phenomenon which the emergent literary community and intelligentsia resolved to resist it was productive: as consciousness of nationhood grew in the Romantic period after the Napoleonic Wars, the pervasive presence of French stimulated native cultural creativity. From the point of view of social, political and cultural history, then, the development in the course of the eighteenth century of a community of Russian men and women who had an active written and oral command of French, or at least a good reading knowledge of it, was a key factor in the westernisation and modernisation of Russia. 

? In exploring the function of French as a means of transmitting European culture to Russia and bringing Russia into European civilisation we pay particular attention to education, as a means both of developing language skills and of inculcating knowledge and values, and to lexicography and translation, as means both of transmitting new concepts and of developing and enriching the vernacular. Our preliminary findings on language acquisition in eighteenth-century Russian education are now published in a cluster of four articles edited by the research team. Two of these articles were authored by one of the team's members, Rjeoutski. This cluster, together with the team's foreword, is available in the inaugural number of an online journal, Vivliofika: E-Journal of Eighteenth-Century Russian Studies (URL: http://vivliofika.library.duke.edu/). 

? Besides presenting the case for a more positive view of the impact of Franco-Russian bilingualism in Russia than has previously been fashionable, we also question whether Russia is such an exceptional historical and cultural case as it has often been assumed to be. The notion of Russian exceptionalism, which is closely bound up with unease about westernisation and the attendant cultural nationalism of the nineteenth-century literary community, has been pronounced in Russian culture itself (especially in classical Russian literature) and also in a twentieth-century tradition of scholarship about Russian culture (in particular, the tradition associated with Yuri Lotman). It was partly in order to engage with this notion that we organised, during the calendar year 2012, a seminar series devoted to the history of the use of French in other European countries. By this means, we have attempted to place the history of Russian francophonie in a broad European context, revealing the existence, mutatis mutandis, of similar linguistic influences, social and cultural phenomena and anxious debate in many European countries from the late seventeenth to the early twentieth centuries. Our findings on the pan-European background to our study of language use in pre-revolutionary Russia have been published in a book of c. 160,000 words, European Francophonie: The Social, Political and Cultural History of an International Prestige Language (Peter Lang, 2014), the first volume in a new series on Historical Sociolinguistics. This book contains fourteen chapters and a conclusion, including chapters on medieval England, Piedmont, Italy more generally, the Netherlands, Prussia, Bohemia, Spain, Sweden, Poland, the Romanian Lands and Turkey, as well as Russia.

? The Russian exceptionalist argument was often supported by a claim that the Russian people were peculiarly receptive to other cultures and that they therefore possessed a universal breadth of vision and understanding. (Tolstoy and Dostoevsky are proponents of this point of view, which found expression, for example, in 'War and Peace' by the former and the famous Pushkin speech delivered by the latter in 1880.) The claim is strikingly similar to that which was made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries for the French language - namely that its naturalness and clarity endowed French with 'universalit&amp;eacute;' and that this language (together with the culture for which it was a vehicle) was bound, indeed entitled, to spread. The research team will therefore want during the final phase of the project to investigate the possibility that the Russian discourse on universalism owes something to long and close familiarity with the French language and the discourse about its qualities.

? In examining the history of French in pre-revolutionary Russia, we do not lose sight of the fact that French was only one of the foreign languages used there; English, Latin and particularly German also had important roles at certain times. By building a complex picture not merely of the use of French across a wide chronological span and social range but also of the larger pattern of foreign-language use in pre-revolutionary Russia, we are able to identify differences in the functions of these various foreign languages on Russian soil and to define the social and cultural functions of a prestige language (in this instance French), which may serve, but does not always necessarily serve, as a lingua franca.

? On a broader plane, we believe that our work, as an extremely far-reaching study of the history of a foreign language in a major European nation, will provide insights of general use in fields of sociolinguistic interest such as bilingualism and multilingualism, language choice and code-switching, gender and language use, lexical borrowing, standardisation, linguistic purism and language attitudes, as they are reflected in metalinguistic discourse (talk about language).
