nutrient content.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/H004645/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Understanding the processes which promote satiety and so decrease the risk of overeating and a consequent positive energy balance are critical to our future ability to counteract the worldwide rise in the incidence of obesity. The traditional view of satiety is that suppression of appetite after eating arises from physiological effects of the ingested nutrients. However, while it is clear that nutrients do generate satiety signals, there are many aspects of satiety that cannot be explained simply as an effect of nutrient ingestion. For example, nutrients ingested as beverages generate weak satiety, whereas nutrients in a different liquid context (soup) generate strong satiety. This implies that something about the context in which nutrients are consumed is critical to the subsequent experience of fullness. Taking a more cognitive view, this research considers the extent to which consumer expectations about how filling a food will be may modify satiety. Thus a beverage may be consumed on the expectation of reduced thirst but not satiety, thereby leading to a failure to attribute physiological satiety cues generated by the drink nutrients to the actual drink product. Conversely, if the expectation is that a food will lead to strong feelings of fullness, this may lead to greater suppression of appetite than that generated by the same nutrients in the absence of expectations. Preliminary data in our laboratory are consistent with this view: protein was more effective in suppressing appetite when consumed in a context which was consistent with satiety than on its own. This research builds on this finding in a 3-phase programme designed to test the principle that expectations interact with physiological cues to modify satiety and so direct consumer behaviour. To achieve this, in Phase 1 we explore for the first time how expectations generated by label information and sensory quality modify the satiating effects of protein both in a snack and breakfast context. These experiments will first identify effective expectation manipulations and then examine their impact on satiety both when a product is first encountered and after repeat consumption. To ensure the outcome is both consistent and relevant to real-life behaviour, separate studies will use more controlled laboratory tests of eating and more naturalistic studies in a quasi-restaurant setting. The outcome of this 2-year Phase will be a clear test of the concept that expectations may interact with post-ingestive cues to generate satiety. How these expectations may modify actual physiological satiety responses will be tested in Phase 2, which examines how expectation-nutrient interactions modify the release of satiety hormones. As with Phase 1, these effects will be tested both acutely, and as a function of learning about the product as a consequence of repeated consumption. Finally, Phase 3 explores the utility of these findings for food product development by examining the effects of extended home consumption of products designed to generate maximum satiety through combinations of expectation and nutrient content. Separate home consumer trials will be run with the snack and breakfast products developed in Phase 1 and 2, and outcome measures will include effects of consuming high-satiety products on overall energy intake, and consumer evaluations of the products in terms of acceptability and future purchase intentions. The overall outcome of the programme will be both a detailed evaluation of the interaction between consumer expectations and physiological controls of satiety for the first time, and the use of such interactions to formulate new design rules for the development of future food products that generate consumer-perceivable satiety benefits.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Satiety involves integration of cognitive, oral, &amp;amp; post-ingestive signals. However, aspects of satiety remain puzzling, including the ineffectiveness of beverages to generate satiety. One possibility is that expectations about likely effects of consumed items on satiety interact with actual nutrient effects. If so, increasing expectations that products will be satiating should magnify effects of ingested nutrients, improving appetite regulation, and this is explored here. In Phase 1 optimal manipulations of satiety expectations, sensory quality &amp;amp; levels of nutrient that generate satiety, will be established, and how combinations of satiety expectations (through product labelling and sensory quality) &amp;amp; nutrient content interact will be explored. Studies concentrate on protein-based satiety only since this appears more effective than other macronutrients in generating satiety. Phase 1 will use both a mid-morning drink-preload manipulation, and a modified breakfast in a naturalistic environment, to determine the extent to which expectations modify satiety both acutely (Experiments 1-4), and as a consequence of repeat consumption (to test for learning: Experiment 5). How expectation effects relate to release of satiety hormones is tested in Phase 2, with Experiment 6 examining acute effects of manipulated expectation and Experiment 7 exploring effects of learning. Phase 3 explores longer term effects of repeated consumption of products optimised to generate satiety, with 2-week interventions where either an optimised satiety product or control consumed at home either as a mid-morning snack (Study 1) or breakfast (Study 2). Outcome measures include daily energy intake, appetite post-consumption and consumer evaluations of the products. Overall, the project outcome could explain discrepancies in the literature on the nature of satiety and offer the food industry new design rules for development of food products with consumer perceivable benefits on appetite control.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? The major beneficiary will be those sectors of the food industry who are engaged in marketing and production of new food products where satiety is an issue and broader sectors of the food and catering industries who are responding to increased legislation on food labeling. The potential for the design rules for enhancing satiety to impact on weight control also has relevance for health professionals interested in weight control, and the general public. How will they benefit? The outcome of this proposal will be guidance on how the way a product is described, the immediate sensory quality the consumer experiences and post-ingestive nutrient effects interact to generate satiety. This may lead to new design rules for optimising the impact of foods on consumer experience of satiety, and this will be the primary benefit to the food industry. The theoretical and empirical knowledge gained from this research will enhance our understanding of the nature of satiety, with the potential to cause a paradigm shift away from the predominant nutritional/physiological interpretation of satiety to one taking a more cognitive view point. Understanding how consumers experience satiety will have benefits for health professionals designing weight control programmes, while the increased understanding of how labeling may modify satiety expectations will help sectors of the food and catering industries who will be introducing more detailed food labeling in response to legislative requirements in response to the current obesity crisis. What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research? Those sectors of the food industry who are part of DRINC will be made aware of the programme through the bi-annual DRINC meetings, and through direct engagement with key scientists in those companies who have shown particular interest in this research. We have also targeted the international Sensory Science Pangborn conference as a forum where we can present this work in an industry-focused environment. In addition, we plan to publish reviews of this work in trade journals which are widely read by the food and catering industries. The empirical research will also be presented at leading international conferences and in high quality academic journals to ensure this work is accessible to academic users, and inclusion of one obesity-related conference later in the programme will bring the work to the attention of health professionals with interests in weight control. The PI (Yeomans) has a track record both of high rates of publication and impact of his research, and a history of engagement with industry, both of which will enhance his ability to ensure impact. The knowledge and contacts of Co-applicant 1 (Rodgers) with the catering industry will allow us unique links through which to both bring the outcome of this work to that industry but also to explore future collaborations aimed at maximising the benefit of this work in that context. In terms of exploitation of the outcome, it may be possible to license the design rules generated by this work, and the PI will explore this possibility with colleagues in the University of Sussex Enterprise team.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>539704</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leatherhead Food Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Nutrition</gtr:department><gtr:description>Hormone testing, Leatherhead</gtr:description><gtr:id>2839C336-F3C5-4242-95F2-CB33CF595810</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper submitted but not yet accepted</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They ran one study for us, providing expertise in gut hormone analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We helped Leatherhead modify the standard design they use for satiety studies, hosted 6 visits by LFR staff and contributed to their Forum day programmes</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Aarhus University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Denmark, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sensewell</gtr:description><gtr:id>B543CCB1-4AD4-4CFE-849F-4DF240302846</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk and workshop at Eurosense 2014</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners are conducting the studies incorporating my advice</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Two visits to Copenhagen to act ad external advisor on Sensewell programme: contributed to research design and commented on progress and outputs</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leatherhead Food Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Nutrition</gtr:department><gtr:description>CASE award, Leatherhead</gtr:description><gtr:id>47BFCA5A-FE00-4952-95A5-198A44771AB7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multiple presentations both to industry and academic audiences by the student, two refereed published papers and a PhD thesis</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Leatherhead (LFR) have hosted the student on many occasions: he has been provided with in house LFR training, has given two talks to LFR and conducted one very major study at LFR.

The main research programme consisted of six laboratry-based human experimental studies examining satiety after ingestion of specially formulated products (mainly beverages) and two more extended, applied trials testing the real-world application of the core findings. Supplementary work by the associated PhD students allowed a further 6 experiments to be conducted. The key outcomes can be summarised as:
1) People feel fuller, and consume less food at a test meal, after they have consumed a higher energy product if that product has sensory characteristics which predict the presence of energy. This effect was replicated in six experimental studies and the two consumer trials. 
2) Persuading consumers to think of a drink as a snack without altering the sensory characteristics of the drink also increased the amount of satiety they experienced after consuming the drinks, suggesting significant top-down control on the way nutrients are processed.
4) Providing people with low energy products that they believe to be higher energy because of their sensory characteristics (for example a think and creamy low-energy drink) fails to generate satiety, but instead can result in rebound hunger. This mismatch of beliefs and actual nutrients lead to increased intake in some cases, raising concerns for the appropriate design of reduced energy products in general.
5) The enhanced satiety generated by manipulating the sensory characteristics of a test beverage product were still evident after the same product had been consumed multiple times, indicating that the enhanced satiety was long-lasting
6) The enhanced satiety generated by manipulating the sensory characteristics of a test beverage product were at least partly attributable to changes in gut hormone response to ingestion. In particular, levels of the gut hormone pancreatic polypeptide were enhanced by the experience of a thick, creamy product in the mouth regardless of actual nutrient content. In contrast, levels of a second hormone (cholecystokinin) depended on both the sensory characteristics and nutrient content of the product.
7) The basic findings on enhancement of satiety were translated into real-life benefits in consumer tests. Consumers who experienced a novel product optimized for satiety noticed feeling fuller and snacking less than when they consumed the same energy without the expectation manipulations. Likewise, a fruit smoothie optimized for satiety was as effective as a fruit salad in suppressing appetite, but had the added advantage of increasing overall fruit consumption. These applied findings bide well for the effective exploitation of the study outcomes.
Overall the project has characterized satiety as a complex interaction between psychology and physiology and paves the way for more applied studies to look at the use of these outcomes in reversing the positive energy balance associated with obesity.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The primary beneficiary will be the food and beverage industries, as the design rules formulated from the outcome of the primary research can be used to inform product design to generate new products optimised to generate satiety for consumers. The key steps to ensure this impact is realised include further engagement with key industry partners, formal publication of the design rules in industry-facing publications and partnerships with industry converting the rules into tangible products. The knowledge that satiety can be manipulated by beliefs, and in particular the finding that diet products may lead to rebound hunger and overeating, has policy implications for treatment of obesity and warrant further study and consideration by policy makers on nutrition. The findings also have implications for groups involved in education on nutrition.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F81FECA2-4026-4932-A945-5C54E3F00FFA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture,
