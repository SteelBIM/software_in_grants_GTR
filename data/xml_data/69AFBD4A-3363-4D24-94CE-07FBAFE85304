We are short, however, of rigorous, evidence-driven analysis. This timely project seeks to combine the data resources of the Local Data Company with the 25 years' experience combined with academic rigour in this field, which characterises the work of the Oxford Institute of Retail Management, based at the University of Oxford's Said Business School, to produce a 'State of UK Retail Places' report.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>LDC surveys each retail premise every 26 weeks, tracking who is opening and who is closing; the history of each premise; and exactly where the 45,000 vacant retail units in the UK are located. The project seeks to produce the first in what could be a series of annual analyses of UK retail geography. In particular, the project will explore the changing character of retail places and consider the continued relevance of 'hierarchies' of centres; develop measures of vulnerability and resilience for places; look at short term change as well as considering what UK retail places might look like in five years time given what we know about present trends and drivers.&lt;/p>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

1. Policymakers at both national and local government level
2. Real estate investors, professionals and analysts
3. Retailers
4. Academics engaged in retail, real estate or in research into the spatial nature of commercial activity

How will they benefit from this research?

1. Policymakers. The economic and social consequences of changing spatial distribution of retailing activity has been of longstanding concern to both national and local policymakers and have been reflected in a plethora of guidelines, statutory instruments and other forms of regulation designed to achieve particular outcomes in spatial terms. Most recently, this has been focused upon measures to address the decline in UK high streets. But much of this policymaking has nevertheless occurred in the absence of empirical data and analysis of the distribution of retail activity. Evidence-based insight will improve the quality and precision of financial incentives and regulatory intervention designed to support or develop retail places.

2. Real estate investors, professionals and analysts. As major stakeholders through their ownership of and investment in retail places, real estate professionals will benefit from more accurate, timely and comparable analysis of the geography of retail provision in the UK, permitting better informed decision-making over investment opportunities.

3. Retailers. Many large retailers are re-evaluating the extent and distribution of their investment in real estate as a result of: the economic downturn, the growth of multichannel retailing and e-commerce and the redistribution of discretionary spending into superstores and out of town general merchandisers. Smaller retailers need a readily accessible means of understanding how the locations in which they are trading are evolving. Both types of retailer will benefit from being in the position to make better informed decisions as a result of this research.

4. Academics etc. There is a rich vein of work amongst academics interested in the spatial evolution of retail places. In that it provides evidence-based analysis, this research will directly assist scholars in their understanding of the changing spatial nature of commercial activity.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>29050</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Local Data Company</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Further collaboration with Local Data Company</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3F9C81F-D00F-47C3-88E9-39E6788D73CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes described in other outcome categories, and in the form of PI and partner's involvement in Consumer Data Research Centre (an ESRC Data Investment).

Previously, much of this analysis had focused on the negatives (including vacancy rates and cost regimes) and was largely deficient in other evidence. This research has successfully sought to provide a more rigorous and positive evidence base for understanding the changing nature of UK high streets. There were three main targets for the project's impact strategy:

1. Policymakers. Despite widespread recent concern and attention, much policymaking in this area has nevertheless occurred in the absence of empirical data and analysis of the distribution of retail activity. Our evidence-based insight has sought to enhance the quality and precision of financial incentives and regulatory intervention designed to support or develop retail places.

2. Real estate investors, professionals and analysts. Those who own, invest in or manage retail places are benefiting from more accurate, timely and comparable analysis of the geography of retail provision in the UK, permitting better informed decision-making over investment opportunities. These effects are naturally not immediately demonstrable, but the extensive dissemination of the research to these &amp;amp; to retail firms is designed to build awareness and a number of firms have acquired access to the detailed data.

3. Retailers. Our findings are designed to help both large retailers re-evaluating the distribution of their investment in real estate as a result of: the economic downturn &amp;amp; the growth of multichannel retailing and e-commerce. Smaller retailers need a readily accessible means of understanding how the locations in which they are trading are evolving. Both types of retailer are now able to benefit from being in the position to make better informed decisions as a result of this research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CB80041B-1902-4498-AFAC-012D77A028F8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The future vitality and viability of the UK's High Streets have attracted considerable attention over the last few years. However, much of this attention - not least recent policy-making in this area - has been based on rhetoric and anecdotal evidence rather than data-driven reality. During a short, 3-month, KEO project, Oxford University researchers and the Local Data Company (LDC) analysed the ways in which the retail mix of over 150,000 shops across 1,300 UK High Streets has changed over the past two years, as well as over the past thirty - using research previously conducted in Oxford. Our findings identified the effects of online retailing, the growth in value outlets and the proliferation of consumer service businesses. For the UK's High Streets to thrive in the future is not just about being big enough to withstand a mixture of economic austerity, online and out-of-town retailing. Whilst many big retail centres continue to be resilient, the most successful smaller town centres are proving to be diverse and versatile, perhaps developing specialist roles. The research team calculated a retail diversity, as well as a service diversity index, for every UK High Street. Our research to date shows that many of the country's High Streets continue to evolve to play the changing roles required of them by residents, workers, visitors and their competitive context - although not always into roles that match the expectations of commentators or politicians, perhaps fed by misplaced nostalgia rather than by the realities that some High Streets face.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of both domestic and international scientific researchers who have found this data and analysis to be of interest and helpful in developing their own thinking.
