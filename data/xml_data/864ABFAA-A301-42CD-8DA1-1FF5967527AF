A systematic analysis will be conducted of the metaphors used by members of different stakeholder groups (patients, unpaid family carers and healthcare professionals) in a 1.5-million-word corpus consisting of interviews and contributions to online fora. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The secondary aim of this project is to investigate the implications of the use of metaphor in the data for existing descriptions and theories of metaphor as a linguistic and cognitive phenomenon. The method that will be employed to identify and analyse metaphor in the data is both qualitative and quantitative. The most innovative aspect of this method is the exploitation of the semantic annotation tool within the online software tool Wmatrix, which will make it possible to identify metaphorical expressions more systematically than is currently possible with other corpus-based methods for the study of metaphor in large data sets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The findings of the project will ultimately be relevant to the provision of end-of-life care, and to the consultancy for, and training of, health professionals.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Since the focus of the project is communication about end-of-life care, the findings of the research are potentially relevant and beneficial to the whole of society. However, the more specific beneficiaries of the research are organizations and individuals involved with end-of-life care, including: healthcare professionals; trainers, leaders and policy-makers in healthcare; governmental and non-governmental agencies; research centres; charities and patients/carers associations. 

We have identified the following organizations and groups as our main beneficiaries, or as channels through which we can reach potential beneficiaries:
1. International Observatory on End of Life Care: the observatory was established in 2003 at Lancaster University and is a globally recognised centre of excellence for research in palliative and end-of-life care; it works closely with the local health and social care community in the North West of England, as well as nationally and internationally; it has a global virtual membership. 
2. European Association for Palliative Care: the EAPC is an NGO recognized by the Council of Europe; it promotes palliative care in Europe and brings together a large number of national associations. 
3. The NHS National End of Life Care programme: the programme works with health and social care services across all sectors in England to improve end-of-life care for adults by implementing the Department of Health's End-of-Life Care Strategy. 
4. Help the Hospices: Help the Hospices is the national charity for the hospice movement, and includes approximately 80 per cent of hospices in the country; it supports hospices throughout the UK through grant-aid, training, education, information, national fundraising and advice.
5. The National Cancer Research Institute: the NCRI is a UK-wide partnership between the government, charity and industry which promotes co-operation in cancer research among 21 member organisations for the benefit of patients, the public and the scientific community; its website provides a single source of information for research and initiatives relevant to patients.
6. Members of online fora representing the three stakeholder groups involved in our research: patients, unpaid family carers and healthcare professionals. Relevant fora include: www.pain-talk.co.uk (health professionals), http://community.macmillan.org.uk/forums/ (patients), and http://www.carersuk.org/Forums/ (carers).
7. Members of the Lancaster University Research Partner forum; the group includes members of different stakeholder groups (e.g. cancer sufferers and family carers) and is funded by Cancer Experiences Collaborative (CECo); it meets monthly and collaborates with researchers by helping to develop new projects and providing feedback on research proposals.

The members of these different groups will benefit from an increased awareness of how metaphor is used by the three stakeholder groups represented in our data in order to convey their experiences of, and approach to, end-of-life care, and particularly to express their attitudes, emotions and evaluations, perceptions of themselves, others and their mutual relationships, and views on personal and professional issues and challenges. Some uses of metaphor may reflect or contribute to anxiety, frustration and misunderstanding. Similarities and differences in metaphor use within and across different stakeholder groups may lead to communicative breakthroughs or communicative problems. Our findings will therefore be relevant to those involved in treating and caring for patients, in the training of health professionals, in advocacy on behalf of patients and unpaid carers, and in policy-making, especially in the area of communication between health-care providers and patients. Overall, the findings of the project can therefore contribute to the improvement of provision for patients approaching the end of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>175074</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research on metaphors and cancer reported in Swedish newspaper</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D0C24DDC-0757-4C41-9975-F8CC715792B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research was mentioned in a Swedish newspaper</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.svd.se/dags-att-sluta-kampa-mot-cancern</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at Cancer Research UK, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1AAC8D7C-251F-4620-B367-A4447437118B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was followed by a lengthy discussion session.

Abstract - In this talk I show how the methods of Corpus Linguistics are being applied to the study of health communication in two current projects at Lancaster University. The 'Metaphor in End-of-Life Care' project (funded by the UK's Economic and Social Research Council) combines 'manual' analysis and corpus linguistic methods in a large-scale study of the metaphors used by terminally ill patients, unpaid family carers and healthcare professionals to talk about the experience of end of life care. Among other things, the use of a semantic annotation tool has resulted in a new account of the controversial 'war metaphor' in relation to (terminal) illness, especially as used by patients in our data. This has implications for training and practice in the provision of end-of-life care. Corpus methods are also being applied to the assessment of a language-based tool for the diagnosis of chronic pain, the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). The MPQ includes 78 one-word descriptors of pain, such as 'sharp' and 'burning'. The findings of a corpus-based analysis of the use of each descriptor in English generally were correlated with the choices made by 300 patients who completed the questionnaire at a London Hospital. It has been found that differences in the general linguistic behaviour of the 78 descriptors seem to interfere with patients' choices in ways that undermine the MPQ's effectiveness as a diagnostic tool. Further corpus-based research will result in a fuller assessment of the MPQ, and in the creation of a new, more reliable version of the questionnaire. On the basis of the achievements of both projects, I argue that corpus linguistic methods can make an important contribution to the study of health communication, and to research-based interventions in healthcare practices.

The event, entitled 'Language in End-of-Life Care' attracted an audience of approximately forty participants, consisting primarily of healthcare professionals and researchers specialising in palliative and end-of-life care. Although most participants are based in the UK, international guests joined us from Germany, the Netherlands, Spain and the US.

Professor Sheila Payne (Co-Investigator on the project and Co-Director of Lancaster's International Observatory on End-of-Life Care), opened proceedings and acted as chair for the day's activities. Two high-profile invited speakers shared their perspectives on communication in end-of-life care. Professor Lukas Radbruch (Chair of Palliative Medicine, University of Bonn) gave a presentation entitled 'The search for a final sense of meaning in end-of-life discourses'. Among other things, he emphasized the influence of language and culture on perceptions and attitudes towards end of life and end-of-life care. Professor Dame Barbara Monroe (Chief Executive of St Christopher's Hospice, London) discussed the main current challenges in hospice care in a talk entitled 'Listening to patient and professional voices in end-of-life care'. These challenges, she argued, include those posed by a variety of linguistic and communicative barriers.

The methods, data and findings of the 'Metaphor in End-of-Life Care' project were introduced by four members of the team: Professor Elena Semino (Principal Investigator), Dr Veronika Koller (Co-Investigator), Dr Jane Demmen (Research Associate) and Dr Zs&amp;oacute;fia Demj&amp;eacute;n (former Research Associate, currently at the Open University). The project involves a combination of 'manual' and corpus-based methods to investigate the metaphors used to talk about end-of-life care in a 1.5-million-word corpus consisting of interviews with and online forum posts by terminally ill patients, family carers and health professionals. The team introduced the findings from the analysis that are particularly relevant to practitioners in end-of-life care, namely: the use of 'violence' and 'journey' metaphors by terminally ill patients, and the narratives of 'good' and 'bad' deaths told by hospice managers in semi-structured interviews. The implications of these findings for end-of-life care were suggested by the team and discussed with the audience. Participants were also invited to discuss selected uses of metaphors from the health professionals' data, and to consider the potential value of some creative, alternative metaphors for cancer in particular.

The richness of the interactions on the day and the liveliness of the event's hashtag on Twitter (#melc14) suggest that the event was a success. In the words of a hospice director: 'everybody at the conference was truly inspired by the potential for change in practice and training!' Although the funded phase of the project is coming to an end, the contacts made on the day are likely to lead to further collaborative research between the Lancaster team and healthcare professionals in the UK and beyond.

Several participants tweeted about the event. A hospice manager wrote a piece about it for the online magazine eHospice. We were also invited to hold a similar session at St Joseph's Hospital (London) in September 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/melc/workshop_may2014.php</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release on 'Metaphor in End of Life Care Project' at Lancaster University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BB491EF-0363-4D5F-8D57-510235B780D4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On 30th September 2013, Lancaster University issued an online news item on the project, entitled 'Study examines how we talk about dying' http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/news/articles/2013/study-examines-how-we-talk-about-dying/

A patient-support initiative based on our findings is currently underway at Preston Royal Infirmary.

We have engaged with healthcare professionals through our end-of-project User event, presentations at two healthcare conferences, multiple blog posts for healthcare organisations, and invited workshop at St Joseph's Hospice in London and St John's Hospice in Lancaster. As of February 2017, our article in BMJ Supportive and Palliative Care has an Altmetric score of 92, and was the most read paper in that journal between February 2015 and January 2016. We have engaged with two local cancer patient charities by presenting our work at their meetings. We have been been invited to present to staff at the London headquarters of both Macmillan Cancer Research and Cancer Research UK. We have engaged with the general public through our website, articles in national and international press outlets, radio interviews and a piece in the Conversation in April 2015. The latter piece has been read over 2,000 times; he project website had over 18,000 page views from over 4,000 unique visitors; the videos on the project site have had over 2,300 views; and the total reach of the news reports on our research totals several million people.

We have received reports from healthcare professionals and the general public about the relevance and influence of our work on their approach to illness and care. A hospice deputy director commented online after attending our User event that: 'We got what they [the project team] did, how, why and relevance to person centred care' (http://www.ehospice.com/uk/ArticleView/tabid/10697/ArticleId/10653/language/en-GB/View.aspx). After the same event, a hospice director wrote on Twitter: 'Am listening in a new way!'. The feedback on our session at St Joseph's Hospice in London included comments such as the following: 'Will help with my area of care, will help me understand and think about what my patients and relatives are actually telling me. Will make me reflect and respond more appropriately'. Many members of the public have written to us about how our work has validated or contributed to their views about the importance of the language that is used for cancer and the end of life. Several people with cancer or post-cancer voluntarily sent us their own writings to be included in our work. The analysis we carried out for Macmillan Cancer Research has been described in writing by a staff member as 'incredibly useful' for the development of their next fundraising campaign. 

On the basis of the findings of the research, we have developed a 'Metaphor Menu' - a collection of quotations from our cancer patient data and other sources, accompanied by images. The goal of the Menu is to enable people with cancer to recognise or discover one or more metaphors that can help them cope better with their illness. The members of the Lancaster University Research Partners Forum and of two local cancer support groups have given us feedback on the Menu, and encouraged us to share it widely with patients. An oncologist at Preston Royal Infirmary is currently distributing the Menu to patients with a new cancer diagnosis. A group of Berkeley students working for 'Design for America' has used some aspects of the Menu to develop an app for children with cancer.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D9A72102-E3CD-4909-9F26-625478EAD4BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We analysed approximately 6,000 uses of metaphor in a 1.5-million-word corpus of interviews with and online forum posts by: terminally ill cancer patients, family carers and healthcare professionals. These metaphors draw primarily from the semantic domains of: Violence, Journeys, Machinery, Religion and Magic, Sports and Games, Wholeness, Openness, Restraint, Containment and Obstacles.
1. We analysed Violence and Journey metaphors in the corpus, as they are particularly relevant to current practices in healthcare and media debates. Healthcare professionals use these metaphors less frequently than the other two groups, and to express different topics and attitudes. Patients use them to express a variety of aspects of their experiences. Violence and Journey metaphors provide different framings of the patients' experience: Violence metaphors typically involve an opponent (the illness, the treatment, the healthcare system, etc.), while Journey metaphors do not. Patients' Violence metaphors can express and reinforce negative feelings, but they can also have a positive, empowering function; Journey metaphors can express and reinforce positive feelings, but can also have a negative, disempowering function. 

2. We analysed the metaphors patients use to express their views of their relationship with healthcare professionals. Some metaphors suggest a grateful and trusting view: healthcare professionals are presented as saints and magicians, and as engaged in a fight on the patients' behalf. Other metaphors express a negative view of the relationship: healthcare professionals are described as enemies, attackers or reluctant providers of weaponry (treatment). Patients' metaphors often emphasize their perception of an imbalance of power and knowledge in the relationship, as well as the idea that healthcare professionals may not always prioritise patients' interests. 

3. We analysed the metaphors used by family carers to express the emotional experiences associated with their role. Carers use metaphors of Violence, Movement and Containment to express feelings of anxiety, fear, isolation and shame. 

4. We analysed the metaphors and narratives used by hospice managers to express their views of 'good' and 'bad' deaths. Good deaths are described by means of 'narratives of successful interventions' and metaphors of peace, openness, freedom from pain, and acceptance of death as the end of one's journey. Bad deaths are described by means of 'narratives of frustrated intervention' and metaphors of struggle, battle and rejection of support. 

5. From a theoretical perspective, we have found that the idea that different metaphors 'frame' topics in different ways provides a useful link between cognitively-oriented and discourse-oriented approaches to metaphor. However, the notion of 'framing' needs to include agency, evaluations and emotional associations. Moreover, expressions belonging to the same broad 'source domain' (in terms of current cognitive approaches to metaphor) can provide quite different framings for a particular experience. The more specific notion of 'scenario' can better account for metaphor and framing, but consideration also needs to be given to variation depending on individual user, linguistic expressions and context.

Future work will explore further metaphor patterns and their theoretical and practical implications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The negative attitudes and unmet needs that are suggested by some of the metaphors we have identified require attention in the context of healthcare provision. This applies, for example, to the tendency for some patients to describe themselves as engaged in a fight with healthcare professionals, or as being under attack from their treatment (see 1 and 2 in top box above).
 
Our findings concerning Violence and Journey metaphors (see 1 in top box above) suggest that no metaphor is intrinsically good or bad for all patients. Rather, different metaphors suit different people, or even the same person at different times. Hence, the current tendency to reject fight-related metaphors for cancer in particular may be detrimental for patients who find them meaningful and motivating; conversely, the uncritical promotion of Journey metaphors ignores the disempowering ways in which they can be used. This has implications for how healthcare professionals listen and react to patients' metaphors, and introduce metaphors themselves.
Our findings on hospice managers' descriptions of 'good' and 'bad' death (see 4 in top box above) suggest a uniformity of views that may make it difficult for patients and their families to have alternative views recognised and accepted.

The feedback we have received from healthcare professionals suggests that our dissemination activities have started to influence their attitudes and practices. We are currently preparing a 'Metaphor menu' to be piloted as a possible source of inspiration and comfort to newly-diagnosed cancer patients.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5BF71500-3E50-4F3C-A1B4-A44B818E8432</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/melc/index.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8F9148D4-4A16-446C-89F6-04E9C6C8C600"><gtr:id>8F9148D4-4A16-446C-89F6-04E9C6C8C600</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metaphern in der Palliativversorgung und Sterbebegleitung</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Leidfaden</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ea6b9eb91013833b6684c5f8512fc069"><gtr:id>ea6b9eb91013833b6684c5f8512fc069</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koller V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1C962439-6ED8-4FC0-97C0-84A05B72CE10"><gtr:id>1C962439-6ED8-4FC0-97C0-84A05B72CE10</gtr:id><gtr:title>Laughing at cancer: Humour, empowerment, solidarity and coping online</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Pragmatics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3c4d17aafb16a6d15664bb70947dd3a5"><gtr:id>3c4d17aafb16a6d15664bb70947dd3a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Demj?n Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F20831F0-84D3-4F62-B3CF-3E261692245E"><gtr:id>F20831F0-84D3-4F62-B3CF-3E261692245E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metaphor - Embodied Cognition and Discourse</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f10d20c135b81b87165fa3fe8acb826c"><gtr:id>f10d20c135b81b87165fa3fe8acb826c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Semino E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CD461B25-D4AF-4A85-8A94-432A3F4F730B"><gtr:id>CD461B25-D4AF-4A85-8A94-432A3F4F730B</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Good' and 'bad' deaths: Narratives and professional identities in interviews with hospice managers</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discourse Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f10d20c135b81b87165fa3fe8acb826c"><gtr:id>f10d20c135b81b87165fa3fe8acb826c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Semino E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B256B014-CA35-4EF1-A173-00E5D08AC394"><gtr:id>B256B014-CA35-4EF1-A173-00E5D08AC394</gtr:id><gtr:title>Metaphors for 'good' and 'bad' deaths: A health professional view</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Metaphor and the Social World</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3c4d17aafb16a6d15664bb70947dd3a5"><gtr:id>3c4d17aafb16a6d15664bb70947dd3a5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Demj?n Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FE2AE6FE-AA47-4A1A-B75A-D280F0906183"><gtr:id>FE2AE6FE-AA47-4A1A-B75A-D280F0906183</gtr:id><gtr:title>The online use of Violence and Journey metaphors by patients with cancer, as compared with health professionals: a mixed methods study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BMJ supportive &amp;
