In the 20th Century it became increasingly understood that it can be profitable to consider the collection of all mathematical objects of some type: we might consider the space whose points correspond to triangles in the plane, in which moving the three vertices of the triangle around defines a path.

These spaces of mathematical objects, &amp;quot;moduli spaces&amp;quot; as they are known, have become an object of study which can be approached from many areas of mathematics, each of which give a particular insight. The most intensely studied moduli space, and the first example of one, is the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. This is difficult to visualise directly: a point of this space corresponds to a surface, such as a ball or the layer of sugar on a (American) doughnut, and moving around in this space corresponds to bending and stretching the surface. Because this space is so difficult to visualise, abstract tools must be used to get a feel for it: to get an idea of the topological complexity of the space, the most successful of these are homology and cohomology.

This project will investigate moduli spaces of higher-dimensional manifolds, focussing on their homology and cohomology. That is, it will consider spaces whose points are d-dimensional manifolds (so rather than being surfaces, which locally look like 2-dimensional space, they are spaces which locally look like d-dimensional space), and where movement in this space corresponds to bending and stretching. Manifolds are the fundamental objects studied in Geometry, so the space of all manifolds of a given dimension is intimately related to many questions that can be asked in this subject. Part of this project is to use and develop a strong new tool which has been created by Galatius and the PI, in order to investigate geometric questions in a certain ``stable range&amp;quot;. In addition, the project will introduce new methods to understand moduli spaces of manifolds outside of this ``stable range&amp;quot;, where a systematic picture is lacking.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project constitutes basic research in Pure Mathematics, and as such it is not expected to have immediate or foreseeable Economic or Societal impact. However, the subject of Algebraic Topology has recently begun to have applications, to analysis of high-dimensional data sets, sensing networks, and complex systems arising in Biology. This project is not in the direction of these applications, but by addressing central and difficult questions in a cutting-edge subfield of Topology, it broadens our theoretical understanding of the nature of high-dimensional spaces, which lie at the heart of all these applications. 

The research will be of benefit to Mathematicians working in Topology, Geometry, and Algebra. In particular, by investigating the relationship between tautological rings of higher-dimensional manifolds and those of Riemann surfaces, it shall create new connections between Algebraic Topology and Algebraic Geometry, connections which will provide insight to workers in both fields. By helping to develop the PIs research network, and allowing him to dedicate much of his time to research, this project will accelerate his career development, and by promoting research on questions of great current international interest it will help maintain the UK's position as a world leader in higher education and scientific research, especially in Geometry and Topology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>90898</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M027783/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>DEA11FBC-BEED-4EDD-890B-97D728462D26</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mathematical sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>27F853CB-FB22-4B9D-82D7-542648D097F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Algebra &amp; Geometry</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
