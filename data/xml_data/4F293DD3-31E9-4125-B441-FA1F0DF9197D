comprises a Commissioned Partnership Programme in support of the What Works Centre for Crime Reduction based in the College of Policing. The programme aims to develop a stronger evidence base for crime reduction. It will enhance the UK?s capacity to develop, disseminate and apply evidence-based approaches to crime reduction and make such evidence readily available to crime reduction practitioners. There will be an emphasis throughout on understanding not simply what works, but how it works. The project aims to position the UK as the preferred trainer for evidence-based crime reduction.&lt;br />&lt;br />The programme will: &lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>assess and make available existing systematic reviews, synthesising existing evidence that speaks to what works in crime reduction&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>complete 12 new reviews&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>produce a methodology to compare the relative costs and benefits of crime reduction interventions&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>devise a tool to cost crime reduction initiatives&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>design a police development programme to enable practitioners to understand, assess and apply what works evidence to crime problems&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver a pilot of the development programme&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>complete primary research directed at gaps in the knowledge base&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>carry out an independent review of the What Works Centre identifying impact on decision maker.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Crime is a global problem. Developing evidence based techniques for its reduction is of wide interest. This project addresses these challenges. The work is intended to: 
1. Identify and improve the knowledge base for what works in crime reduction 
2. Ensure findings are disseminated to relevant academics and practitioners in the UK and internationally 
3. Develop novel approaches to determining what has worked and will work in specific settings, combining the best of current synthesis techniques
4. Broaden the skill base of prevention practitioners in relation to their understanding, appraisal and use of evidence when implementing crime reduction interventions.
 
There are four major beneficiary groups: academics, practitioners, government and the general public. 
 
Academic impact: An inter-university consortium of UK universities will support the training of highly skilled researchers and facilitate the generation and transfer of new methods of research synthesis across the country. This will make the UK a major source of expertise in assessing what works in crime reduction. It will also establish UK universities as global providers of practitioner training in what works. There is a massive demand for such training particularly in the emerging economies of India and South America. Consultants from a wide international base are being drawn in to assist with the work and in disseminating the later results. UK academics will, we believe, benefit immensely from these contacts, drawn from a range of academic disciplines. 
 
Practitioner impact: With downward pressure on budgets better use needs to be made of research evidence on what works. This programme is intended to support the injection of evidence into decision-making in crime reduction whether by the police, police and crime commissioners, other professional groups, local governments, commerce or industry. The inclusion of costs into this process is important and we intend to develop an approach taking account of where the costs of crime fall. For example, Internet service providers do not carry the costs of Internet crime but are well placed to increase the security of the web. To integrate this programme successfully into practice requires a significant culture change: crime reduction is sometimes neglected and poor use is often made of such evidence on what works as is available. Similarly, we will consider the means of introducing the products of the research into corrections, probation, schools etc. as appropriate and depending upon the topics identified. 

Government impact: It is intended that this work will assist in shaping the crime reduction agenda at national level. Through benchmarking, monitoring and evaluation, the programme will identify current strengths and weaknesses in crime reduction delivery. In doing this, gaps in knowledge and skills will be identified and where possible filled and good practice will be shared via accessible but academically rigorous dissemination. This should assist government departments in ensuring relevant, high quality evidence is delivered to those involved in public service. 
 
Societal impact: The application of the results will contribute to increased well-being of citizens, particularly the more disadvantaged amongst whom crime and disorder tend to concentrate. Crime should be reduced at reduced cost. Internationally the programme may contribute to reduced crime by informing crime reduction activities in both British and non-British jurisdictions. The results may also help address trans-national organised crime, which impacts the UK as much as elsewhere. 
 
The programme will also: 
1. Contribute to increased public awareness of successful crime reduction methods.
2. Highlight areas where further research and development are needed.
3. Inform and improve national debates on policies relating to effective crime reduction through seminars, conferences, and media contacts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2588315</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>One day seminar on What Works: Australian Institute of Police Management</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F10FC97B-C59C-48F2-BE9B-F0E90F7A7EFD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professors Gloria Laycock and Nick Tilley developed a full day programme on 'What Works' for the Australian Institute of Police Management.

Work package 1 of the project, which is now complete, resulted in the identification of almost 40 systematic reviews on crime reduction - the first such exhaustive exercise in this domain. These reviews have now been summarised following the framework developed under work package 3 (the EMMIE framework) and 35 narratives have been added to the new Crime Reduction Toolkit developed by the project team in conjunction with the UK College of Policing and which has been available online since mid-2015 at: http://whatworks.college.police.uk/toolkit/Pages/Toolkit.aspx. 
The toolkit is an open access facility and is now accessed by the police, Police and Crime Commissioners and others with an interest in crime reduction. This toolkit is impacting on how police forces and other crime reduction agencies from the public and third sector make decisions with regards to which interventions to adopt when tackling specific crime problems. The College of Policing - co-sponsors of this project - are strongly promoting this toolkit to ensure that all the key audiences are engaged with it. The toolkit, and the EMMIE methodology, mark a bold new attempt to embed evidence-based practise into the thinking of police practitioners in particular, and crime reduction professionals and academics at large. To this end presentations on the EMMIE framework and the toolkit have been made to forces across the UK, in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the USA and other parts of Europe. In addition the framework has been welcomed by other 'what works' centres in the UK as a step change in conveying the output from research to practitioners. 
A pilot training package was developed for the EMMIE framework (work package 6), which was piloted in four police forces over the summer of 2015 (work package 7). This was well received by those trained and the programme is being developed for further dissemination. 
Under work package 5 of the project advice has been generated on costing crime reduction initiatives and a tool to aid police and other crime reduction practitioners is now available as a spreadsheet and in an accompanying book entitled &amp;quot;Economic Analysis and efficiency in policing, criminal justice and crime reduction: what works&amp;quot;. Interest from a number of police forces indicates that this element of the project may have a healthy future economic impact on practitioner decision-making.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>B73705B7-E005-4BF2-BE43-6A942524BCDE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Mapped the evidence base on what works in crime reduction in the form of systematic reviews.
