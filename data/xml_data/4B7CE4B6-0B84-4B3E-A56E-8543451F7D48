Quantitative Methods Network (AQMeN) Phase II is a Research Centre that aims to develop a dynamic and pioneering set of projects to improve our understanding of current social issues in the UK and provide policy makers and practitioners with the evidence to build a better future. Three principal cross-cutting research strands will exploit existing high-quality data resources: &lt;strong>Education and Social Stratification&lt;/strong> will focus on social class differences in entry to, progression in and attainment at tertiary education and how they affect individuals' labour market outcomes and their civic participation; &lt;strong>Crime and Victimisation&lt;/strong> will explore the dramatic change in crime rates in Scotland and other jurisdictions and examines the determinants and impact of criminal careers amongst populations of offenders; and &lt;strong>Urban Segmentation and Inequality&lt;/strong> which will create innovative new measures of social segmentation and combine these with cutting-edge longitudinal and sorting-model techniques to explore the causes of neighbourhood segmentation, household location choice and neighbourhood inequalities. Five additional projects will focus on the referendum on Scottish independence, location dynamics and ethnicity and exploiting existing datasets. The research will fed into training activities and knowledge exchange events aimed at boosting capacity in quantitative methods amongst the UK social science community.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on policy and practice 
Our policy and practice stakeholders (see Pathways to Impact for details) will benefit from the research through direct and regular engagement that feeds their research priorities into the heart of the research process from the start and throughout the life-time of the project. This direct engagement process will benefit the policy makers in their high level strategic decision making, but also the work of those who support the policy makers (including research analysts, statisticians and economists) who will also have access to the research findings and (where possible) research data to conduct further analysis, if desired. Practitioners will benefit from getting a clearer understanding of how different elements of their operational activity impact on different outputs and outcomes, which will enable them to plan and deliver services more effectively and efficiently. Wider impact will be achieved through the creation of knowledge gateways and champions to ensure the research has wide reach. These outcomes will benefit the public through the delivery of improved public services that are predicated on a robust evidence base, for example: victims of crime, users of the criminal justice system, communities suffering from disadvantage and inequality, students making important life choices at school, young people with substance misuse problems or other health behaviours, and members of general public who are considering their constitutional future. 

Some specific areas of policy that we will target our impact strategy towards includes: 
(1) The contribution of evidence to key policy debates including: the impact of the new police reforms to create a single Scottish force; whether Scottish Government achieves key National Outcomes such as 'we live our lives safe from crime, disorder and danger' and 'we have tackled the significant inequalities in Scottish society'; the effectiveness and impact of the new Curriculum for Excellence in Scotland; and Scotland's Agenda for Cities (2012) and the ongoing commitment to 'support disadvantaged communities' and 'ensure that opportunities are available to all'. 
(2) Feeding into strategic thinking around the Long Term Strategy for Population Surveys in Scotland 2009-2019 developed by the Office of the Chief Statistician, which will also support the ongoing work into alternatives to the Census. 
(3) Contribute to the Data Linkage Framework for Statistics and Research, developed by Scottish Government, and the establishment of a data linkage centre through collaboration between the Information Services Division and the National Records of Scotland. Our programme of knowledge exchange and public lectures (aimed at a very wide audience from all sectors) will continue to be of benefit in a general sense to those with an interest in specific areas of social science research, and may result in wider collaborative projects (as occurred during Phase I). 

Public impact
We also anticipate benefiting new public audiences through our 'public engagement' strategy which will involve the media, Getstats and the Beltane Public Engagement Network in finding new and innovative ways of getting our research findings heard and understood by, for example, school children, community groups and other receptive audiences. We hope to have impact not only by enriching public knowledge about the areas of research under study, but also by finding new ways of increasing people's statistical literacy. This element of the work will be supported by the creation of an Associate Dean in Quantitative Methods and a new Chair at the University of Edinburgh (UoE) to support AQMeN activities (this represents a commitment of UoE made at Phase 1). They will develop and deliver the 'Stats for All' campaign at UoE providing open and equal access to numerical training for all students (and staff) throughout their degrees. Similar activities are also planned at University of Glasgow.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3787299</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>GIS &amp;amp; Visualisation (Urban Big Data Centre Workpackage MRP3.4)</gtr:description><gtr:id>6CFB6ECB-09CE-4BBE-8971-041093AD90D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet.

It is aimed both at students with an interest in criminology and with an interest in survey methods/regression techniques more generally, as both substantive and methodological questions will be addressed.

The event will include an introduction to the survey, its content and history with a focus on highlighting suggestions about types of research topics that could be addressed with the rich data it contains. This will be followed by discussions about the survey design to emphasise methodological issues and the presentation of relevant findings using meaningful techniques, in particular based on regression frameworks.

To extend the scope, the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime survey will also be introduced, to show participants the wealth of topical data that is available to them. No prior knowledge of either the substantive field or the techniques used is expected. There will be room for questions and discussion. The event will be useful for anyone interested in the themes described, but will also be a meaningful addition for the students on the regression modelling course offered during the summer school.

Sarah MacQueen, who works as a researcher at the Scottish Centre for Crime and Justice Research based at the University of Edinburgh with extensive experience in using this survey, will be leading the presentations at the event.

The morning session was a seminar introducing the survey and the afternoon session a practical data workshop for those who would like to use the data themselves.

The Scottish Health Survey (SHeS) provides a detailed picture of the health of the Scottish population. Focusing on private households, it is a key resource for the government in health policy development, in identifying gaps in service provision, and in identifying groups at risk of future ill-health. The first survey took place in 1995, with subsequent surveys in 1998 and 2003, before moving to a continuous model of data collection in 2008. Data are comparable with the Health Survey for England.

The seminar session provided an introduction to the survey, its design and methodology, the topics covered and how to access the data, including linkage with other datasets. Presentations demonstrated some of the ways in which the data has been used.

Course Content:
&amp;quot;A picture paints a thousand words&amp;quot; In Professor Gayle's experience, with the exception of weighting, graphing data is one of the most troublesome aspects of data analysis. This event will be a practical workshop in which participants will learn more about graphs and the graphical presentation of data and results. There will be a wide range of social science examples that demonstrate how to get more from the graphical and presentational features of Stata. The workshop will help participants produce better quality graphs in their research outputs.

This lecture will consider the dramatic change in patterns of crime that have been observed in Scotland in recent years and explore whether it represents real cultural and behavioural change. Specifically, it will explore the place of young people in this changing landscape and consider the implications for changes in patterns of offending - at both the aggregate and the individual levels - on our formal responses to the problem of youth offending. The lecture will present key findings from two major programmes of research - the Applied Quantitative Methods Network Crime and Victimisation Study and the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime - to highlight the increasing importance of quantitative research in informing theory, policy and practice. In exploring these issues, both the challenges and the opportunities of building capacity in quantitative criminology will be considered.&amp;quot;

Professor Gillian Raab - Statistician (University of St Andrews)
Dr Kevin Ralston - SLS Support Officer (University of St Andrews)
Dr Lee Williamson - SLS Support Officer (University of St Andrews)

Course Content:
The Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) links together routinely collected administrative data for a 5.3% representative sample of the Scottish population (about 270,000 people). It includes a wealth of information from the censuses (currently 1991 and 2001), vital events registrations (births, deaths, marriages), weather and pollution data, and education data from 2007 onwards. The SLS with appropriate permissions can also be linked to other health data sources such as cancer registry and hospital admission data from the NHS in Scotland. Additionally, the 2011 Census data will be linked to the SLS.

The size and scope of the SLS make it an unparalleled resource for analysing a range of socio-economic, demographic and health questions, including those which are based on reasonably rare events. The longitudinal nature of the SLS is particularly valuable, it provides insights into the health and social status of the Scottish population and, how it changes over time. The SLS data includes the dates at which SLS members experience outcomes such as marriage, widowhood, death etc. To analyse such data we can calculate the time to event of interest and use survival analysis techniques to compare groups.

Part one of the course will introduce the SLS and the types of research that can be done with the SLS, along with details on accessing the SLS and procedures for requesting linked NHS data. To develop an understanding of the SLS an introduction to the SLS data dictionary is given alongside some group-work using the SLS data dictionary. To attend part one sign up using the Register button at the bottom of this page.

Part two of the course will introduce methods to display and model time to event data, including Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox proportional hazards regression. The survival analysis theory will be complimented with hands-on practical sessions using either SPSS, Stata or R on the SLS training dataset. Presentations of real SLS projects will also be given to demonstrate research potential.

Using data from a survey conducted in six EU member states in January 2016, Jan, Dan and Christine will present insights from their evaluation of the potential for contagion effects. Their initial analysis is based on simple binary logistic regressions identifying what drives citizens to want their own referendum and also how they might vote if they were granted such a referendum. A discussion of more complex possibilities using the same and other survey data will follow.

Statistical models are increasingly common in social science research. Many researchers whose interests are substantive rather than methodological struggle to understand these techniques and are disinclined to engage with research that employs these approaches. This workshop is designed for researchers who would like to learn about statistical modelling. 

This half day seminar was orientated towards researchers who do not normally use statistical methods but wanted to be introduced to statistical modelling. It was ideal for busy researchers who did not have time to go on longer workshops or courses. It was also a useful refresher course for researchers whose last encounter with statistics was during their undergraduate degree. 

The event was intended to be engaging and informative and there were a number of group activities, as well as audience participation and practical demonstrations. 

This workshop was a taster session. Conceptual ideas relating to statistical modelling were introduced at a level that, although technically elementary, showed how statistical ideas could address major social scientific issues. The workshop pointed to training courses (in AQMeN and at other UK universities) where greater depth of technical competence could be acquired.

The first two days of the course will focus particularly on exploring and mapping data released pre-aggregated to a commonly used geographical unit (polygon area) such as the standard statistical geographies data zones, super output areas or census tracts (for example Census data or data released by Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics). We will also briefly look at how to produce maps providing context about an area (e.g. roads, rivers, administrative boundaries) and how you might visualise your own individual level data with a geographic identifier at an aggregate level.

The third day will give participants an introduction to the key exploratory spatial data analysis concepts of spatial autocorrelation and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). Day 3 will focus on how to explore and visualise whether there are underlying spatial associations in data relating to place (e.g. data on neighbourhoods or regions) and understanding why this might be useful.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.aqmen.ac.uk/events/Jun2016/GIS</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Under-18s 'should be given right to vote'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A319FD7A-FA7C-4BE9-B59F-10A25AC5EB4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Under-18s 'should be given right to vote' - Jan Eichhorn</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/under-18s-should-be-given-right-to-vote-1-3570884</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SIPR - Police Scotland Training</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F30029B-A5D4-42CF-9776-B972313A130A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training event for Police Scotland led by S McVie and V Gayle</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Declining Crime, Different Offenders?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF0E8BC8-5E8C-4430-A00A-A075AF265C91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Declining Crime, Different Offenders? - Cutting Crime in a Changing World, Home Office Conference, London, January 2015 - Matthews, B. - 28/01/2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Training Event 2010: Introduction to multilevel modelling using MLwiN</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30DDF3E7-2611-4935-B402-B554DAE2605D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participant : Participation in workshop, seminar, course

Chaired by BBC Scotland's Gordon Brewer and incorporated into 2014's much celebrated Edinburgh Fringe Festival, highlights from the conference included results from the latest Scottish Social Attitudes survey, a panel debate featuring some of Scotland's top political journalists and talks from leading experts on some of the key issues in the debate on Scottish independence.

The conference was of interest to anyone who needed to understand how (and why) Scotland might vote on 18th September 2014. The conference was held in collaboration with the ESRC's Future of UK and Scotland initiative.

The main aim of the study is to provide new information to support policy-making in Scotland but it is also intended to provide a resource for practitioners, academics, the voluntary sector and parents. It studies two birth cohorts and their parents, with 8 sweeps of the first birth cohort already completed or in the field. This makes good skills in data management and manipulation a prerequisite for using the data effectively, as well as knowledge of how to deal with panel or repeated measures designs in analysis of the data.

Now combined into one survey, the Scottish Household Survey provides information on the composition, characteristics, attitudes and behaviour of households and individuals at national and sub-national level. The survey allows relationships between social variables within households to be explored, which supports cross-disciplinary analysis of topics such as social justice and welfare-to-work. This event aims to raise awareness and knowledge about the Scottish Household Survey (SHS). 

Course content:
This half-day seminar will provide an introduction to the SHS, including a detailed introduction on the background to the survey, why it is important in policy terms, and the design and methodology of the survey. This will be followed by three presentations from expert users of the SHS, who will talk about how they have used the data to investigate important topics for both policy and theory.

Trainer(s): Dr Judith Offerhaus, University of Cologne

This two-day course gives an overview of sequence analysis as a method of longitudinal research. Despite its mostly descriptive and exploratory nature, it provides valuable inside into on-going dynamics, which are disregarded in static types of analyses.

Course Instructor:
Dr. Jan Eichhorn, University of Edinburgh

Course Overview:
Fast track introductory and intermediate quantitative methods course aimed at PhD students who were due to commence their PhD in the social sciences in 2013. Successful candidates took part in a two-week long intensive course that covered two semesters worth of quantitative methods materials and thus gave students the opportunity to apply quantitative methods from an early point in their doctoral research. After successful completion of the full course and an assignment, a certificate of completion was awarded.

The course started with a summary of the different methods of measuring crime, touching on recent newspaper debates on the relative merits of a survey approach compared to police recording. The rest of the first day comprised of a discussion of various types of study (experimental, and quasi experimental) and methods of analysing such data (matched case-control, case -control and propensity score matching. The second day covered advances in latent class and latent growth curve analysis and latent trajectory modelling for understanding criminal offending.

A highlight of this course was its topicality - most of the references and textbooks were published just before the course date.

Learning Outcomes:
On completion of this course students were able to:

 Understand and fit a wide variety of latent structure models to criminological data. 
 Understand the various types of research design used in quantitative criminological studies. 
 Carry out a propensity score analysis. 
 Gain state of the art knowledge in the analysis of criminological data, and to be able to carry out such analyses. 
 Understand and criticise a number of recent papers published in the literature. 
 Understand the need for design in evaluation, and the various methods used in such evaluation.

Researchers from The University of Edinburgh, Dr Jan Eichhorn and Dr Dan Kenealy, together with Christine H&amp;uuml;bner from German think tank d|part, surveyed more than eight thousand people in six EU member states - Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Spain. 
This was one of four dissemination events that took place in March 2016 and the purpose was to share the findings from the survey and to evaluate the relevance of these findings for the 'Brexit' process and negotiations. This event was well attended with 68 delegates from a variety of sectors, largely the policy sector with a number of representatives from the from universities and private sector as well as the general public including:

This seminar will be presented by Professor Chris Taylor, Cardiff University

Abstract
Following political devolution in the late 1990s and the establishment of the governments for Wales and Scotland, the education systems of the four home countries of the UK have significantly diverged. Not only does that mean that education research in the UK has to be sensitive to such divergence, but that the divergence of policy and practice provides an important opportunity to undertake comparative research within the UK. Such 'home international' comparisons between the four home countries of the UK also provide the opportunity to undertake 'natural experiments' of education policy and practice across similar socio-economic contexts.

Using the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) - a recent longitudinal birth cohort study specifically designed to provide the potential for geographical analysis - the seminar finds considerable variation in child development by country of the UK, with no single story of 'success'. However, the seminar finds that literacy development amongst children in England is, particularly in London, on average, greater than for children elsewhere.

The paper concludes by arguing that 'home international' comparisons must take seriously issues of scale and geography when interpreting the influence of 'national' education systems and policies on educational outcomes.

The event was intended to be engaging and informative. There were lectures and demonstrations, a number of group activities, as well as worked examples. Participants were encouraged to bring along examples of questions to be addressed through use of flow data, and were helped to design analyses to suit their needs.

The workshop was an introductory session. Conceptual ideas relating to analysis of flow data was introduced. The workshop was intended to support material and networks of users of flow data.

Course Content:
Answering causal questions is one of the central concerns of social research. This course provides an introduction into the logic and problems of causal inference with observational data based on the potential outcomes framework of causality and causal graphs. Furthermore, it discusses select statistical methods for causal analysis, including propensity score matching, marginal structural models and instrumental variable estimation. In practical sessions, these methods will be implemented using Stata.

Abstract:
In this paper we examine the impact of social origin on labour market entry and early working careers of tertiary graduates by comparing Germany and the UK, two distinct countries in terms of higher education systems, labour market structures and their linkages. Given the stronger links between education and the labour market and the higher social selectivity at earlier stages of education in Germany than in the UK we expect parents' influence on graduates' labour market returns to be smaller in Germany than in the UK. Moreover, we expect qualitative differences in higher education (e.g.. field of study or prior attainment) to explain the effects of parental education on graduates' outcomes to a larger extent in the UK than in Germany. Taking qualitative differences into account, the remaining direct effect is expected to be larger in the UK than in Germany. This is because of the lower signalling power of a degree in the UK and employers' difficulties to differentiate between the larger number and less selective graduate population. Overall, our empirical results confirm our expectations. They show that there is a gross difference in labour market outcomes among graduates from different social origins and this difference is larger in the UK than in Germany. Most of the social difference is explained by field of study in both countries, but contrary to expectations more so in Germany than in the UK. While we do not see any net effects of parental education on labour market returns in Germany, after controlling for field of study, a significant net effect of high parental education on accessing top-level positions was found for the UK. Furthermore, we observe country convergence in the extent to which graduates' labour market outcomes are affected by parental education five years after graduation.

Course content:
This two-day workshop on data visualisation will equip researchers to be better visual data explorers and communicators. The workshop will be split into four half day sessions, including a short introduction to R. Participants are expected to attend all sessions.

Part 1: Effective data visualisation principles
This half-day session will focus on the fundamentals of effective data visualisation, demonstrating how a better understanding of the principles and practicalities of data visualisation can help researchers to produce more informative and engaging. The principles introduced at this stage will offer a conceptual road map for better understanding the aims and challenges of data visualisation, and are not software or platform specific.

Part 2: An introduction to R
This half-day session will introduce researchers to the powerful, flexible, open source statistical programming language R. The range of visualisations which can be produced in R is effectively unlimited. This session will cover the basics required to use R for data management, exploratory data analysis, and data visualisation. The focus will be on helping researchers to become familiar enough with R to be able to comfortably use it in their research, and continue to learn and develop their knowledge of R over the longer term.

Part 3: Data visualisation using ggplot2 in R
ggplot2 is a data visualisation package for R that combines great flexibility with high aesthetic standards. It is based on the 'grammar of graphics' paradigm developed by Leland Wilkinson, which allows clear and consistent specification of how data are mapped onto images; in short, it provides a precise language for data visualisation. This half-day session will build on the discussion of data visualisation principles introduced in part 1, and the basics of R taught in part 2. The emphasis in this session will be on learning through example, and will contain practical exercises throughout.

Part 4: Visual demography and three-dimensional (3D) data mapping
This final half-day session will discuss the whys and hows of producing visualisations of complex 3D data. The focus will be on demographic data, where rates and amounts of quantities, such as population size and death rates, vary by both age and year. Conceptually, specific age-year combinations can be thought of as co-ordinates, pinpointing spaces on a virtual surface known as a Lexis surface. Lexis surfaces are just one of the countless forms of complex data relationship which can be visualised using these methods. This session will present visualisations of these Lexis surfaces, including both map-based visualisations, and fully 3D renderings, which can be rotated and explored by users. The key features and insights into demographic processes revealed by these visualisations will be discussed. Finally, the practical issues and methods for creating them will be introduced.

Statistical models are increasingly common in social science research. Many researchers whose interests are substantive rather than methodological struggle to understand these techniques and are disinclined to engage with research that employs these approaches. This workshop is designed for researchers who would like to learn about statistical modelling. 

The event was intended to be engaging and informative and there were a number of group activities, as well as audience participation and practical demonstrations. 

This workshop was a taster session. Conceptual ideas relating to statistical modelling were introduced at a level that, although technically elementary, showed how statistical ideas can address major social scientific issues.

The referendum on Scotland's constitutional future in September 2014 which saw 16- and 17-year old voters coming to the polls for the first time at the national level in Scotland. Following on from the AQMeN survey project last year, the team from Edinburgh University's School of Social and Political Science presented updated findings based on a completely new survey conducted in April and May 2014. The survey addressed voters who were be able to participate in the referendum this September but who were under the age of 18 and therefore excluded from other representative surveys on this topic. While some polling institutes included 16- and 17-year olds in their samples, there were too few members of this age group in those polls to allow for any specific in-depth engagement with this age group. 

The only comprehensive, representative survey of this age to date had been conducted as part of this project illustrating how the newly enfranchised young people suggested they would vote in 2014 and it allowed us to examine what drove their decision making. Using the new data we were able to see whether one year later the campaigns have been able to engage with young people in an effective way and thus changing their views and perceptions.

At this event participants heard presentations from the Edinburgh University team members

Appointed a member of the Scottish Government's Independent Advisory Group on Stop and Search in May 2015.

Attended various meetings of the Independent Advisory Group on Stop and Search - presented evidence on the relationship between stop and search and ratees of crime in Scottish communities using data from the AQMeN CVS programme. 

May to Sept 2015

The evidence presented to the Group and the ensuing work resulted in the cessation of non-statutory stop and search and the development of a Code of Practice for all stop and search in Scotland. Recommendation 5, to ensure Police Scotland publishes and makes available on a regular basis, data on stop and search was a direct result of AQMeN input to the Advisory Group.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gov.scot/About/Review/stopandsearch/Report?refresh=0.12071063809197169</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>article in The Scotsman by Chris McCall about my research relating to the fall in homicide in Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C51009AF-F19B-4254-A4F2-FA7863FA35AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>article in The Scotsman by Chris McCall about my research relating to the fall in homicide in Scotland

The morning session was a seminar introducing the survey and the afternoon session was a practical data workshop for those who would like to use the data themselves.

Crime surveys in Scotland were introduced in 1981 to provide an alternative measure of victimisation to that provided by police recorded crime data. The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (and its predecessor the Scottish Crime Survey) is a large-scale national survey of crime victimisation carried out across Scotland. In recent years, it has become one of the Scottish Government's flagship social surveys but it has a limited set of regular users. This event aims to raise awareness and knowledge about the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS). 

This half-day seminar on the SCJS included a detailed introduction to the background, design and methodology of the survey, and why it is important in policy terms.

It studied two birth cohorts and their parents, with 8 sweeps of the first birth cohort already completed or in the field. This created good skills in data management and manipulation a prerequisite for using the data effectively, as well as knowledge of how to deal with panel or repeated measures designs in analysis of the data.

Abstract
While several recent studies have examined social inequalities in enrolment and graduation rates, previous research did not consider the similarly important variation in students' experiences during higher education, for example their participation in the labour market. In our paper we examine class-specific employment patterns among students. In particular, we extend previous approaches by taking into account different local labour market conditions that affect the quantity and quality of jobs available to students. We hypothesise social differences in employment to be more pronounced in less prosperous regions because there, only those students with low reservation wages work, as they need the money for subsistence. However, regarding job quality, social differences would be more pronounced in crowded labour markets, as students from privileged backgrounds would displace students from the lower classes in high-quality jobs. In our empirical analyses we actually find that students with parents that themselves have not graduated are more likely to work than are students with two highly educated parents, and the jobs they occupy are less related to their field of study. Our results also show that under tighter labour market conditions the disadvantages of students from a lower social backgrounds increase.

This research project focused on public attitudes across different EU member states regarding the 23rd June 2016 referendum in the UK about its membership of the European Union. Researchers from The University of Edinburgh, Dr Jan Eichhorn and Dr Dan Kenealy, together with Christine H&amp;uuml;bner from German think tank d|part, surveyed more than eight thousand people in six EU member states - Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and Spain. This was one of four dissemination events that took place in March 2016 and the purpose was to share the findings from the survey and to evaluate the relevance of these findings for the 'Brexit' process and negotiations. 

This event was very well attended with 134 delegates predominantly from the policy sector as well as the third sector and university and business sectors. Attendees included representatives from:

The magnitude of these associations varies by the timing of measurement for mother's employment and cognitive tests as well as the particular country setting. In the present analysis, we investigate the relationship between different cognitive test scores at age five and mothers' complete employment sequence during the first five years after birth, using data on Scottish children and their families from the 'Growing Up In Scotland' study. The focus of prior studies on maternal employment at a particular point in time, neglects a possible cumulative impact on child cognitive skills that is suggested by theory both in case of a positive and a negative relationship. Preliminary results hint at small differences in vocabulary skills between different maternal employment patterns for children who are similar with regard to important background characteristics such as mother's education, household composition, health, and socio-economic context.

During this event results from the first representative survey of 14-17 year olds in Scotland regarding the 2014 independence referendum werepresented. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) a team of researchers from the University of Edinburgh had designed and conducted a Scotland-wide survey of this age group. The understanding of their views is crucial, considering the lowering of the voting age to 16 for the referendum which will see most people in this age group able to cast their vote. Prior to this event there has not been a comprehensive and representative survey of this group.

This event provided the first opportunity to engage with the results from the breadth of themes covered in the survey. The project does not simply provide a poll on the main referendum question, but sets of questions addressing themes relating to:

 Views on the idea of an independent Scotland
 Attitudes towards politics
 Perceptions of national identity
 Differences in socio-demographic background
 Parental views on an independent Scotland

The questions used in the survey are based on existing large-scale adult surveys, but have been piloted also in a school with 110 pupils allowing the research team to refine the questions to become more meaningful to young people. Some reflection on the views from those involved in the pilot will be presented as well. After the presentation of the results there was substantial room for discussion and an outlook for further work with this data.

It will give participants the opportunity to identify which methods may be appropriate and relevant to their own research. 
The event will commence with a networking buffet lunch at which representatives from research organisations will display exhibition stands and be available to discuss their research activities. We will also be showing short-video clips on quantitative methods from previous taster events on-screen and there will be an opportunity to learn more about our AQMeN research projects, including projects focusing on the Scottish independence referendum.
The main event will take the format of six showcase taster sessions which include a general introduction to each technique and provide practical examples of how it has been applied to research and data visualisation can be used in the presentation of results. The following methods will be showcased during this year's event:
? Multiple Imputation
? Statistical Models for Count Data
? Methods of Causal Inference (e.g. Difference-in Differences Estimation, Propensity Score Matching)
? Longitudinal Data Analysis
? Structural Equation Modelling
? Geo-Visualisation
During the event, details of the AQMeN 2014 training programme will be launched which will include opportunities for hands-on training in each of the above techniques later in the year.
The event will close with a panel session 'Q-Step in Scotland: Building the next generation of quantitative scholars'. The aim is to highlight the ways in which the three Scottish Q-Step Centres will strengthen quantitative social science training and develop a new generation of graduates with the skills needed to evaluate evidence, analyse data, and design and commission research. Key questions that members of the panel will address are: how will Q-Step tackle the current skills gaps amongst University entrants; what methods and techniques will graduates be taught; how social science in Scotland will benefit more generally from this initiative; and what are the implications of Q-Step for future postgraduate and early career training.
This event is open to researchers from all over Scotland and the wider UK, providing an opportunity to discuss current issues and advancements with like-minded scholars from a wide variety of backgrounds and institutions.

Details:
Migration and commuting are two important types of geographical mobility, their volumes and patterns are of considerable importance to researchers from multiple disciplines in social sciences as well as to policy makers dealing with economic growth, housing provision and sustainable transport.

With the release of 2011 census flow data, this one-day training workshop introduced the relevant data , the structure of the census flow data, access issues, theoretical concepts and quantitative methods in analysing census flow data.

The workshop was designed to be relevant to people who work in government agencies, charities or other public sectors , as well as staff and students from university departments and research centres. The event was intended to be engaging and informative. There were lectures and demonstrations, a number of group activities, as well as worked examples. Participants were encouraged to bring along examples of questions to be addressed through use of flow data, and were helped to design analyses to suit their needs.

The workshop was an introductory session. Conceptual ideas relating to analysis of flow data were introduced. The workshop was pointed to support material and networks of users of flow data.

However, policy makers, researchers, and even academics are often unaware of the valuable information they can harvest from it, or are unsure of how to go about doing so.



At this major showcase event, experts from three of the most important social surveys in that infrastructure: Understanding Society, the Millennium Cohort Study and the Labour Force Survey will take participants through the principal features of each survey database, the kinds of uses that can be made of them, and how they can be accessed online. Particular attention will be paid to the way each of these sources can be used to make comparisons between Scotland and the rest of the UK, or between different regions of Scotland. Each of these major surveys is also longitudinal: meaning that they are excellent sources for looking at change over time.&amp;quot;

The aims of this event are to:

?Provide an introduction to the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey (SCJS);
?Highlight the opportunities the SCJS offers for conducting research on crime and justice related topics;
?Train researchers in how to navigate and use the various SCJS datasets and its weights. 

 Who should attend:

Anyone wishing to know more about the purpose, design and content of the survey should attend the KE event in the morning. This will highlight why Scottish Government commission the survey, explain some of the technical aspects of its design and include a number of presentations showcasing analysis of the SCJS data on a range of topics.

Researchers who wish to engage with the SCJS data and use it for research purposes should attend both the KE event and the training session in the afternoon. This will provide a practical introduction to the datasets and a hands on approach to exploring some of the key topics in the survey, using both individual surveys and data from repeated surveys.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.aqmen.ac.uk/events/Apr2016/SCJS</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KE Event 2014: Coffee House Lecture, Tinderbox, Ingram Street, Glasgow</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FF59488-E542-4E18-85AF-CE8EF72113EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Public lecture to 100 people including representatives of both Yes/No campaigns

The 2014 Annual Lecture will grapple with the problem of wilful or unintended misuse and misrepresentation of statistics in the media and in popular understanding.
This is nowhere more evident than during political elections and referenda, where data are enthusiastically twisted and distorted by campaigners, leading to myths that can rapidly take on a life of their own. Leading researchers on voting patterns and the statistics of political opinions will speak on the use of data and political myths in the recent Scottish Independence Referendum campaign. The event will be hosted by scientist Dr Emily Grossman who will reflect on the role of statistics and quantitative analysis in society.

The focus will be on the flexibility of the R graphics framework including its ability to deal with novel demands that arise both during data exploration and in result communication. The topics will include combining contour plots of mortality data, using mosaic plots to represent categorical data, and investigating spatial autocorrelation with maps. We will also consider the use of 3D visualisations, and look at an example of how R graphics can be called externally from another programme with less flexible graphics.

Scottish Government Commission on Widening Access 
The Education and Social Stratification (ESS) strand has had significant impact due to extensive, proactive engagement with a wide range of policy representatives and practitioners, disseminating and discussing the implications of its programme of research on curriculum differentiation and social inequality within the Scottish higher education system. In particular, the strand has played a crucial role in informing the work of the Commission on Widening Access (COWA) which was established in 2015 by the First Minister to advise Scottish Government Ministers on how to ensure that children from all social backgrounds have the same chance of entering Higher Education in Scotland. Members of this strand also engaged extensively with representatives from Scottish Government, the Scottish Parliament, widening participation officers from Universities and colleges across Scotland and representatives of the school sector. 

This engagement began with two half-day knowledge exchange (KE) events in May and June 2015 on 'Social inequalities in graduates' job opportunities' and 'School subject choice and inequalities in Higher Education entry'. Research briefing papers were published for both events and there was wide audience participation. Subsequently, COWA launched a call for evidence in the summer of 2015 and Professor Iannelli led a formal AQMeN submission based on the research evidence. Further research findings were presented to the Commission in September 2015, which led to the inclusion of the AQMeN research in the interim and final COWA reports. Also in November, AQMeN held a further KE event on 'Social inequalities in education: why and how national institutional factors matter' as part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science (FoSS). Dame Ruth Silver (Chair of the COWA) agreed to Chair the event and Commission member Russell Gunson participated as a panellist. In conjunction with the FoSS event, Professor Adam Gamoran was invited to speak at a formal dinner - organised by the Moray House School of Education and attended by Angela Constance MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong learning, and Stewart Maxwell MSP, Convenor of the Education &amp;amp; Culture Committee - on the lessons of the 'No Child Left Behind' policy.

In November 2015, Professor Iannelli was invited to participate in the National Improvement Framework roundtable meeting with Scottish Government officials, organised by the Royal Society of Edinburgh (RSE), which led to the publication of RSE Advice Paper 15-25. In December 2015, Professor Iannelli presented AQMeN research at a Widening Access Seminar organised by the University of Edinburgh, an event which also informed the work of CoWA. She also participated in a one-day Expert Group meeting organised by the Scottish Funding Council and chaired by Conor Ryan, a Sutton Trust and CoWA member, on Measures, Tracking, Evidence and Targets to inform the work of CoWA. In January 2016, Professor Iannelli was invited to give expert advice to the Education and Culture Committee at the Scottish Parliament on the Scottish Government policies on closing the attainment gap which aimed to inform an evidence session in February. In February 2016, a further AQMeN KE event was held to disseminate the findings of the new SFC-funded project on inequalities in HE retention. A new research briefing paper Beyond Access to HE: widening access initiatives and student retention in Scotland was published to accompany this event. This project report also directly informed the CoWA final report which was published in March 2016. Following the publication of the CoWA final report, Professor Peter Scott was appointed as Commissioner for Fair Access. In January 2017 Professor Iannelli met with Professor Peter Scott to discuss the findings of the AQMeN research and continue informing governmental policies on widening access to HE. You can view the interim and final reports from the Commission on Widening Access here http://media.wix.com/ugd/785ba4_89804d31da5c4a5a9e599e0297ca955a.pdf and http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0049/00496619.pdf
It is clear that throughout 2015/16 the ESS strand has led a successful programme of engagement. Both the interim and final COWA published reports make direct reference to the AQMeN research findings, and also makes recommendations based on bespoke advice provided on the necessity for more longitudinal data and the need for independent evaluation of initiatives aimed at closing the attainment gap and widening access to higher education. If these research findings are adopted, progress towards a more equitable social distribution of University entrants in Scotland may result in future years.

2. Building safer communities: changing the implementation of crime reduction strategies in Scotland
The Crime and Victimisation Strand (CVS) has been influential in informing the strategic direction of the Scottish Government's flagship Building Safer Communities Programme (BSCP). The BSCP has been involved in implementing a number of place-based initiatives in a range of local pilot areas, building on an assets based approach to reducing crime and improving community wellbeing. Susan McVie (leader of the AQMeN crime research) joined the BSCP Board in 2013 and was appointed the Performance Champion for the programme in 2014. Through her regular contributions to the Board (which meets quarterly), McVie has provided evidence from the AQMeN research around inequalities and the crime drop at national, regional and local level; and findings on the changing profile of both victims and offenders in Scotland. This evidence has been used to develop new policies and practices aimed at significantly reducing the number of victims of crime in Scotland by 2018, especially in the most deprived communities. In particular, by bringing together the research evidence on crime inequalities involving both 'people' (e.g. victims and offenders) and 'places' (e.g. crime locus and events), we have influenced innovative thinking around how policing strategies can be more accurately targeted and can have diffusion benefits. We are also influencing collaborative practice and better coordination of public service delivery across a range of agencies. 

3. Transforming stop and search policy and practice in Scotland
Susan McVie and Kath Murray of the CVS team have had significant impact in transforming policy, practice, scrutiny and legislation in relation to stop and search in Scotland. Their research has been instrumental in informing and influencing Scottish Government debate and decision making around stop and search. It has also led to greater scrutiny of Police Scotland by the Scottish Parliament Justice Committee, Scottish Police Authority and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland. They have responded to various consultations and Calls for Evidence and engaged with various organisations and political parties. In May 2015, McVie was appointed by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to the Scottish Government Independent Advisory Group on Stop and Search, which recommended to Parliament the cessation of non-statutory stop and search in Scotland and the introduction of a new Code of Practice on stop and search. McVie was also instrumental in getting political agreement to introduce regular publication and scrutiny of data on stop and search by Police Scotland. The changes to stop and search policing powers was introduced into legislation by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016 and the new Code of Practice was laid before the Scottish Parliament and gained assent in February 2017.

Overall, McVie and Murray's work has contributed to a transformation in stop and search policy and practice which has led a substantial reduction in the use of stop and search on the Scottish public (identified by the European Court of Human Rights as a human rights issue). In addition, the introduction of the Code of Practice (which McVie was involved in drafting) has led to force-wide training within Police Scotland on changes to the use of stop and search and to improve understanding of the powers of search based on reasonable suspicion. It is anticipated that this training will lead to widespread cultural change within Police Scotland on their approach to crime reduction and prevention. In addition, McVie has been given responsibility for overseeing the conduct of an official review of the implementation of the Code of Practice after 6 and 12 months, after which other changes may be introduced. More importantly, their research has led to a widespread change of opinion and dialogue within Police Scotland and Scottish Government around the use of stop and search in Scotland. McVie and Murray are currently working with Police Scotland to create a new set of Area Commander Metrics that will be used for internal monitoring and scrutiny purposes. 

4. UK Government Department for Communities and Local Government (Sheffield HQ)
In December 2016, Professor Pryce (leader of the Urban Segregation and Inequality strand) was invited to present on 'Life at the Frontier: Impacts of Frontiers in Residential Segregation' to the UK Government's Department for Communities and Local Government, drawing on AQMeN research into social frontiers and segregation. 
There is potential for impact here, if DCLG use this evidence to consider the implications of different forms of segregation, with a view to rethinking housing and community planning policies. Local authority representatives from nearby Rotherham are keen to explore ways of working with the AQMeN Urban Segregation and Inequality research team to help them understand segregation problems in their area and how to design policies to address them. Professor Pryce is in the process of following this up. 

5. Collaboration with Hebei Province 
USI Researchers at Sheffield University, including AQMeN Co-Director Professor Gwilym Pryce and AQMeN Research Associate Dr Guanpeng Dong have established a collaboration with Hebei Institute of Statistical Sciences (HISS). The purpose of this collaboration, established in January 2017, is to provide the government of Hebei Province in China with complex analysis of the spatial dynamics of poverty, pollution and health in Hebei. Dr Dong developed the HSAR (Hierarchical Spatial Autoregressive Model) R toolkit during his time with AQMeN (he has since moved on to Liverpool University but continues to work on the project) which is being utilised as part of this collaboration with Hebei. Dr Dong received the Jon Rasbash Prize for Quantitative Social Science in June 2016 for the paper Dong, G., Harris, R (2015) Spatial autoregressive models for geographically hierarchical data structures. Geographical Analysis, 47(2):173-191, which he developed further in his paper: Spatial Random Slope Multilevel Modelling using Multivariate Conditional Autoregressive Models, published in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers 106(1): 19-35 Dong, G P, Ma J, Harris R and Pryce G. (2016), which explores how to incorporate a spatial dependence effect into the standard multilevel modelling (MLM). 

Hebei province has some of the most polluted cities in the world. A key priority for the 74 million people who live there is to find ways of reducing air pollution and to address the associated social and health inequalities. The research team will begin by developing the necessary data infrastructure needed to provide the government a clear picture of how pollution, health and social deprivation are related and how they have changed over time. The potential for impact is exceptional due to: (a) the scale and importance of the problem the research team are seeking to address, and (b) access to senior policy makers made possible through collaboration with the Hebei Institute of Statistical Sciences (HISS). 

This project offers an outstanding opportunity to make a step change in the quality and richness of evidence available to decision makers in Hebei Province. The new project will give researchers an opportunity to make the statistical innovations of the AQMeN project more accessible and more widely known, including this HSAR (Hierarchical Spatial Autoregressive Model) R toolkit, and techniques for computing inference using Bayesian CAR (Conditional Auto Regressive) methods.
This is a new collaboration which was established in early 2017 and the work will begin later this year.

6. Collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Social Science
USI has also been developing links with the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS), which is essentially a think tank/research unit that provides data and analysis to inform Chinese social and economic policy. We successfully bid for an ESRC/Newton fund project to explore ways to apply the new methods developed in USI to Chinese data with a view to improving the evidence base for research on segregation and inequality in China. In July 2017 Professor Pryce and colleagues at Sheffield will be running a one day conference and 4 day summer school providing training to delegates of CASS to help pave the way for our methods being used by Chinese government researchers. 

7. Informing public debate on the Scottish Referendum
This included funding for additional sweeps of the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey, new funding for a survey of young Scots voters, and a study of the role that social media played in the independence referendum. As a whole, this research had a significant impact on policy decision making, political debate and media dissemination. The findings from the research were used widely by politicians and political commentators, and were broadcast all over the world. Findings from the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey were released through published reports and the What Scotland Thinks? Website and provided critical scrutiny of the assertions of both sides. They also gave both sides of the debate (and the media) guidance as to what the issues were about which voters felt the need to be informed. The SSA analysis, especially through John Curtice's frequent public appearances at conferences and in the news media, shaped many aspects of the debate, notably on:
? the importance of maximal devolution in people's constitutional preferences;
? predicting that the February 2013 currency intervention would not prove beneficial to the No side;
? highlighting that people like social risks such as pensions being funded out of a UK pool (this point picked up particularly in speeches and writing by Gordon Brown, MP).

Moreover, the analysis from SSAS 2013 that economics continued to remain central to voters' decisions had a clear impact on the kinds of appeals the campaigns have been making (as demonstrated by the claim that independence was worth &amp;pound;1000 per person per year and the Union was worth &amp;pound;1400), and on journalistic and public understanding of what matters in the referendum.

Rachel Ormston's prior analysis of the gender differences in support for independence were pivotal in concentrating public debate on this question; her work was presented at the August 2014 public event, and received extensive coverage in the print and broadcast media, including a high-profile live interview on the Radio 4 Today programme on the day of the conference. Jan Eichhorn's analysis of the characteristics of people who had not yet decided how to vote in the referendum was strongly influential on campaigning by both sides of the main debate.

8. Understanding the attitudes and behaviours of Young Scots voters
The referendum saw the voting age lowered to 16, enfranchising a new group of voters that never before had the chance to take part in a national vote. Because of this, most political attitudes data only contained information for respondents aged 18 or above. Polls that contained results for under-18 year olds often had too small a sub-sample to do any meaningful analyses. Therefore this project was to conduct two surveys of 14-17 year olds in Scotland, in April and May 2013 and 2014 respectively. A key aim of this project was to use the research evidence to inform the public and media to achieve wider engagement on the Referendum. Key highlights and impact from this project include:
? We took part in a wide range of public events and reached a large number of people beyond the media outputs. We provided briefings and input to researchers in both the UK and Scottish Government to support the improvement of the quality of the debate with factual evidence.
? Our work was cited by political figures in public settings (e.g. Gordon Brown: http://www.scotsman.com/news/education/gordon-brown-scots-want-uk-wide-school-system-1-3445973)
? We provided evidence to consultations relating to political engagement of young people and the discussion about lowering the voting age for: a consultation by the Scottish Government in April 2014 (&amp;quot;Scotland's electoral future&amp;quot;) and a British Youth Council Select Committee on &amp;quot;Lowering the Voting Age to 16&amp;quot;.
? Following the Referendum, Jan Eichhorn presented at a meeting of the Cross-Party Group on Youth Politics at Holyrood. Two of the three expert advisors cited our work on voting age and youth political attitudes. Other relevant organisations (including the Scottish Youth Parliament) stated that they were using our research as a source in their submissions to the Smith commission.

9. Measuring the impact of social media on opinions on and attitudes to Scottish Independence
This project was funded to carry out research into the impact that social media had on public opinion to the Scottish Independence Referendum. The project aimed to study the nature and impact of online discussion threads on attitudes to independence. In addition, additional funding was obtained through the AQMeN Collaborative Small Grants Scheme to examine Twitter content in the lead up to the referendum campaign. The main highlights and impact from this project were:
? We provided extensive and rigorously analysed evidence that, despite frequent claims in public, the online debate was on the whole being conducted fairly and with reasonable respect, though as robustly as any political debate.
? The online debate did not use evidence and there was little sign that the ideals of deliberative democracy were being achieved, despite the possibilities offered by some online forums.
? This data was influential in the political analysis of the debates and discussions taking place on social media during the course of the referendum.

10. Improving secondary school education on political science
Material from all the projects listed above was brought together to create a set of teaching materials for use in schools. These were developed in collaboration with the Scottish Modern Studies Association. Over 100 schools and numerous other organisations downloaded the materials, and many passed on the materials to colleagues in other institutions. In addition, the materials were shared with a wider UK audience by sharing best practice guidelines with the Beyond the Youth Citizenship Commission Report: Young People and Politics (Political Studies Association) and beyond the UK, by broadening the applicability and reach of the guidelines through a TedX talk (available on YouTube). Many students engaged with our materials and developed greater levels of confidence in engaging with facts and figures presented to them during, and after, the campaign.

Overall the impact from these projects was significant and generated a significant amount of media attention. There were half a million unique users recorded on the What Scotland Thinks website during September 2014, set up as part of the SSA project but used by all three to post updates on the research evidence as it emerged. There was extraordinary media attention around the debate with its figuring at or near the top of the BBC News at 10 every evening in the final week before 18 September.

11. The view from the continent: What people in other member states think about the UK's EU referendum
In 2015/16, the ESRC funded a further programme of research around the 'UK in a Changing Europe' initiative, and AQMeN was successful in bidding for funding under this programme. This project, titled 'The view from the continent: What people in other member states think about the UK's EU referendum', aimed to better understand how the governments of EU member states (MS), bearing in mind public opinion in their own countries, might respond to the UK's attempt to renegotiate the terms of its EU membership. The work was in two parts: 1) a series of surveys in different EU MS was conducted to understand public perceptions of the UK's EU referendum and to develop a better understanding of the perceived implications of the referendum for the EU and its member states; and 2) interviews were held with elites in those same countries in an attempt to better understand the role that public opinion, and the content of public opinion, plays in decision-making. This was the only ESRC funded project to examine public views in different EU member states, which will be a vitally important aspect of the negotiation process during Brexit. The study produced important insights:
? We demonstrated the strong differentiation between the UK and other member states regarding fundamental attitudes towards the EU.
? We showed a great degree of variation in different EU countries on the appraisal of current EU arrangements.
? We found little appetite for exceptionalism for the UK, but substantial support for changes at EU level that would apply to all member states.
? We demonstrated substantial interest in referenda in four out of six member states, with a varying degree of support as well as the potential for serious knock on effects from a British EU exit.

Findings from this study were disseminated widely during pre-referendum period, including: four well-attended public events in London, Edinburgh, Brussels and Berlin); events in North America at the Wilson Institute in Washington, Georgetown University, The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, McGill University and the University of Montreal. The findings also received extensive media attention, including for example coverage in The Guardian, the Independent, the BBC, the Daily Record, the Herald, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, CNN and RNE.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>81566CBB-1071-4BB6-9E44-03FE577BB897</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Details of the key findings from all three core research strands for the AQMeN grant can be found below: 

1. Crime and Victimisation 
Our research on crime, victimisation and offending has covered a broad range of topics and highlighted new and significant findings that are of both theoretical and policy relevance. In particular, we have identified increasing inequality in the experience of crime in Scotland, both in terms of people and places, over the period of the crime drop. We have conducted highly impactful research on police stop and search in Scotland.

1a. Revealing inequality and the crime drop in Scotland

Like many other European countries, Scotland saw a significant fall in crime from the early 1990s. Our research reveals significant variation by crime type in the factors that may have explained the crime drop and shows that these factors have time-varying effects which should be taken into account in any future analysis of the crime drop (Humphreys, Francis and McVie, 2014; forthcoming). Our research has also studied the crime drop across local authorities in England and Scotland. We find similar trends in the reduction of recorded burglary across Local Authorities; however, trends in violence show considerably more spatial variation. There is no pattern that distinguishes Scotland from England, however (Bates, McVie and Pillinger, forthcoming). There is little research on the crime drop at local level, so we explored trajectories of crime in Glasgow neighbourhoods over time. Despite an overall crime drop, there are marked differences in the levels and trajectories of crime for different neighbourhood groupings. Those with high or low levels of crime exhibited spatial clustering and significant distinction in their characteristics. Some areas showed limited spatial patterning, but there is still clear difference in characteristics between neighbourhoods that exhibit different crime trajectories (Bannister, Bates and Kearns 2017). 

We have also conducted innovative research to understand how the crime drop was experienced by victims. Applying latent class analysis to victim survey data from 1993 to 2010/11, we found four typical groups of people based on their likelihood of being a victim of crime. Over time, the likelihood of being a 'non-victim' increased, while the likelihood of being a 'one off property crime' or 'multiple mixed victim' reduced; whereas the risk of being a 'frequent personal victim' remained constant. We conclude that the crime drop mostly benefited those who were at least risk of victimisation, while those who were at higher risk have remained so (McVie, Norris and Pillinger, 2014; 2015; forthcoming). We also examined the crime drop from the perspective of changing patterns of offending. Using the Scottish Offenders Index, we found that the fall in crime was associated with a drop in conviction amongst young people (under age 21) but less so for older groups. We also found that changes in pattern of conviction coincided with important periods of policy change in Scotland, a factor that has not previously been studied in this area of work. (Matthews 2014; Matthews and Minton, forthcoming; Matthews, PhD thesis).

1b. Transforming policing practice in Scotland
Our research on stop and search has had a significant impact on changes in policy, practice, legislation and scrutiny around policing practice in Scotland. We revealed considerable variation in the use of stop and search across different parts of Scotland, and identified aspects of inequality in the use of police powers across different segments of the population (especially by age groups). On the basis of our research, there has been a widespread change in the use of stop and search through the cessation of consensual searching and the introduction of a new Code of Practice. Using both statistical and ethnographic methodologies, we have identified significant normative and cultural transformation in Scottish policing (McVie and Murray, forthcoming).

1c. Advancing methodological approaches within criminology
Our research applies a range of innovative new methodologies to crime data. We used latent class methods to conduct quasi-longitudinal analysis of victim survey data (McVie, Norris and Pillinger, forthcoming); we applied Latent Class Growth Analysis and Local Indicators of Spatial Association to make a unique contribution to the literature on neighbourhood effects and crime (Bannister, Bates and Kearns, 2017); and we used shaded contour plots and applied decomposition techniques to offenders index data (Matthews and Minton, forthcoming; Matthews, PhD thesis). In addition, we demonstrated the value of using B-spline smoothers as an alternative to polynomials when estimating trajectory shapes in group-based trajectory models (Francis, Elliott and Weldon 2016); we showed the limitations of using the diversity index to study offending specialisation because of its relationship with the frequency of offending (Francis and Humphreys 2016); and we compared and contrasted different mixed-effects modelling techniques to examine whether there are specific subgroups of offenders with distinct seriousness trajectory shapes (Francis and Liu 2015).
Improving understanding of the nature of offending and characteristics of offenders

Our research has studied offending and offenders in an attempt to inform better policy making on crime prevention and reduction. We conducted research to find out whether it was feasible to identify offenders who were potentially involved in organised crime from convictions data, based on three criteria associated with such crime (co-offending, commission of specific offences, and 3+ years of imprisonment). We found around 0.2 per cent of the offender population could be differentiated from general offenders on such measures as: diversity of nationality and ethnicity, onset age, offence type and criminal recidivism (Kirby, Francis, Humphreys and Soothill 2016). We also conducted a long term follow up study of 317 middle-class offenders in England and Wales to examine the risk of employing ex-offenders. While 40% were subsequently convicted, only 8% were subsequently convicted of offenses that directly and adversely affected an employer which suggests that fears about employing ex-offenders are exaggerated (Soothill, Humphreys and Francis 2013). Our research also highlighted the impact of poverty at both the individual and neighbourhood level on youth violence. Using longitudinal data from the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime, we found that poverty predicted violence even when controlling for indicators of a range of other risk and protection factors. We conclude that violence reduction strategies need to conceptualise young people involved in violence as vulnerable children rather than offenders (McAra and McVie 2016).

1d. Neighbourhood effects on offending
There is a policy of housing ex-offenders in areas with a high concentration of offenders. Therefore, we explored whether the density of prior offenders in a neighbourhood had an influence on the propensity of others to (re)commence offending. We found a positive association between the number of 'newly active' offenders in a neighbourhood and the density of prior offenders (of both violent and property crime). This suggests that intra-neighbourhood social mechanisms may influence (re)offending, so policies which concentrate offenders in particular neighbourhoods may be flawed (Livingston, Galster, Kearns and Bannister 2014). We also studied the effect of housing policies that strive to reduce crime by achieving social diversity in deprived areas. Such 'mixed communities' are thought to be more cohesive and sustainable, with reduced crime and antisocial behaviour. However, we found that although crime rates were patterned by housing tenure, the effects were not large. Local crime rates were more strongly associated with income deprivation levels and the number of alcohol outlets in an area. So although housing plays a part in influencing local crime rates, it may be more a result of sorting effects than neighbourhood effects (Livingston, Kearns and Bannister 2013).

2. Education and Social Stratification 
The ESS strand has conducted extensive research on issues of social inequalities in HE access and retention, and in graduates' labour market outcomes. Using a variety of secondary data from national and international surveys (such as the Scottish and Irish School Leavers Survey and the Reflex data) and from administrative sources (such as the Scottish Longitudinal Study and HESA data), the team produced new evidence about the mechanisms by which social inequalities are reproduced in education and the labour market. Some key research findings of this research are reported below.

2a. Curriculum choice and inequalities in HE entry
A key research focus has been the role played by secondary education curriculum choices and HE entry requirements in the reproduction of social inequalities in HE access. We examined the extent to which social inequality in HE entry is due to the subjects taken and/or the grades received at the end of upper secondary education (Iannelli, Smyth and Klein, 2015). We found that subject choice at upper secondary level explains more of the social gap in HE entry in Scotland than in Ireland while the grades achieved explain more of the social gap in Ireland than in Scotland. The comparison of the Irish and Scottish systems illustrated the unintended consequences of different choice structures and HE entry mechanisms. More flexible choice of courses in Scotland results in greater social differentiation in the number and type of subjects studied. Thus, early subject choices have longer term implications for post-school pathways, highlighting the importance of educational guidance as a channel to more equitable HE access. In contrast, in Ireland exam performance emerges as the main driver of inequality in HE entry, indicating the need to foster educational achievement among working-class young people at upper secondary level and earlier within the school system. 

2b. HE retention and WP initiatives
We further studied whether there are social differences in the chances of dropping-out of education among students enrolled in Scottish HE institutions (Kadar-Satat and Iannelli, 2016). Indeed, there is a growing recognition that widening participation in HE is not just about greater social equality in access to higher education, but also about ensuring that all students are able to successfully complete their programme of study, regardless of their background. Thanks to the Scottish Funding Council providing us with additional funding and information for identifying HE students coming from low progression schools and more or less deprived areas of Scotland in our data, we were able to provide new evidence on issues of student retention in Scottish HE institutions. In particular, the study analysed non-continuation rates of students from schools which were involved in the SFC-funded Schools for Higher Education Programme (SHEP) and students 'articulating' from Colleges to HE institutions. Our findings showed that students from SHEP schools do not appear to be at significantly higher risk of dropping out than the other students participating in HE. However, articulating students were found to be more likely than other students to drop out from HE before completing their degree studies. The final report made a series of recommendations for policy and future research which were shared with the SFC, practitioners from the school and the university sector, and the Commission on Widening Access (COWA). 

2c. Social inequalities in fields of study
In this research we assessed the extent to which fields of study and postsecondary institutional sectors serve as mechanisms to preserve social stratification in Scottish higher education (Iannelli, Gamoran and Paterson, 2016). We developed a hierarchy of fields of study based on their occupational and income returns, avoiding problems of circularity that occur when fields of study are ranked by their selectivity. We combined data from representative surveys from six cohorts of Scottish school leavers with data from labor force surveys and higher education statistics to examine patterns of inequality in fields of study overall, and within types of Scottish higher education, from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The results indicate that fields of study are not stratified by social origins. Indeed, within the newer sectors of Scottish postsecondary education we see evidence of persons from less advantaged backgrounds choosing more lucrative fields of study: students from intermediate and working class origins tend to be overrepresented in high-return fields of study in Scotland's higher education colleges (upgraded to university status as part of the expansion that took place in the early 1990s) which, though less prestigious than the old, established universities, are venues in which programs such as engineering, technology, business, and allied health fields - among the more remunerative fields - are concentrated. Although fields of study do not stratify students by social origins, they do magnify gender inequality, as men are overrepresented and women are underrepresented in fields with greater labor market returns. This finding highlights that the major hurdle for people from more disadvantaged social backgrounds in Scotland is to gain access to most selective universities.

2d. Social inequalities in graduates' destinations
In other work we compared the UK and Germany to examine the role that national institutional systems have in shaping individuals' transition from higher education to the labour market (Jacob, Klein and Iannelli, 2015). In Germany a much smaller share of students attains a higher education degree than in the UK, but linkages between higher education and occupational destinations are much stronger than in the UK. These aspects differently shape the transition of graduates into the labour market in the two countries and affect the extent to which family background characteristics play a role in graduates' job opportunities. Our results indicate that in the UK graduates' family background factors play a stronger role in job allocation than in Germany. We concluded that the expansion of the HE system in the UK has opened up opportunities to gain a degree to people previously excluded but risks being ineffective in promoting social mobility if labour market opportunities are still biased towards the most advantaged social groups. 

2e. Education, civic values and civic participation
Using a wide range of survey evidence from Britain, this work shows that education really is important democratically. Higher education does make people more liberal, more politically optimistic and more inclined to participate in society. Moreover, the kind of curriculum followed matters too. Academic education - especially in the humanities and social sciences - has stronger civic effects than vocational education. Thus the findings of this research show that academic higher education makes people less politically cynical, induces them to be more to the right politically, and inclines them to join organisations. In all these respects, the effect of vocational education is much weaker. This work demonstrates that civic life benefits from citizens who have learned, through education, to think independently.

8. Evidence of a house price premium for energy efficient homes
9. Social frontiers associated with higher crime
10. Evidence of &amp;quot;White flight&amp;quot; using innovative name-based ethnicity measures</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. We anticipate that other academics will be able to use our findings in their own research (and replicate areas of our work by using new datasets and syntax that we will deposit at the end of the project). In particular, the new methodologies and analytical toolkits that we have developed can be used by other academics to extend data analyses in other disciplinary areas of research. Our research has produced exciting and novel findings relating to inequality across a range of domains (crime, education, housing, urban development, etc) and this will be of value to a plethora of academics working in these areas.
2. We already know that politicians, policy makers, practitioners and third party organisations are interested in using our findings for a range of uses (as reported in the Impact Narrative and under 'Influence on Policy, Practice etc'. Our research has so far been used to: change policies and practice around widening participation to higher education; to transform policing practices and introduce new legislation and guidance on stop and search; to inform the development of new crime prevention and reduction strategies aimed at building safer communities; and to develop international collaboration with Chinese policy makers who are interested in applying our methodologies to applied policy problems (such as pollution, transport and crime) in Hebei.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD47263A-F233-4FD8-8787-40D9200B054E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.aqmen.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Co-author of the Report of the Independent Advisory Group on Stop and Search</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1F3E5377-A5F9-4D1D-A7B0-62FD4ACDB800</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Susan McVie was appointed by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice as a member of the Scottish Government's Advisory Group on Stop and Search in May 2015. She was one of the co-authors of the official report of the Advisory Group on Stop and Search delivered to the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in August 2015. Amongst the recommendations were that a Code of Practice should be introduced through statute to govern the use of stop and search in Scotland and that the use of non-statutory (or consensual) stop and search should end. McVie was directly responsible for the inclusion of a recommendation that data on all recorded stops and searches should be released on a regular basis for the purposes of evaluating and monitoring the use of the practice through increased public scrutiny. The Cabinet Secretary agreed to all of the report recommendations and the amendments to police powers of search were legislated in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2016/1/section/65/enacted</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submission to Scottish Government Call for Evidence on the Commission on Widening Access</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC0AD397-1040-42F0-AC08-B4FC04EC1AF3</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://media.wix.com/ugd/785ba4_c19b9935bc64440bbb5b3abb22fd5da6.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training for Police Scotland Intelligence Analysts</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B21C61B1-0A37-4A10-BE28-F97C077953CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The AQMeN Crime and Victimisation Team have been involved in delivering training for Scottish police crime analysts. This started with an initial training session titled @Introduction to statistical modelling for qualitative researchers' run as a bespoke event for police crime analysts and researchers who were interested in learning about statistical modelling (28.2.14). Funding was then secured to run a series of bespoke training events for Police Scotland to train their analysts in using and modelling crime data. Three follow up training events were held in November 2014, January 2015 and December 2015. These events provided detailed training on the analysis of crime data, and in particular on the way in which data on stop and search could be analysed to better understand trends and patterns. A bespoke training manual was produced for Police Scotland, and this was also turned into a blueprint report for police officers on how to interpret and understand crime data.

It sets out a comprehensive set of principles on which stop and search should be carried out, and clarifies aspects of practice in regards to the conduct of stop and search in Scotland. Significantly, the new Code of Practice goes beyond similar documents in other jurisdictions by containing detailed guidance on the use of stop and search for children and young people, which are based on human rights principles and underpinned by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Scottish Government's Getting It Right for Every Child approach. The Code also contains detailed guidance on dealing with vulnerable adults.

The consultation was launched because the Independent Advisory Group on Stop and Search was unable to reach a consensus on whether there should be a new statutory power to stop and search children for alcohol, and recommended further consultation on this
matter. The consultation sought views on the option of introducing statutory powers to stop and search children for alcohol, or those suspected of supplying children with alcohol. 
The AQMeN Crime and Victimisation Team took part in the consultation and submitted a report providing extensive data and analysis on underage drinking trends in Scotland, and on how police officers use their powers of stop and search, and seizure in relation to underage drinking. The report concluded that there was insufficient evidence to warrant the extension of police powers to search children and young people for alcohol and recommended that a period of further assessment was required before this could take place. The official report of the consultation makes reference to the report in its deliberations, and the recommendation of the report was accepted by the Scottish Government. No power to search children and young people for alcohol was introduced, and the policy is under review.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gov.scot/Resource/0050/00509077.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>AQMeN report - Beyond Access to HE: Widening Access Initiatives and Student Retention in Scotland - used in Scottish Funding Council Triennial Review published in May 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19A5B9C2-4012-4A55-AFC3-BCF99BDF6A4B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sfc.ac.uk/web/FILES/CMP_AccessandInclusionCommittee24May2016_24052016/AIC16_13_Triennial_review.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Building Safer Communities Programme Board (Performance Champion)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6454017-74F8-48AD-8C76-F25A6B15252F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2013 Professor Susan McVie was appointed to the Scottish Government's Building Safer Communities Programme Board (BSCPB) to advise on the development of policy and practice around community safety and reducing victimisation in Scotland.

The tool-kit has been included as part of a collaboration with AQMeN researchers at Sheffield University and the government of Hebei Province in China to analyse the spatial dynamics of poverty, pollution and health in Hebei.. Hebei province has some of the most polluted cities in the world. A key priority for the 74 million people who live there is to
find ways of reducing air pollution and to address the associated social and health inequalities. It is crucial that the true cost of pollution is included in economic planning. The first step is to develop the necessary data infrastructure needed to provide the government a clear picture of how pollution, health and social deprivation are related and how they have
changed over time. The potential for impact is exceptional due to: (a) the scale and importance of the problem we are seeking to address, and (b) access to senior policy makers made possible through collaboration with the Hebei Institute of Statistical Sciences (HISS). This project offers an outstanding opportunity to make a step change in the quality and richness of evidence available to decision makers in Hebei Province. The new project will give researchers an opportunity to make the statistical innovations of the AQMeN project more accessible and more widely known, including this HSAR (Hierarchical Spatial Autoregressive Model) R toolkit , and techniques for computing inference using Bayesian
CAR (Conditional Auto Regressive) methods.

This is a new collaboration which was established in early 2017 and the work will begin later this year.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>HSAR (Hierarchical Spatial Autoregressive Model) R toolkit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HSAR/index.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/88F4F58B-F14B-4D7A-A042-01F2851F6255"><gtr:id>88F4F58B-F14B-4D7A-A042-01F2851F6255</gtr:id><gtr:title>Painting by numbers: The changing landscape of crime in Scotland</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ff986b4f979613ec7e1cc708e20fec08"><gtr:id>ff986b4f979613ec7e1cc708e20fec08</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McVie, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/181F5BDD-3A71-4AEF-B60D-5948BEFCEDF7"><gtr:id>181F5BDD-3A71-4AEF-B60D-5948BEFCEDF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Viktimisierungsbefragungen in Deutschland - Band 2: Methodik und Methodologie.
