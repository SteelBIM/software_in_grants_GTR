It contrasts these approaches with those promoted by Russia and China, both bilaterally and through regional organisations, and looks at the effects of these on national conflict management strategies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project?s case studies are three significant outbreaks of violence in recent years:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Khorog, Tajikistan, 2012&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Rasht valley, Tajikistan, 2010-11&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Osh, Kyrgyzstan, 2010.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project team will conduct interviews in London, Beijing and Moscow with policymakers, academics and NGOs, to assess the ways in which policymakers framed and understood these conflict situations. Fieldwork in Central Asia will assess societal and state practices of conflict management which may diverge from those prescribed in Western approaches.&amp;nbsp; The research seeks to improve our understandings of such divergent approaches to conflict management with the aim of more effective responses to conflict in the region, in the context of emerging relations between Rising Powers and the West. Furthermore it will explore the effects of conflict management on the formation of states in Post-Soviet Central Asia.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Importance

This research project is designed to have a significant impact on policy discussions and outcomes, both in the UK and internationally. The project's engagement with the role of 'Rising Powers' in global governance and conflict management has implications for broader international policy concerns, beyond the case-study region of Central Asia. 

2. Significance for UK foreign and development policies

The project is particularly relevant for UK and other EU government and non-government bodies engaged in conflict resolution and prevention. The UK government has taken a lead internationally on new approaches to conflict resolution, both directly and through funding UK-based NGOs. This project will encourage an informed discussion to emerge with Russian, Chinese and Central Asian actors about divergent approaches to conflict, attempting to improve mutual understanding of different approaches to preventing and responding to conflict in a region of potential strategic competition. 

3. Impact built into research design

Impact will be integral to the design of the project and should be ensured by the participation as co-investigator of the NGO, Saferworld. An initial workshop in the UK at the beginning of the project, involving key individuals in UK government bodies and UK-based NGOs engaged with conflict issues, will be used to focus and refine the project's methods for achieving impact. Representatives from the UK Government, British-based NGOs, EU institutions, other national development agencies, foreign ministries and international NGOs, will be engaged through workshops and in the process of research in the Central Asian states. 

4. Ongoing involvement of policy actors

To maintain engagement with policy-makers throughout the project, we will invite several representatives of the policy community to be members of an International Advisory Board (IAB) that would exist during the project's duration. The IAB will include at least one representative from Russia, China and Central Asia, in addition to UK government and non-government representation. 

5. Impact on rising powers and Central Asia

Initial engagement with UK and EU actors will be accompanied by early engagement with partners in China and Russia, building on existing links and also developing new channels for dialogue. Two workshops are built into the design of the project in each of Beijing and Moscow during the course of the project, in partnership with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (Beijing), the School of Political Science of Tongji University (Shanghai) and the Russian Academy of Sciences (Moscow), and overseen by Saferworld, which already has significant involvement in both countries. We will engage with both government and non-government representatives in both countries at these events. 
The project will focus particular attention on local stakeholders, including government and non-government actors and local communities in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. We will ensure that the concept of the project and its outputs are disseminated locally to interested parties through workshops in the region. We will also engage with diplomatic representatives of the three countries in the UK. Attention will be paid to the potential political sensitivities of the project, but we will also seek robust engagement with policymakers and academics from all countries in these fields. 

6. Outputs for impact

In addition to academic outputs, we will produce briefing documents and policy papers aimed at a non-academic audience, to summarise the policy implications of the project. These will be presented at final workshops in UK, Russia, China and Central Asia, and distributed on a dedicated website, which will be updated regularly. The Saferworld report on China and conflict management in Central Asia will be published in three languages, and launched at Beijing, London and Moscow workshops</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>483080</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9663</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>International responses to violence in the South of Kyrgyzstan, June 2010</gtr:description><gtr:end>2014-05-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Open Society Foundation, New York</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>E5FA5DCF-20BD-46A2-A84C-71047F2D5854</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>9914</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>University of Exeter, Humanities and Social Sciences Strategy, project grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Exeter</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>F6550CFB-9196-48FC-AF8C-AFA9532107D5</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Conflict management in Central Asia during the period of research, 2005-2015, was dominated by local and state approaches which themselves reflect the consolidation of authoritarian regimes.

Research in Uzbekistan showed that the government avoided ethnic-based conflict spilling over from Kyrgyzstan in 2010 by the rapid and forceful control of space and discourse. The state flooded minority Kyrgyz villages with security forces to prevent attacks on them, and tightly controlled information on the violence in Kyrgyzstan and public discussion of it in Uzbekistan. In Tajikistan, the conflicts themselves resemble purges within the state rather than rebellions against the state. 

2. Where an institutionally and resource-weak central state is unable to contain conflict, powerful local actors with strong client support networks may intervene to intervene to prevent or de-escalate conflict.

In southern Kyrgyzstan, local elites were able to prevent violence from spreading to some towns due to their inter-ethnic ties. In the city of Osh in that region, the mayor developed his own distinct approach to conflict management, independent of the national government, for a period of time. Vernacular discourses of conflict management profess concepts of peace which are distinct from those of the authoritarian state. 

3. External actors - both Western and rising powers - have not been directly involved in conflict management and have uncertain indirect effects on local and state patterns.

Further analysis and research is required to assess the importance of the post-colonial context in explaining variation in the roles of Russia and China in post-Soviet Central Asia. Our project was effective at establishing a new network of connections between Central Asian Studies in China and the UK, particularly between Exeter, Saferworld and Chatham House's Eurasia programme and East China Normal University and the Shanghai Institutes of International Studies in China. In Russia, merely conducting a workshop and keeping channels open given the downturn in relations with the West and academic openness was an achievement. 

4. 'Peace' is a contested term deployed and used very differently by different actors for different ends.

Different actors - central and local governments, ethnically-based communities, international organisations, and foreign governments - used different ways to speak about 'peace.' Although these bore some resemblance, in practice they were freighted with very different visions of how social difference should be accommodated and expressed in public space, and how power should be exercised. A concept of 'authoritarian conflict management' has been defined with economic, spatial and discursive dimension for further investigation in multi-methods, cross-regional and inter-disciplinary projects.

5. The evaluation of fieldwork via ethics procedures used in UK academia, often derived from medical school models, may only poorly approximate the challenges faced.

Research in Tajikistan was abandoned and in southern Kyrgyzstan it was paused on two occasions due to the closing down of the space for fieldwork. In June 2014, one of our contracted researchers in Tajikistan was arrested and detained on charges of espionage for 36 days. Our research team became the object of the authoritarian state's conflict management strategy as it sought to control all information produced about the conflict in question. We learnt a great deal about the ethical dilemmas of research. The PI subsequently chaired a taskforce of the Central Eurasian Studies Society (USA) which reported on the changing risks of fieldwork in the region in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The team is committed to furthering research through partnerships with scholars working on other methods (particularly quantitative social scientists working on large datasets in conflict studies, including a group at the University of Exeter), in other regions (particularly the Middle East and North Africa, but also other adjacent regions of Eurasia and South Asia where authoritarian methods have been prominent) and with other disciplines (including historians and area studies scholars of other regions). These three types of scholars are included in new research funding bids aimed at expanding the general validity and audience for findings. 

In addition, our partnership with Saferworld has been successful in pioneering long-term, project-based cooperation between the organization and academics. Our papers on their website have high download statistics. In total, 40,000 downloads took place of papers in English, Russian and Chinese in the period from 2013-2016. Chatham House were also involved in the project throughout and hosted a total of four project-linked events over the four years of the programme. In 2014-15, the Heathershaw/Montgomery report on radicalization was the third-most downloaded paper on the Chatham House website. These figures show that our research is being used by others, probably in a huge variety of ways.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0DF54A45-6677-4470-8D70-3D5F53783C3D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/excas/country-research/carp/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/92E5F8CA-9614-4579-99B5-E1C44185889F"><gtr:id>92E5F8CA-9614-4579-99B5-E1C44185889F</gtr:id><gtr:title>The affective politics of sovereignty: reflecting on the 2010 conflict in Kyrgyzstan</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nationalities Papers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/37e9d4841d46b738271bc9c465cb2f8f"><gtr:id>37e9d4841d46b738271bc9c465cb2f8f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gullette D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A67868FF-9A0D-467C-9AAD-A1CFC4E04E4B"><gtr:id>A67868FF-9A0D-467C-9AAD-A1CFC4E04E4B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Blogging Zhanaozen: hegemonic discourse and authoritarian resilience in Kazakhstan</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Central Asian Survey</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3f4cd2d1e64a2ab062b297b332b09cae"><gtr:id>3f4cd2d1e64a2ab062b297b332b09cae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lewis D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/21B7F222-F752-42E5-A273-B19DBAFD3858"><gtr:id>21B7F222-F752-42E5-A273-B19DBAFD3858</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mediating the Conflict in the Rasht Valley, Tajikistan</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Central Asian Affairs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/971a5bb09540a29193ce2066889f2e47"><gtr:id>971a5bb09540a29193ce2066889f2e47</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lemon E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1CC0834F-BDE7-4C15-A718-11600DE6EF75"><gtr:id>1CC0834F-BDE7-4C15-A718-11600DE6EF75</gtr:id><gtr:title>Peacebuilding and Reconciliation Projects in Southern Kyrgyzstan</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/af2129a0c3a061eb2a77145f972579d4"><gtr:id>af2129a0c3a061eb2a77145f972579d4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Megoran, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D3329FFE-8D0E-4FB3-88BB-360866069AD7"><gtr:id>D3329FFE-8D0E-4FB3-88BB-360866069AD7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bottom-up peacekeeping in Southern Kyrgyzstan: How local actors managed to prevent the spread of violence from Osh/Jalal-Abad to Aravan, June 2010</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nationalities Papers</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/63c60420f5c9d5711a2f0aefa1b8b52b"><gtr:id>63c60420f5c9d5711a2f0aefa1b8b52b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Khamidov A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7D9B5FFD-F5C6-40EE-B641-AA02BE98BEC8"><gtr:id>7D9B5FFD-F5C6-40EE-B641-AA02BE98BEC8</gtr:id><gtr:title>Reasserting Hegemony in Central Asia: Russian Policy in Kyrgyzstan after 2010</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Comillas Journal of International Relations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/71704190b708b45b4417f29b16c85855"><gtr:id>71704190b708b45b4417f29b16c85855</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lewis D.
