It is believed that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will play a critical role in the energy systems of the future, in part to support the decarbonisation objective and in part to provide grid flexibility in a future system including a large fraction of less responsive low carbon energy systems (e.g. nuclear baseload and intermittent wind). The whole systems modelling and analysis programme proposed here is designed to support wider UK initiatives by reducing technological risk and identifying performance bottlenecks. CCS will require substantial capital investment in capture and transport systems and storage complex management. Although elements of the whole chain have been studied through modelling and experimentation, there is little work on whole system assessment. For complex systems such as CCS, whole system assessment is vital ahead of large scale deployment as it identifies critical integration and interaction issues between the components and evaluates whole system performance as a function of component design parameters. Thus the whole system may be optimised; simply optimising the design of individual components is likely to result in a sub-optimal system design. The proposed research methodology is based on multiscale modelling. This involves the development of fit-for-purpose models of the individual components which describe phenomena that operate over different length and time scales and which support integration and data exchange across scales. The reason for this is that relatively localised phenomena (e.g. mass transfer in an amine scrubber) might affect the overall system transient response by limiting the rate at which the power plant flue gas flowrate can be turned up or down. Similarly, the important performance trade-offs in individual component designs must be characterised and used for overall system design. There are a number of important issues to be resolved regarding future CCS systems; the applicants believe that multiscale systems modelling approach is ideal to develop relevant insights and guidance. Examples of the issues to be addressed through whole systems modelling, analysis and optimisation include: - The development and application of a methodology to optimise the time-phased evolution of the whole CCS system design (incorporating its important individual components), including sources to recruit and location of storage sites, balancing long-term and short-term investment imperatives. - Performing integrated assessments of alternative CCS systems, through the application of fit-for-purpose models (e.g. those able to quantify trace emissions of harmful substances) and rigorous life-cycle based analyses. - Characterising the transient performance of the integrated system (how will it perform in actual operation?), understanding whether or not it affects the flexibility of the wider energy system with which it is interfaced, what the safety critical components are and the network's dynamic stability and operability bottlenecks - Understand issues of systems integration - how do the different phenomena associated with the different components in the system cause effects to propagate through the network (e.g. the effect of impurities in captured CO2, the transport network and the storage complex). What are the important considerations that must be taken into consideration when designing and operating the whole system? The outcome of the programme will be relevant to a very wide range of stakeholders interested in CCS, including industry, regulatory and policy agencies and academia. The most important contributions of the project will be: - making available methodologies to design and analyse future CCS systems - generating insights into the most important interactions involved in system design and operation - quantifying (economics, environmental impact, safety &amp;amp; operability) the performance of UK CCS systems</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>136234</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Grid Transco</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CO2 Pipeline Transport - Case study for the Humber Region in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:id>A50EC583-33D5-41F6-BE0C-1733616E2F92</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three technical reports have been circulated which provided technical predictions.

Pipelines are considered the preferred method for both onshore and offshore large volumes of CO2 transported. In the Humber region in the UK, there are two advanced proposals for CCS power station developments: the Don Valley project and the White Rose (Drax) CCS project, which were expected to provide a basis to develop a pipeline supporting a CCS cluster in this area. 
We carried out a case study of the pipeline network for the Don Valley and the White Rose CCS projects, representing the possibilities in the Humber area. A model of the pipeline network was developed using the computer software package Aspen HYSYS&amp;reg; and three different operating strategies were compared and discussed regarding their energy and utilities requirement. For all three operating strategies, simulation results show that energy consumption ranges from 96 to 103 kWh/t-CO2 and cooling duty range from about 140 to 147 Mcal/t-CO2 in a wide range of the flow rate of the CO2-rich stream.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Seminar at South East University, China on CCS and Future Research Directions - April 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D4962F28-667F-4ABB-9C4D-E9F41D771F65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited by Prof Chuanlong XU and Prof Jianhong LU at School of Energy and Environment Engineering, SouthEast University.

(1) The first finding on applying process intensification into post-combustion capture has been invited to present in UKCCSRC Biannual Meeting in April 2014 (held at University of Cambridge). This attracted strong interest from Alstom Power UK, E.ON UK and PSE Ltd. With their support, a new EPSRC grant has started for systematic research in intensified carbon capture. 

(2) The third finding on carbon transport was obtained from collaborative study with National Grid UK. This has been used directly by the company. The paper was published in Applied Energy - a leading international journal. 

(2) The third finding on carbon transport (Lazic et al., 2014) was awarded SAGE Best Paper Prize 2014 and Ludwig Mond Prize 2014 by IMechE.

(1) Preliminary study by application of process intensification technology into post-combustion carbon capture with solvents indicates that this is a promising future research direction. A steady state model for intensified absorber using rotating packed bed (RPB) was developed and validated with experimental data from literature. The study indicates that mass transfer rates can be improved significantly and the absorber size can reduce to about 8% of its original size. 

(2) Steady state modelling of chemical looping combustion with carbon capture has been studied. It indicates that the thermal efficiency of power plant with carbon capture can be improved significantly. Detailed study of fluid mechanics inside two reactors are very important. 

(3) Study in carbon transport through pipelines on estimating of capital and operating costs based on steady state model developed. Several different correlations on predicting pipeline diameter and pressure drop have been compared quantitatively and the best (or most reliable) method pointed out. Working with National Grid UK, we studied a specific case on CO2 transport through pipeline in the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These three key findings have been presented in 3 different international conferences.
