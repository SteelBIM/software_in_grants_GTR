However, despite billions invested in rural handpumps one in three handpumps do not work in rural Africa. This represents a huge wasted investment and is associated with high but avoidable health, welfare and livelihood costs. Encouragingly, the risk of handpump breakdown bears all the hallmarks of an insurable risk.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A recent technological breakthrough by researchers at Oxford University makes an insurance model now feasible. Like any insurance model premiums are lower with more handpumps as they spread the risk across all users. What is not clear is how much users would pay and what level of maintenance service they would want. Linking consumer demand with insurance supply will then provide a credible basis to test such a new handpump insurance product in the next phase of the research. There is a lot of excitement and interest in the research with the project partners including the Government of Kenya, United Nations Children Foundation (UNICEF) and mobile phone companies and operators (GSMA). If this project is successful it could help the 276 million rural Africans access safe and reliable water to make their lives and futures healthy and wealthier. That would be good news for everyone.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our pathway to impact recognizes the inherent risks and attempt to address them in a structured and explicit fashion. First, unless an insurance mechanism is socially and culturally acceptable it will fail regardless of any actuarial wizardry. Our work builds on earlier social choice experiments in Mozambique, South Africa, Senegal and Kenya to listen to the voices of the poor using pictorial trade-off cards that can then be modeled in discrete choice models. This has proven highly effective in all previous work. Second, to achieve enduring impacts we need partners like UNICEF and GSMA with the knowledge and the mandate to drive changes at scale. Third, we aim to develop an objective and rigorous evidential platform to allow policy-makers to make justifiable decisions to shift from tired, failing but safe options. By providing new evidence and insights this project will not only challenge accepted thinking about the way rural water services are managed and financed, but could also stimulate entirely new sustainable, scalable and market-based business service delivery models.

Primary beneficiaries of this pioneering research will include (a) rural water users, particularly women and children; (b) local entrepreneurs and enterprises; and (c) governments and donors/investors.

First, it is low-income water users who suffer most from the inability to manage the financial risk inherent in community managed handpump supplies. Rural water users currently lack any mechanism to share or transfer the risk of a handpump breakdown of an unpredictable size at an unforeseen time. Though they are least able to manage risk, it is women (through lengthier collection times) and young children (through diarrhoeal diseases) who bear the brunt of having to resort to unsafe alternatives when pumps breakdown. Handpump insurance could enable water users to manage this risk by ensuring sufficient financing is always available for prompt repairs when breakdown occurs. With more than one billion rural dwellers in the developing world sourcing water from boreholes or shallow wells, the potential developmental impact of this initiative is significant.

By catalyzing the creation of a handpump insurance market, the research could prove beneficial to enterprises and entrepreneurs involved in both insurance and handpump maintenance services. Even where insurers are national or multinational in scale, the delivery channel is likely to be provided by local entities and enterprises. Increases in financing available for repair activities will boost the commercial viability of a handpump maintenance business for small scale entrepreneurs. 

Governments and donors also have much to gain from an insurance mechanism that improves the financial sustainability of these systems. By increasing the functionality rates of handpump supplies, insurance models will mean governments and donors will yield a significantly greater return on their investments. The research will chart a pathway to enable governments to broaden their policy ambit beyond community management when framing rural water strategies and programmes.

Our results will be disseminated via academic papers, briefing notes and our website (oxwater.co.uk), and an electronic newsletter sent to our mailing list. This will provide a platform to communicate our findings to a large audience - in 2012 our website has received more than 10,500 page visits from 99 countries (including 20 Sub-Saharan African countries). Our work has been featured on BBC television, radio and on-line, plus numerous articles in African newspapers and online media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85519</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UNICEF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rural Water Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:id>ECFF97D5-4F6C-4A1A-A0F7-4229BACD05CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Links to wider regional initiatives in East and Southern Africa</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Expands scale of existing work with new research programme</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Technical session at World Water Week in Stockholm on 25 August 2015 on Sustainable Finance for Universal Rural Water Services</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1EB12FD4-15CF-4FBD-BBF5-E967D55A0188</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Session convened leading global practitioners advancing global goals of universal water services, including UNICEF regional office for East/Southern Africa (21 countries), GSMA (global mobile trade body), Government of Kenya and Government of Rwanda.

Analysis of survey responses from more than 3000 rural households and financial records from 100 communities generated several novel insights into the possibilities and pitfalls of rural waterpoint insurance, an as yet untested concept in sub-Saharan Africa. 

The findings reveal compelling evidence that under the prevailing community-management approach, financial risk undermines the sustainable operation and maintenance of waterpoints. Around two-third of water users cited financial challenges as the main reason why their waterpoints are not repaired, and there was a statistically significant relationship between repair cost and system downtime.

Critically, the research demonstrates that financial risk would be considerably reduced if maintenance funds could be pooled across multiple waterpoints. Financial analysis highlights the variable and unpredictable nature of waterpoint repair costs, which results in 1 in 3 repairs exceeding the 'average' cost. Under a business-as-usual approach, communities would need to add a risk loading of 230% on to an average lifecycle cost tariff, in order to accommodate the 95th percentile repair cost. Actuarial modelling suggests pooling finances across 100 handpumps would reduce the required risk loading to just 20%. In other words, pooling maintenance funds across many communities would decrease the likelihood of a shortfall to pay for high cost-low frequency repairs.

However, there are several obstacles that would likely thwart the viability of a standalone rural waterpoint insurance product. Survey results showed levels of uptake and awareness of insurance products remain extremely low, especially among low-income households. Moral hazard, adverse selections and fraud present further stumbling blocks. Hence, a more viable prospect is likely to be an insurance-style financing mechanism that pools funds and spreads risk coupled with a high quality supra-community maintenance service. That is, the insurer doubles as the maintenance service provider. Promisingly, choice experiment results indicate households in Kwale would be willing to pay US $0.58-1.16 per month to access such a service, so long as waterpoints were repaired within 2 days of breakdown. Field trials of this concept are now needed to shed light on whether it offers a feasible, sustainable and scalable solution.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The results provide instructive guidance for policy makers and practitioners looking to revise and rework approaches for the delivery of sustainable rural water services in Kenya and beyond. By characterising financial risk and its operational implications, the research lays out the case to drive reform and nurture business model innovation within the rural water sector, and inform the design of new approaches that effectively address financial risk. Governments and non-government organisations will likely be the enablers of the innovation resulting from this work. However, it is private enterprise who will most likely operationalise these business models.

The findings are of interest and relevance to multiple actors involved in rural water service delivery, including governments (national ministries; local government); water service regulators; rural water enterprises and entrepreneurs; microinsurance firms; non-government organisations; and multilaterals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C51C2804-4E78-4792-AB2A-2336FE2C927C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/research-programmes/water-programme/research.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Government of Kenya Water Services Regulatory Annual Report 2014</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6AD722B-3589-4138-BBEB-B739BCD0F9A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New model for rural water sustainability that benefits low-income and marginalised rural populations in Kenya gain more reliable water services.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wasreb.go.ke/impact-reports</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Article in The Economist (4 March 2017) on FundiFix model</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5699D385-80C6-4AE5-A829-CB5AA982D44D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21717766-innovative-cure-broken-pumps-better-way-provide-drinking-water</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21717766-innovative-cure-broken-pumps-better-way-provide-drinking-water</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DB7A81B9-36FB-4294-AD42-4E2FB37A52C2"><gtr:id>DB7A81B9-36FB-4294-AD42-4E2FB37A52C2</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pump-Priming Payments for Sustainable Water Services in Rural Africa</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>World Development</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bbac6b034c2024738c367d965831104c"><gtr:id>bbac6b034c2024738c367d965831104c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Koehler J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E2BC777F-51DA-4D04-A711-A7A6945AD006"><gtr:id>E2BC777F-51DA-4D04-A711-A7A6945AD006</gtr:id><gtr:title>Predictors of sustainability for community-managed handpumps in sub-Saharan Africa: evidence from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environmental science &amp; technology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8970328320af04cf0be0114b44c256c4"><gtr:id>8970328320af04cf0be0114b44c256c4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Foster T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0013-936X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0C975CE7-9474-4D24-A06A-B544D9F9B9E4"><gtr:id>0C975CE7-9474-4D24-A06A-B544D9F9B9E4</gtr:id><gtr:title>Risks and responses to universal drinking water security.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions.
