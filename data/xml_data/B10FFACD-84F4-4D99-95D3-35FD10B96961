While at Cardiff University there is growing interest in this cross-disciplinary research, an organised mechanism is missing to create awareness of the available expertise, to connect researchers from physics and the life sciences both within UK and internationally, and to initiate new cross-disciplinary research.I propose to make use of the C-DIP fund to overcome this shortfall and support organised activities which will promote and stimulate cross-disciplinary research at the physics-life science interface at Cardiff University and in the wider scientific community. These activities will comprise:i) a series of one-day topical meetings held at Cardiff University covering research subjects at the physics-life science interfaceii) a mini-symposium to provide a forum in which leading scientists and early-career researchers can meet and interactiii) visits from/to outstanding overseas scientists working at the physics-life sciences interface iv) seed corn funding to complete a piece of research or to carry out initial research at the physics-life sciences interface.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this programme? The networking activities supported by this Cross-Disciplinary Interfaces Programme Fellowship Fund will provide an organised mechanism to promote and stimulate cross-disciplinary research at the physics-life science interface at Cardiff University and in the wider scientific community. Researchers from physics and the life sciences within UK and internationally will greatly benefit from this support. Although the networking activities are primarily targeted to the academic community, the planed one-day workshop series a the physics-life sciences interface will be open to the industrial sector through invited speakers from companies working in e.g. physics-based technologies applied to biomedicine. How will they benefit from this research? The contribution of this programme to these beneficiaries will be mainly through: - Knowledge: via the dissemination at the symposium and workshop topical meetings of cutting edge scientific achievements and latest advances, and via the scientific outputs which will be enabled by the seed corn funding to complete a piece of research or to carry out initial research at the physics-life sciences interface. - People: The visit fund for distinguished cross-disciplinary researchers will support outstanding overseas scientists working at the physics-life sciences interface to visit a research group at Cardiff University or researchers from Cardiff to visit distinguished cross-disciplinary overseas research groups. Moreover, the mini-symposium will provide a forum in which leading scientists and early-career researchers will meet and interact. By creating such a forum, the early-career scientists will be encouraged to explore new cross-disciplinary directions and make contacts that will help them push forward the frontiers of cross-disciplinary science at the physics-life sciences interface. What will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research? As EPSRC cross-disciplinary leadership fellow I will lead the organization of these events and activities. An Advisory Board will be formed comprising national and international distinguished researchers to help and advice in the selection of invited speakers and in the overall organization of the activities. Cross-School calls for applications to the Distinguished Researcher Visit Fund and the Seed Corn Funding will be announced within Cardiff University and funding decisions will be taken by a Committee chaired by myself, with members from the Research Committees in the Schools of Physics and Biosciences. Specialised staff has also been appointed in the School of Biosciences as Innovation and Engagement Officers with whom I will liaise to engage with industry and the wider public.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77905</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BioNanoPhotonics Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4D8621C-EE7C-44E9-9A6C-20F2B65DF39C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a scientific symposium that I organise every two years, with international invited speakers and participation from industry and postgraduate students.

Also of interest of is that a bright PhD student supported by this award has just been appointed by a firm as a patent attorney. This shows that the research training he has received has stimulated his interest in innovation and business and has resulted in a professional career path which is key to scientific entrepreneurship.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C98B14B8-76D2-4965-A858-BC83AB3589C8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant was in support of cross-disciplinary research at the Physics Life Science interface within a collaborative network linked to Prof Borri Leadership Fellowship. The funds were used on several projects, including supporting the research of a cohort of PhD students in Bioimaging. The funds were also used to run a series of scientific symposia in BioNanoPhotonics at Cardiff University, and to support research exchange trough visits.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In terms of scientific outputs, this grant supported the research of a number of PhD students in Bioimaging covering areas from novel technology developments in optical micro-spectroscopy to drug discovery to developmental biology. It resulted in several published papers in international journals. Several strands of the research are being taken forward by other PhD projects and are planned to be the subject of future collaborative grant proposals. 

In terms of the series of BioNanoPhotonics scientific symposia, they generated a lot of interest and were attended by 50-100 delegates. They provided a key platform for very useful knowledge exchange within the community and the formation of new collaborations. The intention is to maintain the momentum generated by this series and to run subsequent events through various sponsorships.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C3A486A6-BA86-4F6B-B2EF-4AA522BAA790</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a novel optical microscopy technique to visualise small single metallic nanoparticels (NPs), without the need of any fluorophore labelling, in a very specific and background free way, even in highly scattering environments such as cells and tissues. In this method individual small (radii below 20nm) metallic NPs are visualised with high contrast and photo-stability, free from background and at powers corresponding to negligible photothermal heating, via their coherent nonlinear optical emission called Four-Wave Mixing (FWM) in resonance with the NP surface plasmon. The technique has been implemented to work both in transmission and reflection geometry. It includes a polarisation resolved analysis to detect particle asymmetry, a phase resolved analysis for biosensing, and a time-resolved analysis to quantify thermal and mechanical couplings of NPs with their environments.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB3ACC07-9B34-48D0-A8AB-31307DD1144A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The technique is being utilized extensively over several research projects, including a collaborative project with Bristol University with interest in correlative light-electron microscopy .

The method utilities the simultaneous acquisition of hundreds of nanoparticles for statistical analysis. The method is simple, rapid, and quantitative. We have demonstrated a sensitivity of s_ext =5nm2 corresponding to the detection of a single gold nanoparticle of 5nm diameter, using only ~1min total acquisition time. From the measurement of s_ext and its dependence on the light polarization, an accurate quantification of particle sizes and asymmetries at the single particle level is rapidly obtained for a statistically-relevant number (&amp;gt;100) of particles. An Extinction Suite Macro for ImageJ was also developed, for quantitative data analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC990B17-5516-4C4D-8665-4F41EEE03635</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This technique has generated commercial interested with our industrial collaborators BBI Solution, a world leading nanoparticle manufacturer. Precise characterisation of nanoparticle sizes and shapes is key to manufacturing quality control. Current techniques for particle characterisation are dynamics light scattering (DLS), which is easy to use but not very accurate and provides only the effective mean size (hydrodynamic radius), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) which is time consuming and expensive. The optical extinction microscopy method developed by us overcomes these limitations and effectively complements these analysis techniques. BBI is interested in a knowledge transfer partnership on this technology.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Quantitative Extinction analysis</gtr:title><gtr:type>New/Improved
