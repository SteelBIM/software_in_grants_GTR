Bingo is a markedly under-researched site, attracting a fraction of the attention given to casinos. However it is a globally significant and profitable gambling form, played in many countries and increasingly popular online. Bingo is also enmeshed with law and political economy in distinctive ways. It is a key site for charitable fundraising in many jurisdictions, and it is often associated with community and social welfare. This legal and social position, at the intersection of risk and welfare, poses significant challenges for regulators, and raises important questions about how the governance of speculation is related to concerns about social cohesion and non-profit activity. The proposed research will address those regulatory challenges, and provide answers to those key questions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using four case studies of bingo regulation (England and Wales, Canada, Brazil, and online play offered to residents of EU countries), the research will provide a systematic account of how bingo is regulated, to ascertain the key legal and policy challenges involved, and to make recommendations to policymakers, the gambling industry, third-sector stakeholders, and academics.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will benefit policymakers, gambling law practitioners, industry experts, and the third sector. Several key representatives from these groups have already agreed to participate in the research, and some were involved in the pilot studies, meaning that user involvement has shaped the project from the start.

The project will ascertain the objectives underpinning bingo regulation in key case studies; the perceived effectiveness of regulation; the key challenges involved; and the way in which this sector is understood to relate to (or be distinct from) other gambling sectors. It will also make policy recommendations on the basis of this evidence. This knowledge will be of particular significance for three groups of research users:

1. UK POLICYMAKERS. With the Gambling Act 2005, the UK is recognized globally as a leading site for innovations in gambling regulation. The Act aimed to harmonise regulation across sectors, and allow legitimate gambling businesses to flourish while providing protection for the vulnerable and preventing crime. The UK has since pioneered new approaches to remote licensing for online gambling. However Westminster policymakers recognise that they have a knowledge gap with regard to bingo (May-Chahal et al 2007, 56). The proposed research would fill that gap. At the national level, the research will provide guidance on the sector to the all-party parliamentary group on bingo, and to the Gambling Commission. At a local level it will benefit local and regional policymakers given its review of district council licensing practices and challenges. The study will also document the successes of the current regulatory approach and identify remaining challenges, ensuring that evidence-based policy recommendations can be provided to UK policymakers. Furthermore, it will provide an opportunity to disseminate the findings from the England/Wales case study to other jurisdictions, increasing knowledge of the UK's position internationally while providing UK policymakers with insights from other countries. 

2. UK BINGO INDUSTRY. There are 784 licensed bingo venues in the UK, employing 17,896 people (Gambling Commission 2011, 16). The industry has lobbied Government over several regulatory concerns, and in 2009 66 MPs signed an early day motion to reduce taxes on the industry, as part of a campaign to revive bingo through changes to the Gambling Act 2005. Many of those MPs represented seaside areas, where bingo revitalization is of interest to those concerned with coastal regeneration. Clearly, then, it is important to know more about the impact of the current law on this distinctive sector of the UK economy. The Bingo Association, representing the interests of many commercial operators, has welcomed the research and granted access.

3. UK THIRD SECTOR. Charities are facing increasing oversight, and reduced state revenue, at the same time that their services are in greater demand with the central government shift to increase the role of the third sector in welfare provision. With spending squeezed, regulation increasing, and demand growing, innovative fundraising strategies are of crucial importance, raising key questions about the possibilities, and limits, of the current regulatory approach to charitable gambling. Nothing provides a better lens on this issue than bingo, played in well over 1000 unlicensed sites in the UK for an array of good causes. By offering a systematic study of commercial and charitable gambling, in the UK and abroad, the proposed research will provide the UK third sector with data on the views and concerns of various stakeholders who use bingo to fundraise, as well as lessons from other jurisdictions such as Canada where bingo plays a far more institutionalized role in charitable funding.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>539375</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Andrea Shieber, a photographer, was invited to display her images of bingo players, taken for an advanced photography course at a local college, at the final report launch in June 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0174E6D-42BD-40E2-8F7A-0CC832F3AB50</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The photographs were very well received at the event.

We were given free access to the members' section of the Bingo Association website (which would normally cost &amp;pound;120 a year).

Bingo Association: we have shared all of our findings with the association, including via attendance at their annual meeting, and we invited them to put the industry case directly during the public debate on bingo regulation in London (Oct 2015). The CEO of the organisation made a presentation, and several bingo executives who are members of the association also asked questions to the regulator. The video and photographs that we commissioned from the event were shared with the partner, for their own use. In autumn 2015 the PI wrote an accessible summary of the findings so far for Bingo Life, a trade magazine (https://issuu.com/peterwhite3/docs/bingo_life_021_high_res_new).

Presentation and discussion sponsored by the University's CNPQ funded Research Group on Mercosul and Consumer Rights (O Grupo de Pesquisa CNPQ - Mercosul e Direito do consumidor). Presentation and discussion were in English and Portuguese. Consumer law is a very significant area of legal education and practice in Brazil but there is little knowledge or awareness of how consumer law relates to bingo (or any other aspect of gambling) regulation. The audience consisted of consumer law academics, students (postgraduate and undergraduate) and professional practitioners in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. The purposes of the presentation were to create awareness of the project and its research questions, to foster interest in gambling regulation as an important aspect of Brazilian law and policy, and to get feedback and guidance from consumer law experts about the fieldwork research for the Brazil case study. 

The discussions and questions were excellent and we received good feedback. Audience members (ca.25) and reported that it stimulated their thinking. Another result of the presentation is that Williams and Jobim were commissioned to write a case note on a significant Brazilian Supreme Court that is published in Brazil's main consumer law journal, read by practitioners and policy makers, as well as academics, see Maria Luiza Kurban Jobim and Toni Williams Coment&amp;aacute;rios ao Recurso Especial n&amp;ordm; 1.509.923 - SP.

- the key compliance challenges according to a range of regulatory stakeholders

We presented these findings at a public debate on the key challenges and future directions of bingo regulation in the UK in Oct 2015 (see https://www.kent.ac.uk/thebingoproject/)

For the EU Online case study, we have identified and are analysing: 

- the key law and policy debates that have occurred at the EU and member state level that are relevant for online bingo
- the relevant EU case law and enforcement action dealing with online gambling
- the experiences stakeholders in relation online bingo regulation in the EU
- the key moments relating to online gambling regulation at the EU level and online bingo regulation at the member state level
- The key disputes and challenges 

For the Brazil and Canada case studies we have developed our findings on: 
? the scale of play, player demographics, key providers 
? Timeline of key moments in history of bingo regulation - eg key legislation, scandals, etc 
? Current approach to law/regulation: aims and objectives; who controls what (on the books and in practice)
? key disputes and challenges 

We have produced a final report detailing these findings for non-academic audiences (see https://www.kent.ac.uk/thebingoproject/).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>UK: We have shared our findings with bodies including the Gambling Commission, Bingo Association, Gordon Moody Association, Institute of Licensing, Working Men's Club and Institute Union, Society for the Study of Gambling, and Goldsmiths network on gambling. For example, our findings on formal and informal responsible gambling strategies in commercial bingo can be taken forward by groups specialising in RG, such as the Gordon Moody Association and the Responsible Gambling Trust. Our findings on the need to involve non-commercial operators more systemically in debates about regulation might be taken forward by the WMCIU and the Gambling Commission.

Canada: we shared our findings with academics, regulators, and operators at the Alberta Gambling Research Institute (7-9 April 2016; http://www.abgamblinginstitute.ualberta.ca/en/Events/2016Conference/ConferenceProgram2016.aspx).

Brazil and EU: dissemination (to academics, lawyers, judges, policymakers, and regulators) will be on-going through 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>11F32929-57E1-4B11-96D1-D40FF7EC9802</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.kent.ac.uk/thebingoproject/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Parliamentary review of gambling policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>733DCBFF-4AB4-41DF-8FF4-CDCD4642DF04</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Reference to bingo research by Bedford in Alcohol Concern report.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8DBA608B-6C8A-4109-A6AD-2C29525ABFA4</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.drugsandalcohol.ie/24360/1/Roehampton-Uni-research-Alcohol-Gambling.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Letter to Brazilian Senate about current policy debates on bingo legalisation, to accompany copies of the Final Report and the Brazilian policy briefs.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>South America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B38BF55-E42D-4CFF-85DF-B08C29A9C56A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1923BEB-E712-4E9D-84F5-A8E9D9F29E44"><gtr:id>B1923BEB-E712-4E9D-84F5-A8E9D9F29E44</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regulating Volunteering: Lessons from the Bingo Halls</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Law &amp; Social Inquiry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c5293b13e1cf04061372e343449657b8"><gtr:id>c5293b13e1cf04061372e343449657b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bedford K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B5BE5FB4-90D3-4E31-B84F-D3DA154BA900"><gtr:id>B5BE5FB4-90D3-4E31-B84F-D3DA154BA900</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bingo Regulation and the Feminist Political Economy of Everyday Gambling: In Search of the Anti-Heroic</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Globalizations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c5293b13e1cf04061372e343449657b8"><gtr:id>c5293b13e1cf04061372e343449657b8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bedford K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/30C0E589-9E7C-4FBD-A841-D0782E7BF21F"><gtr:id>30C0E589-9E7C-4FBD-A841-D0782E7BF21F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bingos no Brasil: fardo ou legado?
