Yet, little is known about what function dance and the performing arts fulfill in society, or why TV shows such as &amp;quot;Strictly come dancing&amp;quot; are so popular. We propose that the appeal of dancing and watching dance partly lies in promoting and communicating successful cooperation between people. Research in social psychology has shown that when two people meet, they become more like each other. They imitate each others' accent, speech rate and syntax; they look at the same things and use the same words; they adopt similar postures, gesture alike and gently sway together. This behavioural coordination studied in social psychology seems to produce feelings of liking and affiliation between pairs of people. Similarly, when small groups of people interact, and move together, they also feel closer to each other and are more likely to cooperate. 

We will use dance as a means to study how moving together is linked to liking each other. Similarly, observing other people move together may produce aesthetic pleasure because it showcases successful social interactions. Our research aims to provide novel insights into the role that dance and the performing arts fulfill in modern society. In a set of experiments, we will test this hypothesis by inviting groups of people (non-dancers) to participate in &amp;quot;dance workshop&amp;quot; experiments that teach moving in synchrony. Rather than asking participants to just &amp;quot;do the same&amp;quot;, we will work with professional dancers and choreographers to apply principles from dance and choreography to examine different ways of moving together. Following these workshops, we will assess cooperation, sympathy and liking between participants of the workshop and members of the audience. Performers and audience members will be equipped with small motion sensors and we will also record their electrical brain activity. This will allow us to link different ways of moving in synchrony (or asynchrony) to brain activity, cooperation and liking. In a follow-up functional neuroimaging experiment we will link aesthetic pleasure derived from observing collective human movement to specific brain mechanisms. 

We will also explore clinical applications of our research project. For example the perception of human movement is impaired in patients with autism. Training to move in synchrony might help to improve such deficits in recognizing other people's actions because it requires to carefully monitor how movements are performed. Similarly, increasing awareness of an action by moving in synchrony may boost memory for an already performed action. In obsessive-compulsive disorder compulsive checking involves a vicious circle in which more checking paradoxically leads to less confidence in memory and impairs attention. Increasing action awareness through &amp;quot;over performing&amp;quot; obsessive actions or moving in synchrony with others could thus reduce obsessive behaviours such as washing by making it easier to remember that the action was perfoermed already. 

In summary our research project combines expertise in dance, social psychology and neuroscience (a) to study how cooperation can result form simply moving together, (b) to understand aesthetic appreciation of dance and the perfroming arts, and (c) to develop new treatments for psychological disorders. Further, our research will provide new insights into the role that the perfroming arts fulfill in society and may also yield commercial applications for the creative industries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In our research project we explore the role of dance for social cohesion and cooperation in groups. Beyond the impact within the scientific community we will focus on four impact strategies to ensure a wider societal impact of this research project. 

1) We will collaborate with internationally renowned dance company Siobhan Davies Dance and Choreographer/Dancer Matthias Sperling to develop movement materials suitable for this research project and develop public engagement activities such as open panel discussions and a dance performance. These activities will take place at Siobhan Davies Studios and will be advertised through the companies website and marketing channels. 

2) We will collaborate with Prof Johannes Birringer at Brunel University to document the research project through the website of the Design and Performance Lab at Brunel University. The impact of the DAP live streaming channel has been considerable; since its inception 2011, the channel has produced more than fifty broadcasts that were viewed by circa 15000 viewers worldwide.

3) We will examine commercial applications of movement aesthetics by liaising with the design and fashion industry (Sara Hemming, Art Director Another Magazine, Creative Director DJA). Advertising increasingly moves from using still photography to film and animation. Already, fashion and design magazines routinely hire choreographers to assist in shooting. Accordingly, it is no longer enough to understand the aesthetics of how static visual images are composed, but it becomes increasingly important to understand the principles that mediate aesthetic appreciation of individual and collective human movement. Throughout this project we will explore commercial applications of our research in this field.

4) We will explore clinical applications of a movement-based therapy in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder in collaboration with Dr Annemiek Apergis-Schoute and Prof Barbara Sahakian (University of Cambridge). Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a heterogeneous disorder, in which checking followed by washing are the most common compulsions, affecting around 2/3 of adults with OCD. Compulsive checking involves a vicious circle in which more checking paradoxically leads to less confidence in memory and impairs attention. We propose a new treatment of OCD based on &amp;quot;action awareness&amp;quot; where the patient will &amp;quot;over perform&amp;quot; the compulsion - by breaking the action down into components and attending to how the action &amp;quot;feels&amp;quot;, as to train higher awareness and memory of the action which is normally an &amp;quot;automatic&amp;quot; compulsive behaviour. Performing movements in synchrony implies action awareness: In order to synchronize movements with others, patients will need to focus on how movements are performed, thus boosting memory and attention for compulsive behaviours. Further, the perception of human movement kinematics is impaired in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Increasing action awareness might help to improve such deficits in action recognition in this patient group.

The result is a curious hybrid where performers that seem to be animating text gradually transform, sliding into their own compelling language and revealing an emotional physicality that raises more questions than answers. The tension becomes palpable as the safe rug of scientific knowledge slips from under the audience's seats.

Our True Feelings exists as a lecture version that involves audiences in experiments and discussed declaration of their feelings about emotions under certain conditions.

Each of the works draws upon the library and practices of the art historian Aby Warburg, who collected diverse images of gestures from different times and places and positioned them side-by-side to reveal previously-hidden relationships. As they interrogate the fascinating relationship between mind and body the artists create new works including choreography exploring lost movements from the past, interactive structures examining the postures of an argument and a series of hanging mobiles inspired by Albrecht D&amp;uuml;rer's Melancholia.

The events communicated our findings to the general public and more specifically - engaged with performing artists, arts managers and curators. The events were reported on widely on social media and were reported on in the guardian national news paper.

Our research project has directly provided input to three dance productions that were performed at the Barbican and Sadlers Wells theatres respectively, and are now touring nationally and internationally.

The PI has also taken on a role as &amp;quot;scientist in residence&amp;quot; at the advertising agency adamandeve/ddb, contributing to to pitches and campaings that have a link to synchronised activities, e.g. for sky sports or body and face perception, e.g. Max cosmetics.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>104F2925-10E5-424D-AF9A-1A54A4D7199B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Moving in synchrony is an important aspect of human behaviour. It underlies performative art such as dance and music and is associated with social cohesion and group affiliation. We successfully completed a series of experiments in which we studied the psychological and brain mechanisms of moving together and watching other people move together. 

In collaboration with a professional choreographer we developed a set of movement tasks for experimental purposes. These tasks also formed the basis for a dance piece that was used to study the effects of watching other people move together and forms the basis of a series of public engagement events related to this project. 

During performing and watching of this choreography, we assessed synchrony of individual acceleration profiles among professional dancers and novices and psychophysiological responses using wrist sensor technology. We also recorded continuous ratings of aesthetic appreciation and perceived group characteristics. Our findings show that behavioural coordination of movement predicts group affiliation among performers and audience enjoyment when watching these synchronised movements.

In a follow-up fMRI study, we identified the neural mechanisms of watching other people move together, as a function of behavioural coordination among performers. In this study we were able to show that correlations in spectators brain activity are closely related to the synchrony of performer movements on stage. Brain activity is more synchronised in expert dancers than in novice observers. Moreover the synchronisation is greatest in brain areas traditionally associated with human movement perception inferring intentions and emotions form observed movement. 

We also completed an large-scale online study in which we compared aesthetic perception of movement synchrony across cultures, between UK and Japanese participants using a wide range of videos that either displayed synchronous or asynchronous group activities. Japanese society is often being characterised as collectivistic, whereas Western societies such as the UK are often characterised as individualistic societies. We predicted that Japanese participants would aesthetically prefer synchronous over asynchronous performances. Our results were in line with this idea: Japanese participants enjoyed watching synchronous performances more than asynchronous performances; British participants showed an effect in the opposite direction. These findings suggest that aesthetic judgements of the performative arts can be used as implicit measures of cultural values: People's preference should reflect not only individually acquired tastes, but also the norms and values held in their cultural environment.

In summary, Our findings thus point to an evolutionary function of dance - and perhaps all performing arts - in communicating social signals between groups of people. Movement synchrony is not only associated with increased group affiliation in those who perform synchronous actions, but also predicts aesthetic judgement of performative art. These aesthetic judgement reflect both dynamic culturally held values that concern the relationship between the individual and society.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have implications for culture, education, healthcare and the creative economy and future research.

Our research project is the first to study behavioural coordination in groups and performing arts aesthetics (a) using wrist sensor technology to quantify group behaviour and (b) in a ecologically valid live theatre environment. Our findings have attracted substantial interest at academic conferences and two academic papers are currently in revision fro publication the high-impact scientific journals. As such we believe that the outcomes of this research project demonstrate that are large scale naturalistic experimental studies on group behaviour and performing arts aesthetics are feasible and make an important contribution.

Our findings provide insights to artists and performing arts institutions into how performative movement produces aesthetic impact. Our findings can help to explain why people engage in collective activities such as dancing or making music together, or why attending live concerts collectively can be such a pleasurable experience (Culture/Heritage/Museums/Collections). Our findings have already informed two dance productions that were performed at the Barbican and Sadlers Wells Theatre in London. Both work will continue to tour nationally and internationally. 

The movement tasks developed for this research project may also find applications in schools and extracurricular activities. In particular, children with learning difficulities or social anxiety may benefit from the prosocial effects of moving together. We are also preparing a grant application in collation with the National Gallery that will explore the role of embodied practices such as dancing to increase engagement with classical visual art (Education/Healthcare)

To the extent that video and film gain increasing importance in advertising and the creative industries (e.g. fashion) our findings inform about the aesthetic impact of collective movement (Creative Economy). The PI has taken up a scientist in residence post with the advertising agency adamandeve/ddb, contributing to pitches and campaigns that relate to collective sports or entertainment, e.g. sky sports. 

Despite difficulties with clinical partners and patient access for this high risk study, our research yields potential fro developing new performing arts based treatment for neuropsychological disorders with a strong motor component and and compulsive behaviours such as OCD or Autism (Healthcare).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6C238E58-DB80-4DDE-8D7A-A1EADFBCC27D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Creative Economy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1282F39B-8858-4680-A84D-BBAD9FC4EC43"><gtr:id>1282F39B-8858-4680-A84D-BBAD9FC4EC43</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cerebral mechanisms underlying the effects of music during a fatiguing isometric ankle-dorsiflexion task.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychophysiology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ebf1b1783c1d19f5b4c3de9580aa395c"><gtr:id>ebf1b1783c1d19f5b4c3de9580aa395c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bigliassi M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0048-5772</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F5781AAA-1978-4D10-8412-CD7403220116"><gtr:id>F5781AAA-1978-4D10-8412-CD7403220116</gtr:id><gtr:title>Joint action aesthetics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>PLOS ONE</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/61680bc06d96ff39f67a7dae4b7504a1"><gtr:id>61680bc06d96ff39f67a7dae4b7504a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vicary S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5089AC98-E7FA-4E39-B0E1-23103070F8FF"><gtr:id>5089AC98-E7FA-4E39-B0E1-23103070F8FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Verbal Synchrony and Action Dynamics in Large Groups.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/db00b2d6c4c40b534e9e995fe36c063c"><gtr:id>db00b2d6c4c40b534e9e995fe36c063c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>von Zimmermann J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-1078</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/68F9A030-696A-4A02-A4B9-A64A5171F86E"><gtr:id>68F9A030-696A-4A02-A4B9-A64A5171F86E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shared Representations -
