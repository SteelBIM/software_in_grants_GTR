- The greenness and dynamics of economies;
- Metrics and indicators for a green economy;
- Policies planning, and institutions (including business) for a green economy 
- Green economy in cities and metropolitan areas.

A focus on resources, sustainable consumption and production is at the heart of the principles of the Green Economy, according to the UN. China and Europe have highlighted the importance of resource-efficiency and moving towards a 'circular economy'. Europe has adopted Resource Efficiency as a flagship initiative, and China passed a Circular Economy Law in 2009. In light of these policy developments, there is a need to better understand the importance of resource efficiency on economic performance, the metrics and indicators through which action can be motivated and monitored, the underlying drivers of change and prospects for the future, as well as the role of institutions and policies. SINCERE has been developed to address these issues by bringing together leading researchers from five countries: UCL ISR in the UK, the Institute for Applied Ecology in China, Wuppertal University and FHI-ISI in Germany, ParisMinesTech in France and UM-MERIT in the Netherlands.

A number of sometimes conflicting concepts can be found in debate describing desirable futures, e.g. the Green Economy, Sustainable Growth, etc. As the difference and the overlap across them is not always clear it is important to implement theoretical comparisons of these concepts and case studies exploring how they have been applied in Europe and China. Particular importance will be given to the Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency (CE/RE) and how they relate to the Green Economy. In addition to help deliver clarity in the theoretical debate, SINCERE will deliver new indicators for measuring CE/RE. As Indicators are critical for achieving policy goals, we will tackle them from three different angles through Emergy, innovation and SGAP-based indicators.

Policy and Institutional settings are clearly very influential on how our society moves towards a Green Economy. The journey of innovations from laboratories to the marketplace is very influenced by policies and institutions supposed to tackle the obstacles normally faced by new technologies. SINCERE will examine the importance of innovation in enabling resource efficiency, both in China and Europe, and will study what enables and prevents the development of new, resource-efficient technologies.

In the last part of the project SINCERE will examining historical patterns between CE/RE and macro-economic performance with particular focus on the relationship between CE/RE, economic competiveness, trade, and industrial structure. After having assessed past trends SINCERE will model how the future might look like by producing scenarios to analyse the implications of CE/RE on the economy, and the impact of policies. This will include multi-scale modelling, from the urban to the global scale. Models play a key role in economic and environmental policy, but often the issue of resources has been sidelined in economic modelling, leaving policymakers without clear guidance on the importance of the issues. Our modelling work will advance the state-of-the-art for analysis of the macro-economics of resources. 

SINCERE is a collaborative project building on the comparative advantage of the partners and their knowledge of the national context to develop a truly multi-disciplinary project where disciplines such as neoclassical economic, system dynamics, econometrics, ecology and innovation studies find a space to make an overall compelling picture. Our workplan is integrated to ensure that this project has a legacy so that the ties developed between European and Chinese partners are here to stay and produce future projects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will provide evidence of considerable value to policymakers. Both the EU and China, along with many EU member states, have adopted high-level policies to advance resource efficiency and circular economy aspirations. However, existing data and insights are limited, both in terms of the likely economic implications of achieving higher levels of resource efficiency, and in terms of the drivers (principally innovation and technological change) of resource efficiency and the way in which these can be influenced by policy. 

Through developing indicators for studying the green economy, we will enable researchers statistical agencies to better monitor resource efficiency. In particular, it is envisaged that recommendations will be made to the European Environment Agency and China's Ministry of Environmental Protection for indicators to use in monitoring progress towards resource efficiency and circular economy goals. The letters of support indicate interest from policy organisations (such as ADEME) and policy advisory bodies (e.g. OECD), and it is expected that this interest will grow as the project develops further insights and evidence. 

Evidence on the comparative innovation performance, and on the effectiveness of innovation policy support, will be of direct use for those involved in developing innovation policy for resource efficiency. The analysis of co-evolution of policy with innovation system activities is likely to yield conclusions about policy design and co-ordination. 

By advancing the state-of-the-art in macro-modelling of resource efficiency, SINCERE will enhance the analytic capacity of researchers and policy organisations for studying the importance of resource efficiency. The benefits will be felt both in terms of the substantive conclusions (for example, on the relative importance of various factors in contributing to resource efficiency at the macro level), and in terms of the methodological insights. 

Impact will be achieved through the engagement of stakeholders directly in the work; through publication and dissemination of outputs; through the development of datasets and tools that will be springboards for further analysis - all these are set out in the pathways to impact plan.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>406295</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>CIRED</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Belgium, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Modelling Forum</gtr:description><gtr:id>D965B4CC-9CF0-4498-9803-8E52110F6404</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the OECD ENV macro-economic modelling team attended.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Other contributions came from JF Mercure, M.

The meeting on 13th and 14th of October 2016 in Paris is targeted at understanding the current state of the art of incorporating endogenous technological change into top-down macroeconomic modelling tools, including equilibrium-based models such as GEM-E3 and econometric/disequilibrium models, as well as understanding and sharing the practical experiences and difficulties involved in implementing such innovation modelling. With several projects focussed on issues related to the area (GREEN-WIN, SINCERE, INNOPATHS, RIPPLES, CIRCLE) this meeting is a chance to learn from each other's practical experiences in an open environment, and thereby inform a number of model-based projects developing over the coming year(s).
We organized the forum and contributed two inputs, one on resource efficiency, another one on CGE Perspectives on how to approach modelling innovation and finance.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Panel contribution National CSR Awards, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0916E73-DE71-4AE6-A200-887856EDAEA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited panelist at the National CSR Awards, London 12 May 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://nationalcsrawards.co.uk/csr-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy panel on the circular economy at EAERE</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>664E94A0-DCC7-4847-A6F1-8714DA5A5905</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I organized a policy session at the Annual meeting of the European Association of Environmental and Resource Economists on 23 June 2016 in Zurich, entitled A Circular Economy in Europe: Relevance, Issues, and Policy Options. Speakers and contributions to the session:
? Prof. Dr. Raimund Bleischwitz, Deputy Director and Chair on sustainable global resources at the UCL Institute for Sustainable Resources, formerly member of the EU expert group on a systemic approach to eco-innovation and a circular economy, currently leads a collaboration project on the circular economy with Chinese partners. He will present findings on different circular economy concepts, the 'web of constraints' hindering firms to eco-innovate, and policy tools.
? Robbert Droop, Dutch Ministry for the Environment, leads the Dutch delegation e.g. at the EU Horizon 2020 programme on a circular economy and for the EU Environment Council. He will present findings and experience from the Dutch EU presidency in the 1st half of 2016 and give an outlook on expected changes (the usual disclaimer applies). Furthermore he will share insights from The Netherlands on the topic.
? Prof. Dr. Paul JJ Welfens is the president of the European Institute for International Economic Relations (EIIIW) at the University of Wuppertal and has the Jean Monnet Chair in European Integration and also a chair in Macroeconomics. He will emphasise the economics of recycling and green ICT as two pillars of a circular economy in Europe - the role of (green) ICT is much underestimated&amp;nbsp;in the policy community, and international diffusion of best practice in recycling stands for a new challenge. Moreover, key insights from the EIIW-vita composite sustainability indicator will be presented in line with the OECD requirements on&amp;nbsp;composite indicators.
? Prof. Roberto Zoboli, full professor of environmental economics at Catholic University of Milan, is leader of the work package on 'Sectoral integration and the green economy' of ETC/WMGE - the topic centre of the European Environment Agency on 'Waste and Materials in a Green Economy'. He is currently involved in the activities on circular economy of ETC/WMGE and the European Reference Model on Waste managed by EEA. He will present some emerging issues in the economic measurement and implications of a circular economy (e.g. net value added and employment creation) vis &amp;agrave; vis its environmental implications. This critical role of integrated economic and environmental assessment for a European circular economy policy will be discussed also with reference to international aspects (e.g. trade).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eaere2016.ethz.ch</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at Centre Cournot</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C2DE74DD-ABDC-4E5B-8646-018994BD45EA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I gave a seminar speech on 25th May at the Centre Cournot in Paris, France, on &amp;quot;Jevons and the dynamics of industrialisations:
