The 'lure-and-kill' system developed by the project will provide 'proof of concept' for other pests and crops.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project will provide a bridge between industry research and academic research to allow development of the lure-and-kill innovation into a commercially viable product. Successful delivery of the project would provide positive feedback in allowing partners to realise the benefit of investing in R&amp;amp;D. The system will be transferable to other pests and crops. Increasing the confidence of growers that yield and quality impact can be controlled using this system could lead to an increase in the area of peas and beans grown in the UK. The SMEs in the consortium (PGRO, Exosect, Oecos and Velcourt) would grow and the large company (BASF) would market project outcomes overseas.

The project would generate economic benefit and value to the UK economy on several levels: 
a) Pea and bean growers in the UK and the main global pulse growing regions would benefit from reduced yield and quality losses and more efficient farm operations and from reductions in pesticide applications.
b) Pulse crops are nitrogen fixing and have great benefits in the crop rotation as they can help to reduce the build-up of pests, weeds and diseases of other crops. They also provide a valuable source of vegetable protein. Thus, there would be wider benefits from making their production more reliable for growers. Government and EU policy has identified protein crops as high priority for research and development, to increase levels of home-grown pulses to supply animal feed markets and increase sustainability of supplies by reducing soya bean imports. The market for UK pulses is currently undersupplied and potential for creating new markets for human consumption products, whilst increasing levels of pulse protein in animal feed is high.
c) There is potential to increase the export market of UK grown peas and beans, especially if grower confidence in yield and quality is improved.
d) The knowledge economy of the UK would benefit as companies realise the opportunity for meeting gaps in the market in agriculture by investing in R&amp;amp;D to deliver innovation (which is urgently needed for crop protection).
e) The manufacturing sector would grow as the UK develops new crop protection solutions for the home and export markets.
f) The project, by contributing to more efficient crop production, would help to maintain lower food prices with consequent health, social and economic benefits for society in general. Food prices are at historically low levels as a proportion of income but collapses in crop protection in the EU could lead to rising food costs, especially as imported food might not remain as inexpensive as it currently is as countries such as China become more affluent and increase their purchasing power.
g) More efficient crop production (lower losses to pests) reduces the environmental impact of agriculture as less land, water, fertiliser and energy are used to grow equivalent quantities.
Successful delivery of the project objectives would allow further research in other crops and pests, increasing the value of the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>270483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rawcliffe Bridge</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9760EEF3-5B92-4F6C-A5AB-3FE34343E0D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of research to professional Agronomists</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>JIC visit</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2E5401E-9DC3-401E-B006-7F4F458ED22E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Toby Bruce - Visit to the John Innes Centre for discussion and to give a talk</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Agri Tech blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4DB13EAD-46BB-47E2-8C92-048AB7257CC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I wrote an invited blog for the AgriTech website</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://agritech.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/27/agritech-catalyst-beetles/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hert Farmers</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>636C8075-50FB-4ACF-BF02-2919E818DF39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Toby Bruce - talk about crop protection given to Hertfordshire Farmers breakfast meeting</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.hertsfarmerscalendar.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Association of Independent Crop Consulants (AICC) Technical  Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>87D80150-7D80-428D-BEE9-F52318BB288B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2015 Toby Bruce gave a demonstration of the prototype CROPROTECT website and got valuable feedback from potential users

Currently blanket sprays of insecticide are used against the pea and bean weevil (Sitona lineatus) which attacks nitrogen fixing root nodules of field beans and peas and the bruchid beetle (Bruchus rufimanus) which severely reduces the saleable quality of field beans by burrowing holes in them. Instead of applying blanket sprays to the entire crop canopy, which is hard to penetrate and makes targeted application difficult, our vision is to lure the pests to a bait station containing small amounts of bioinsecticide which stick to the body of the pest. This will improve the targeting of the control measures and provide a much needed new solution because pyrethroid pesticide resistance is evolving in the pea and bean weevil.

For the project, BASF and Exosect are supplying isolates of entomopathogenic fungus (a naturally occurring fungal disease of insects). Exosect are formulating them with Entostat, an electrostatically charged micropowder they have developed, which sticks the fungi to the body of the pest. This can be used as a carrier for insecticides or bioinsecticides. Rothamsted have identified an aggregation pheromone specific for the pea and bean weevil which attracts both sexes and floral attractants for the bruchid beetle. These attractants will be formulated with the killing agent and placed strategically in inoculation stations in the field that we will develop with another project partner, Oecos.
Since the project started in October 2014, our first steps have been to determine and control the release rate of the attractants over time (a critical component of product longevity), and to determine the effectiveness of the different treatments in killing the pests. We have been measuring the release rate of the attractants by collecting them from air drawn over the test formulations. Odours collected on a filter are analysed by gas chromatography which allows us to quantify the amount of chemical released over a given time period. We are working with Exosect to improve the longevity of the product.

We have been testing in the lab the effectiveness of two strains of the insect fungal disease together with alpha-cypermethrin as a standard insecticide. Different doses of formulation have been put in Petri dishes and 10 beetles put in each dish. Numbers of dead insects are recorded at regular intervals for three weeks. The insect mortality results to date are encouraging and not only show that the insect fungal disease works but also that the effectiveness of the conventional insecticide is improved. Thus the components are being assembled for the &amp;quot;lure-and-kill&amp;quot; system.

We have also been testing field cages for the next stage when we do field cage trials which are planned for spring 2016. Parallel trials at Rothamsted and PGRO have shown that the cages provide good containment of the insects and therefore can be used to separate different treatments when we do the first small scale tests of the new system in outdoor conditions.

Our project will provide a new pest management solution (lure and kill) for beetle pests in pea and bean crops, a solution which may be transferable to other cropping systems. The benefits to the grower will be: increased pest control through a more targeted application of the insecticide; reduced use of insecticide per hectare; the option of different modes of killing agent which allows the product to be available to both conventional and organic growers; and as large volumes of water are not be required for uniform application, this product can be applied during periods of water shortages. There is an urgent need for new solutions due to pesticide resistance problems and concern about effects of pesticides on non-target species. The inoculation station with insect fungal disease would be a biological solution to the problem but lure-and-kill will also enable better targetting of conventional pesticides by using specific attractants to limit the classes of insects that come into contact with them.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This concept could be applied to other pests and could dramatically improved the targeting of control interventions. Using a selective semiochemical could improve the selectivity of a conventional pesticide and better targeting improve their environmental profile.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2CEA202A-CA2C-41AE-BDA2-DD158F625382</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://agritech.blog.gov.uk/2015/07/27/agritech-catalyst-beetles/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Responded to Parliament Consultation on Science Budget</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B604F42-A895-4E00-A18B-AFCBB8B7324F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/WrittenEvidence/CommitteeEvidence.svc/EvidenceDocument/Science%20and%20Technology/The%20science%20budget/written/19829.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Provided written evidence to the UK science spending review</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DC0BDA1-31AA-4D3C-9A71-11E5E6C05C70</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/science-and-technology-committee/the-science-budget/written/19829.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>BIS consultation about Innovation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17688B1D-2003-4209-9785-DEC01D3DE347</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Leaving the EU: implications and opportunities for science and research</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0EDF9B2E-A8AE-46A0-8E5D-0E8510028B11</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/science-and-technology-committee/leaving-the-eu-implications-and-opportunities-for-science-and-research/written/35007.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DDBCDEC1-E873-4743-A010-3EA0D897CB11"><gtr:id>DDBCDEC1-E873-4743-A010-3EA0D897CB11</gtr:id><gtr:title>The CROPROTECT project and wider opportunities to improve farm productivity through web-based knowledge exchange.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Food and energy security</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5fefe6feea0bf9877fac8c49c9a4c598"><gtr:id>5fefe6feea0bf9877fac8c49c9a4c598</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bruce TJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>2048-3694</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M011542/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>59B04DEC-70F4-4AD4-893B-ADCAF14F8BE9</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M011542/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>270483.22</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>886D1C76-07AF-45E7-924D-2A2769B1367D</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>BB/M011542/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>97041.24</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>6F3E4891-E3E8-4568-94D8-075A0552DE90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Crop protection</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
