archaeological data entry encourage use of controlled vocabulary but the means to achieve this are lacking. Many datasets simply have free text descriptions. Other databases employ pick lists based on major thesauri but the output is still text rather than any standard ID that other databases will employ. Links to online thesauri exist with some web based data entry systems but free text entry inevitably leads to errors of various kinds. Controlled vocabularies are not readily available in standard semantic formats and easy means to provide controlled indexing are not generally available. Data providers lack an efficient way to provide uniquely identified controlled indexing of data that is compatible with semantic technologies and standards. 

Knowledge Exchange (KE) activities based on enhanced vocabulary services are the focus of the proposed work. The general aim is to provide the means to encourage, but not force, data providers to use controlled types, by providing services to do this easily, together with tools for retrospective enrichment of existing datasets. 

The work follows on from the STAR project that developed web services and user interface widgets that will be adapted and extended to meet the user needs described in this proposal. The services and KE activities will make it significantly easier for data providers to index their data with uniquely identified (machine readable) controlled terminology - ie semantically enriched and compatible with Linked Data. A further aim is to make it easier for vocabulary providers to make their vocabularies available in this format. 

The project builds on the STAR/STELLAR collaboration between University of Glamorgan Hypermedia Research Unit and the Archaeology Data Service (ADS), with ADS playing a dual role as co-Investigators and users of the project outcomes. The work is in collaboration with project partners, English Heritage, who act as both vocabulary providers and users of the linked data creation and semantic enrichment services, together with RCAHMS and RCAHMW, in their role as national vocabulary standards setting bodies. Wessex Archaeology Ltd. and the Bespoke HER User Group join through their association as heritage data managers, data providers to Local Authorities and users of ADS resources. 

The project will employ three major vocabulary resources maintained by EH as exemplars - the Monument Types Thesaurus, the Event Types Thesaurus and the MIDAS Archaeological Periods List. These resources will be converted to standard machine readable data formats and made freely available under a suitable open licensing arrangement. It is anticipated that converting these resources into standard linked data format with unique identifiers will encourage wider use of controlled terminology by archaeology users and act as exemplar for the wider cultural heritage domain. RESTful web services will be developed for the project to make the vocabulary resources programmatically accessible and searchable. These will include provision to 'feed back' new terms (concepts) suggested by users. 

Summary of the main anticipated outcomes:
- Freely accessible and reusable persistent vocabulary resources as linked data, the techniques to achieve this being made freely available
- Web Services to SKOS representations of the vocabularies and semantic enrichment services, along with web application components 
- Knowledge exchange for semi-automatic tools (using the services) to facilitate retrospective semantic alignment of existing datasets
- Knowledge exchange for tools to facilitate semantic enrichment (via URIs) within data entry
- Mechanism for feedback of supplementary terms to augment existing vocabularies
- The software developed will be available as open source.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The main aim of the FOF funding scheme is knowledge exchange (KE) to support innovative and creative engagements with new audiences beyond academia. Thus the proposed work is very closely concerned with pathways to impact. 

The problems that hinder the creation and the use of uniquely identifiable (linked) data vocabulary resources are widespread across different sectors. Data providers lack an easy means to provide uniquely identified controlled indexing of data that is compatible with semantic technologies and standards, such as linked data and SKOS. Currently thesauri are not fully part of the workflow for user indexing and search. 

The list of collaborators demonstrates the wide scope of the work's impact, including the national Archaeology Data Service (ADS), English Heritage together with RCAHMS and RCAHMW, Bespoke HER User Group (BHER) and a major commercial archaeology unit (Wessex).

An obvious group that will benefit is the ADS user community. This comprises a broad range of users, including National and local government archaeologists and cultural heritage managers, museums and commercial archaeologists and members of the public (as well as HE). The project's results will be immediately useful to significant infrastructure services, such as the FISH Toolkit and OASIS. 

Project partners, English Heritage together with RCAHMS and RCAHMW, will be enabled to make vocabulary resources available as Linked Data facilitating wider use, the techniques to achieve this being made freely available. Project outcomes are directly applicable to applications such as the Heritage Gateway, while the resulting infrastucture improvements are broadly relevant to the National Heritage Protection Plan. Persistent vocabulary resources would be readily reusable across the domain. 

The outcomes would be useful for other sectors more generally (HERs, national and local government curators, commercial bodies, museums). This will deliver significant benefit beyond HE, including third sector and commercial, as shown by the new audiences represented by project partners, the HER community and Wessex Archaeology Ltd., in addition to the wider national audiences represented by RCAHMS /W. The partners together with ADS, as standards and practice influencing bodies, are well placed to disseminate the outcomes of the feasibility studies to their respective sectors.

Controlled vocabularies have the potential to act as hubs in the emerging Web of Data; the methods, guidelines and experience will be of benefit to the ongoing efforts in Linked Data by government and others associated with the open data approach. The enhanced linking of archaeological data will promote its integration into the broader semantic web, breaking down subject domain barriers as well as barriers between academic, commercial and government based archaeological practice.

Cross-fertilisation is likely with various European and transatlantic projects the project team are involved in, such as TAG: Transatlantic Archaeological Gateway, ESFRI DARIAH (ARENA2), CARARE (Europeana), Digging into Metadata. 

The project will provide technical tools and also lead to new working practices for controlled metadata. The feasibility studies will serve as a vehicle for KE and dissemination, together with the two project workshops. In addition, the ADS and Glamorgan will engage in the dissemination activities outlined in the proposal. ADS engages in a series of regular dissemination activities under the direction of its Deputy Director (Access) (the Co-I). These activities include newsletters, RSS, twitter, blogs and other social media and the utilisation of email lists ( c.1000 subscribers). The project team regularly presents at national and international conferences and engages in an extensive programme of visits and guest lectures, all of which offer opportunities to disseminate project outputs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>76161</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland (RCAHMS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>RCAHMS</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8A0F134-8875-4164-94AA-D8F4E44A0446</gtr:id><gtr:impact>General SENESCHAL project outcomes and outputs

His contributions included design of the CRM-EH ontology, intellectual mapping of datasets to CRM-EH, writing and presenting outcomes, etc.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>STAR, STELLAR and SENESCHAL outcomes made a significant contribution to EH strategic objectivies in digital heritage and vocabulary management and standards.

In STAR, The collaboration with English Heritage (EH) on digital archaeology has been interdisciplinary. EH have seen direct benefit, both to their datasets and the wider exposure of their thesauri via the terminology services and the implementation of their extension to the CIDOC CRM ontology for archaeology. The following remarks on the project's significance are contributed by EH. &amp;quot;One key outcome of STAR has been the development and dissemination of the EH ontological modelling (referred to by the project as the CRM-EH) in RDF, which otherwise would have been unlikely to have happened, and certainly not as soon. Another outcome from STAR has been the enhanced awareness of the CRM-EH and its ontological basis in the CIDOC CRM across wider cultural heritage and related IT sectors which has been significantly increased through the various STAR project publications, workshops and project team attendance at conferences and presentations. This has helped EH in promoting the potential use of standards like CIDOC CRM, SKOS and Thesauri for developing interoperability in the sector. Conversion of the EH Thesauri into SKOS format would have been very unlikely to happen so succinctly and effectively without the R&amp;amp;D expertise provided by partnership with Glamorgan Uni. This is a major benefit and considerable technological step forward for our sector that will have benefits across and beyond the heritage sector where the EH thesauri and related terminologies are the most widely used resource of their type. An example of this is the development by the STAR project of the SKOS terminology web services, particularly for other related resources such as ADS, which will most likely facilitate enhancement of the thesauri in SKOS format for the OASIS pan-UK online archaeological reporting system. &amp;quot;

in SENESCHAL
We (and the vocabulary partners in the SENESCHAL project) published as (SKOS) Linked Data the nationally recognised cultural heritage thesauri standards from English Heritage, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales. This includes concepts widely used for indexing relating to monument types, archaeological events and time periods. 
The significance is that previously the vocabulary providers lacked the ability to facilitate uniquely identified semantic indexing of data. Major thesauri can act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data (as suggested by W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group). For example, the availability of the Thesaurus of Monument Terms in this way is seen as a major development for the ADS archive metadata Linked Data . This Linked Data publication of the English Heritage thesauri is a significant development in their vocabulary standards practice and their information access strategy. 

The potential reach is wide since it is a core activity of ADS, English Heritage, The Royal Commissions on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland/Wales to promote and disseminate best practice to the heritage sectors, as well as providing guidance on appropriate data standards including thesauri. The linked data vocabularies and web services will be integrated into the widely used ADS reporting/archiving tool, OASIS, which is in near universal use by commercial and local government archaeologists. Adoption of linked data based vocabulary management in this tool will immediately affect how all sectors engage in archaeological field practice and development control planning. 
We represented the English Heritage archaeological extension to the CRM ontology in RDF and as Linked Data. This allowed it to be a key ontology hub in the ADS archaeology Linked Data. This is another important step in English Heritage's strategic plans for information standards.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of York</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Archaeology Data Service (ADS)</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Archaeology Data Service (ADS)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1114FED4-15BE-4BDB-BC8F-590ACF57ECAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>STAR, STELLAR, SENESCHAL project outcomes and outputs

The research on semantic data integration (STELLAR) provided tools and techniques that enabled the Archaeology Data Service (ADS http://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/) to extract and publish Linked Data from major commercial archaeology units' excavation datasets, integrated semantically via mapping to the CIDOC CRM ontology. It is envisaged this will serve as a catalyst for further production of archaeological Linked Data by ADS and others. Building on this work, we are leading the FP7 ARIADNE archaeology e-infrastructure Work Package, Linking Archaeology Data.

The research enabled ADS (non-specialists in semantic technologies) first foray into Linked Data and represents a major development in practice and capability by ADS and in UK archaeological data publication. It has generated considerable attention. The significance also derives from the importance of the published datasets and the exemplar. The Linked Data includes datasets drawn the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund, major archaeological programmes with excavations undertaken by two of the largest commercial units in England (Oxford Archaeology Ltd and Wessex Archaeology Ltd). Other datasets included an excavation database with details of the earliest ironworking yet known in Britain. As the only record of unrepeatable fieldwork, it is essential that these data are preserved and made available for re-use and re-interpretation.

Ceri Binding of the University of South Wales gave a PPT presentation on the SENESCHAL project, the main deliverables of which are to produce controlled vocabularies online, Web services and tools to align data with controlled vocabularies. The presentation is available on the FISH Website.
The meeting then discussed this project and the use of controlled vocabulary at length. Discussions included whether the products of this project could be used to create a vocabulary of pottery wares/fabrics; the potential use in the development of OASIS; the next SWISH development; the potential for the creation of the Thesaurus of Cultural Heritage; application with HLC; use with the FISH Toolkit.
Practical issues associated with maintaining and hosting the various tools were discussed as CB said that the aim of the project was to create the tools and didn't focus on future maintenance or hosting. Various suggestions were made including ownership by FISH and the creation of the persistent URIs. The sustainability of these was raised with the possible involvement of the ADS. 
...
GG asked what FISH had to do to in terms of disseminating and getting buy in from the represented organisations to implement and use these products and tools. One area talked about was the use of these tools with the HERs - HBSMR and Bespoke HERs.
Other discussion was on the need to influence funding bodies, eg AHRC to encourage the practical applications of these tools.
The discussion covered linked open data and possible issues with licensing for commercial use. 


Again there was a very positive response, further progressing the alignment of the project with and aid the work the FISH terminology working group and HER's and the English heritage research agenda.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://fishforum.weebly.com/fish-heirnet-meetings.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop at RCAHMW, Aberystwyth</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6220BF9C-12B8-4BD4-97C0-546DDA791D78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The third of three workshops on SENESCHAL project outcomes part of a regular Welsh Extended National Database Technical Working Group meeting organised by RCAHMW.

On 14 May 2014 the Council for British Archaeology (CBA) hosted a one-day seminar on behalf of FISH and HEIRNET at the University of York to discuss common issues facing the historic environment information sector and make progress towards a shared vision and agenda for historic environment information management.

The key aims of the seminar were to:
Encourage discussion between different groups that produce and manage historic environment information from across the sector (professional, research and voluntary to identify common goals and issues.
Develop information sharing networks and working partnerships across the sector to pool resources particularly in the areas of skills development and application of information technology.

The one-day seminar will bring together a diverse group of representatives from across different areas of the sector in 'world caf&amp;eacute; style' discussion sessions. Delegates will be rotated between tables to encourage new dialogue between individuals representing different areas of the sector. Each session will start with three keynotes introducing different topics within the main theme followed by breakout sessions to discuss key issues and look at potential solutions.

A parallel 'virtual' seminar was held alongside the York seminar to encourage remote participation.

We presented one of the keynote talks on SENESCHAL project outcomes.

The SENESCHAL presentation contributed to the discussions on this high level, strategic planning meeting for the sector, organised by Council for British Archaeology and English Heritage. Various follow on plans are being developed. The SENESCHAL team at University South Wales has been invited to participate in FISH HEIRET meetings. http://fishforum.weebly.com/fish-heirnet-meetings.html 

&amp;quot;HEIRNET - the Historic Environment Information Resources Network - was formed by a group of organisations with an interest in information relating to archaeology and the historic environment. HEIRNET enables access to Historic Environment Information Resources for conservation, research, learning and general interest.

This includes concepts widely used for indexing relating to monument types, archaeological events and time periods. 

The significance is that previously the vocabulary providers lacked the ability to facilitate uniquely identified semantic indexing of data. Major thesauri can act as vocabulary hubs for the Web of Data (as suggested by W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group). For example, the availability of the Thesaurus of Monument Terms in this way is seen as a major development for the ADS archive metadata Linked Data (ADS Blog). This Linked Data publication of the English Heritage thesauri is a significant development in their vocabulary standards practice and their information access strategy. 

The potential reach is wide since it is a core activity of ADS, English Heritage, The Royal Commissions on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland/Wales to promote and disseminate best practice to the heritage sectors, as well as providing guidance on appropriate data standards including thesauri. The linked data vocabularies and web services will be integrated into the widely used ADS reporting/archiving tool, OASIS, which is in near universal use by commercial and local government archaeologists. Adoption of linked data based vocabulary management in this tool will immediately affect how all sectors engage in archaeological field practice and development control planning.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>217AF291-2D8B-4EA5-8DD5-62DD7DB3488F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Increasingly, archaeologists are looking to open digital collections and databases, previously confined to specialists, to a wider audience via the Web. It is difficult using conventional search engines to link these richly structured datasets or to search them using terminology other than that employed by the authors. Important archaeological reports are also appearing as 'grey literature' . Typically these are not indexed or made available for searching other than as ordinary Web documents. 

The STAR Project (Semantic Technologies for Archaeological Resources) is a collaboration between the Hypermedia Research Unit of the University of Glamorgan and English Heritage. Many archaeologists are familiar with detailed searches within single project datasets but currently such databases exist as isolated universes. A key aim is to show archaeologists new possibilities for broadening such searches, linking datasets and grey literature. The current situation within English Heritage and the archaeology domain generally is one of fragmented datasets and applications, with different terminology systems. Different datasets may employ different schema for semantically equivalent information. Entities may have different names but refer to the same underlying concept. The interpretation of a find (or free text report of an excavation) may not employ the same terms as the underlying dataset. Similarly searchers from different scientific perspectives may not use the same terminology. 

The aim of the STAR project is to address these concerns by utilising semantic terminology tools to link digital archive databases, vocabularies and the associated grey literature, exploiting the potential of a high level, core ontology and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The main outcome is a Research Demonstrator that cross searches over excavation datasets from different database schemas (and providers), including Raunds Roman, Raunds Prehistoric, Museum of London, Silchester Roman (IADB) and Stanwick sampling. The Demonstrator also searches across an extract of excavation reports from the OASIS index of grey literature, operated by the Archaeology Data Service. Cross search was previously not possible; each dataset remained in its own ghetto and no link was made to grey literature. 

The Demonstrator employs Semantic Web data representations and semantic search methods. It employs terminology resources, such as thesauri and an overarching ontology. The cultural heritage sector often employs Knowledge

Organization Systems, such as thesauri, for indexing. However, the full potential of these knowledge resources in online environments has not been tapped. Ontologies offer a high level domain conceptualisation with formal definition of roles and semantic relationships. Within cultural heritage, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) is emerging as a standard core ontology. In order to supply an umbrella framework to integrate different datasets and thesauri, English Heritage have designed a core ontology (the CRM-EH), extending the CRM with key archaeological concepts and relationships. The Demonstrator seeks to hide the complexity of the underlying ontology. As the user selects from the interface, an underlying semantic query is automatically constructed in terms of the corresponding ontological entities. 

Various other outcomes have resulted. STAR NLP techniques have annotated OASIS grey literature reports as XML documents, drawing on the CRM-EH core ontology and vocabularies. Terminology Web services allow access to English Heritage (National Monuments Record) thesauri, via a variety of (browser neutral) user interface widgets. The intellectual work of mapping the different datasets to the core ontology was assisted by a STAR mapping and data extraction tool. 

The outcomes have relevance beyond the immediate digital archaeology focus to cultural heritage more generally.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>See follow on STELLAR, SENESCHAL and ARIADNE projects</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4CC01D2D-D3F0-45E1-A826-1CC7D1B2D8CA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://hypermedia.research.southwales.ac.uk/kos/star/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The SENESCHAL outcomes have contributed to current initiatives by EH and others for a collaborative heritage sector information management information access strategy (TACOS).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>96A71C9B-A8B4-4853-8514-185B2D8F4AD5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://fishforum.weebly.com/tacos.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>SENESCHAL project case study features in the Scottish Government Open Data resource pack,developed to support Scotland's Open Data Strategy which was published in February 2015.
