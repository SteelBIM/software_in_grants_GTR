However, because exploitation is at such an early stage, there needs to be some form of proven platform technology before industry would feel confident about moving into the area. 

Through the PHYCONET network we to aim to to tackle this issue head on, by creating the critical mass of expertise, effort and focus needed to achieve the step-change and make the UK a leading player in algal biotechnology. This will benefit a wide range of IB sectors that have interest in natural bio-products, including the pharmaceuticals, nutraceuticals, comestics, food and biofuel industries.

Government and Public Bodies will also benefit, since the outputs of the network can have an impact on several pressing current issues: building the knowledge economy will lead to inward investment and wealth creation, and contribute to sustainable economic growth, improve security of food and materials, and contribute to enhanced nutrition. 
The outreach activities aim to increase awareness of the public on issues of natural products and the bio-based economy, energy, food and material security, and how the development of IB and a knowledge economy can benefit the UK. This will encourage pupils to adopt a career in science and technology, and policy makers to promote research investment into the microalgal IB sector.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>562418</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PHYCONET workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE9A1010-9EAE-4F02-87BD-261BCBDEEA65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PHYCONET showcase workshop to highlight R&amp;amp;D opportunities fin industrial biotechnology relating to high value products from microalgae.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.phyconet.org.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NIBB workshop (joint between IBCARB and PHYCONET)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0B83F676-BBCA-441F-8027-A56518CA57EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking meeting attended by ~80 members from industry, academia and other stakeholders.

Commencing in January 2014 and operating over the course of five years, the focus of PHYCONET is on producing high value products from microalgae (including cyanobacteria) industrially cultivated in an intensive and controlled manner using photobioreactor and fermentor-based technologies. currently we have over 500 members for academia and industry together with other stakeholders.

Our main objectives are to:

Develop an interdisciplinary microalgal research community in the UK
Network with international algal groups
Facilitate collaborative research between academia and industry
Provide funding for research projects within the network remit
Promote other funding opportunities
Organise conferences and networking and training events
Provide input to UK and EU policy
Promote the profile of microalgal research in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We catalyse new R&amp;amp;D collaborations between academia and industry through our network activities and our funding awards.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>49977054-4B58-4F78-937B-86F06389AD72</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.phyconet.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of BBSRC Bioenergy review panel</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D8003E6D-21D5-4A61-ADE6-CCDCA32F724A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L013789/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19C5179C-0522-47E8-82DA-48583B56264E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>5BA89E2C-27FE-4553-819B-3CE27FC71EC2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
