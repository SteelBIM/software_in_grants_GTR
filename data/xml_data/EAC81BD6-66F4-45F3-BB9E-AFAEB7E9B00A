The aim is to detect new objects that enter their field of view, classify them (pedestrians or vehicles, in the latter case, the type of vehicle), follow their trajectories and ultimately infer their intent.With advances in computing, networking and sensor technologies, surveillance systems are becoming more pervasive and sophisticated.A recent example is the Cambridge Transport Information Monitoring Environment which aims to monitor and improve the efficiency of the public transport infrastructure in Cambridge, e.g. by predicting the onset of congestion on roads and reschedule services as necessary.If current trends persist, it is likely that the amount of such data that is collected will only increase in years to come and developing efficient statistical methods for analysing it will continue to be an important challenge.This project aims to develop a flexible and robust methodology for Bayesian inferencefor multi-object tracking to meet the demands of existing and theever-increasing complexity of new applications.It will consider the computational and statisticalaspects of the problem and the developed methodology will be applied primarily to a new application area, namely Single Molecule Fluo-rescence Microscopy (SMFM).SMFM is an emerging area of study in Biology which is contributing tothe quantitative understanding of the fundamental processes in living cells.Experimentation techniques are advanced but the statisticalanalysis of the data, which is needed to support the scientific investigations, has not been addressed. The multi-object tracking framework is ideally suited to this application and our developed computational methodology will be specialized for it.In the methodological work, we will consider issues of generic and practical importance. Currently,there are three main challenges which will be addressed in this project. The first is computing the complex posterior probability distribution from which all inference is to be based.Getting the right answer to the practitioner's problem rests on a comprehensive solution for this problemwhich is presently unavailable. This proposal aims systematically address this using Monte Carlo as a primarymeans for computation.The second is calibrating the statistical models in multi-object tracking which are complex and have many tunable parameters.This problem is important as analysis based on models that are not properly calibrated will yieldincorrect results but unfortunately has received very little attention.The third is model assessment, which involves determining whether or not a proposed model adequately fits the data, and determining whether or not different models would be more suitable.In multi-object tracking, the data structures and the models are complex and routine methods for Bayesian model assessment cannot be immediately applied. A dedicated set of diagnostic tools need to be developed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>290844</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Science and Technology Facilities Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Harwell</gtr:department><gtr:description>Bayesian Tracking for Single molecule imaging</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A1F1C00-3AF2-419B-961D-2090429D9DF5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>New software platform for tracking in single molecule imaging.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>My partners are developing the live cell imaging technique and designing/conducting the single molecule experiments.

The broad aim of this project was to develop a flexible and robust Statistical methodology for joint tracking and model calibration.

New Monte Carlo Bayesian method have been developed as a complete solution to the problem of tracking and model calibration and have been shown to be robust and outperform existing techniques. These new methods have been applied to Single Molecule imaging and are able to work with the raw images to avoid any potential loss of information - many existing tracking techniques pre-process the images to simplify the tracking task.

The work undertaken in this grant also has a broader appeal in Statistics. This includes new theoretical results that underpin some recent advances in Monte Carlo methods for inference in complex statistical models.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0F62A656-5B01-49D0-B78A-B734B0097DEA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Multi-object (or Multi-target) tracking (MTT) concerns the analysis of data from multiple moving objects, which are only partially observed in noise, to extract accurate motion trajectories. The broad aim of this project was to develop a flexible and robust Statistical methodology for this purpose.

The project aimed to address the following specific challenges in MTT and each of these itemised below constitutes a significant achievements from the grant:

1) There is a large body of work on the development of algorithms for tracking multiple moving targets however, the problem of calibrating the MTT model has been largely neglected and no complete study of it was available. One of the main objectives of the proposal was to address this and we have successfully devised several new algorithms for joint tracking and model calibration.

a) We have proposed what appears to be the first Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for calibrating the MTT model. The EM algorithm is widely used in Statistics and surprisingly it had not been developed for the MTT model. The most appealing aspect of this new algorithm is its simplicity, its sequential nature, and its ability be be integrated into most existing online algorithms for tracking multiple moving targets that do not calibrate the model.

b) The EM algorithm is not designed for so called non-linear and non-Gaussian MTT models and one of the major aims was to develop a flexible and robust Bayesian methodology for MTT and model calibration. To accomplish this aim we have devised new Bayesian Monte Carlo algorithms and we have shown in detailed numerical studies that our new methods out performs existing techniques in terms of accuracy of the results.


2) A primary application area of the project was Single Molecule Fluourescence Microscopy (SMFM) or single molecule imaging. SMFM is a high-resolution live cell imaging technique based on tracking fluorescence-labeled biomolecules within the cell. We have further developed our Bayesian Monte Carlo tracking algorithms to work with the raw images from the single molecule imaging technique to avoid the potential loss of information of the conventional approach that pre-processes the images to extract &amp;quot;point observations.&amp;quot; We are also able to calibrate the model for the application and numerically assess the appropriateness of the model for the application.

3) It was anticipated that the work undertaken in this grant would have a broader appeal and impact in Statistics. We would like to emphasise two other significant outcomes of this proposal that have contributed to the advancement of Monte Carlo methods for inference in complex high-dimensional statistical.

a)The first concerns Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which is a new rapidly advancing area of research in Computational Statistics for complex statistical models.
Although ABC had become a popular technique for inference when the likelihood function of the statistical model is analytically intractable (e.g. MTT models) there was no complete investigation of the theoretical properties of the resulting estimators. We pioneered a theoretical analysis of the asymptotic properties of ABC based parameter estimators for hidden Markov models and showed that ABC based estimators satisfy asymptotically biased versions of the standard results in the statistical literature, such as consistency, asymptotic normality and posterior contraction.

b) Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is an exciting new development where a particle filter is used as an efficient proposal distribution within a MCMC algorithm to sample the posterior distribution of a time-series model. In a first theoretical study of Particle MCMC we prove it is uniformly ergodic, which explains its excellent performance observed by us within an MTT context, and by other researchers for non-MTT applications.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our work on model calibration for MTT has already been attracting attention in the MTT literature with more papers now explicitly addressing this aspect of the problem in new ways.

Our robust Bayesian methodology for MTT and model calibration will undoubtedly be of interest for Single Molecule studies since it is the first complete Bayesian solution to the tracking and model calibration problem and indeed could serve as a benchmark against which other techniques, that compromise accuracy for speed of execution, could be compared. We also feel there is significant scope to speed up our method by using parallel processing architecture and experts in this field of computation could contribute.

Our work on ABC has been well received (citations and research talk invitations) and has and will continue to seed more studies on the theoretical properties of the technique.

Our work on PMCMC has already been extended by some authors to obtain a more refined estimate on the uniform ergodicity bound.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4A9F98D6-80CB-4D7F-9D0A-C59E46ADA5FD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Financial Services, and Management
