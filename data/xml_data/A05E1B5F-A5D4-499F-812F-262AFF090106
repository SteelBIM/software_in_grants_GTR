Ageing results in the decline of both physical and cognitive abilities and the most widespread cognitive decline is a reduction in memory ability. Recent research has found that when information is consistent with an individual?s knowledge and experience, it is easier to remember than abstract information and older adults appear to benefit from this effect more than do young adults. For example, when people are asked to remember an association between two words, age differences in memory performance are smaller for related word pairs (article-book, &amp;nbsp;fatigue-sleep) &amp;nbsp;compared to unrelated word pairs (article-lapel, &amp;nbsp;fatigue-glass). It may therefore be possible to improve memory, particularly for older adults, by encouraging individuals to use knowledge and information that they are familiar with to support memory processes. The project will use a range of memory tests to investigate how people can use knowledge about the world to distinguish between different information in memory during retrieval; improve the chances of thinking in the same way when encoding information and when retrieving information; and reduce the amount of effort required to successfully encode and retrieve information.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this research will be academics working in the field of cognitive science. The main focus of the project is to highlight how pre-existing knowledge (familiarity) is used by individuals in memory tasks. The outcome will be to draw distinctions between the processing of familiar information and novel information. Processing of familiar and novel information occurs almost continuously in everyday life and therefore has widespread implications across many areas of psychology, neuroscience, gerontology and medicine. The key aim of the project is to provide foundation and guidance to future research by identifying fundamental aspects of cognition.

The most widespread impact of this research will be based on insights gained into methods for alleviating age deficits in memory. Through the research we will learn more about how pre-existing knowledge can reduce age deficits in memory. This information will be valuable to academics and medical practitioners seeking to extend the independence of older adults with declining mental health caused by dementia. For example, one possible implementation of pre-existing knowledge may be for older adults to establish a routine for their daily activities such as taking medication, maintaining hygiene, preparing meals, and so on. The established routine will be a pre-existing concept and may support memory for completing individual daily tasks. Even if such techniques only improve older adults' memory slightly, they may allow individuals to retain independence for an extra few months into the onset of dementia. This will have a large, positive financial impact on individuals and the state and should improve the happiness and quality of life for older adults for this extra period of time.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242600</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Carnegie Mellon University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Aging and Memory as Discrimination: Influences of Encoding Specificity, Cue Overload, and Prior Knowledge</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DBDF5C2-ED2F-4F25-A855-986C9CC7F16F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An article under review.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The PI and CI have conducted and written up a study which is currently under review with the journal Psychology and Aging.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We have conducted research linking our ESRC grant to paradigms developed by Dr Marie Poirier with whom we have collaborated on a multi-experiment paper.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Warwick</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>An Empirical and Computational Study of Category Learning in Normal Human Ageing</gtr:description><gtr:id>6871B695-3CAE-490D-8F53-13B06E4B3A89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The proposal itself is currently under review.

The project led directly to a collaboration on a related grant proposal to ESRC, which received three &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot; ratings though was not funded. We are continuing to use data from the project to explore new avenues of research with colleagues both at Warwick and elsewhere in the hope of establishing a clearer image of cognitive ageing and to investigate means of helping older adults function successfully in life with diminishing cognitive resources.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DD3E1F15-39BB-4433-92A3-90AB1CEF5700</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key focus of the grant was to investigate how knowledge and experience can alleviate the deficits in memory associated with old age. It has often been found that older adults can perform much better in memory tasks that involve existing knowledge. For example, when memorising pairs of words, older adults improve more than young adults when the words within each pair are related (e.g., flashlight-candle, harp-piano) compared to unrelated (e.g., flashlight-piano, harp-candle) and this reduces the general age deficits found in memory.
Our research indicates that this widely accepted pattern does not always occur. Thus, we have found several circumstances in which knowledge and experience help young and older adults similarly (i.e., the two age groups benefit equally from prior knowledge in memory tasks). These seem to be when the prior knowledge is based on frequency of encounter. That is, things that have been frequently experienced are generally more easily remembered than things that are novel or new for all age groups.
As highlighted above, words that are related are more memorable, especially for older adults. This may be because the relations form part of a unified concept (e.g, harp and piano are both musical instruments). In our research, we found no age differences in the benefit of knowledge and experience on memory tasks when that experience was based on frequency. For example both age groups similarly remembered 'a man sitting on a bench' better than 'a man sitting on a wall', with the former being more commonly encountered. However, with sentences such as 'The teacher marked the mock exam papers' and 'The teacher caught the train to London', the age deficit in memory was much smaller for the former. Older adults seemed to particularly benefit from the logical relation between the parts of the sentence ('the teacher' and 'marked the mock exam papers') because the action is one that is mainly linked to being a teacher. In the prior example of 'a man sitting on a bench', there are many more things that a man might do, even if sitting on a bench is more common than sitting on a wall.
Overall, we have established circumstances that determine whether knowledge/experience has an equivalent or greater benefit for older adults compared to young adults. We have found evidence that prior knowledge may help memory in two dissociable ways: (1) by enhancing the encoding/storage/retrieval of the episodic memory itself, which helps both age groups equally; and (2) by providing extra strategic/logical support in addition to the memory trace itself, which is disproportionately beneficial to older adults relative to young adults.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The most immediate beneficiaries of this research will be academics working in the field of cognitive ageing (e.g., we already know of other labs that are following up our findings). Researchers are generally focussed on finding tasks that older adults can do well and tasks that older adults struggle with. This helps to classify cognitive processes that are spared or impaired, respectively, by cognitive ageing. Understanding age-related cognitive decline can benefit research in two ways. Firstly, it will allow researchers to pinpoint areas of the brain that are physiologically more susceptible to ageing (for example, by repeating the research in a neuroimaging study) and identify cognitive processes that are more susceptible to ageing. This will help to focus age-related palliative and preventative research on the most affected areas of age-related cognitive decline. Secondly, by highlighting processes that are most affected by ageing, the research may allow further insight into the most fragile cognitive processes. These fragile processes are likely to be the most complex or to be processes that require an ideal physiological environment in which to operate. This may also provide insight into understanding human behaviour and cognition in general (for example, processes less vital to survival may be more susceptible to failure).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5AB82981-530B-453B-9FF4-964DE9082486</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database contains raw data for the publications resulting from this award.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4A17C117-9C91-41B2-85E0-B975B3D71809</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Badham, S.
