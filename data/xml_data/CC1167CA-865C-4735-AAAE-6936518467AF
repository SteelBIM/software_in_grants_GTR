Network+</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K003585/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Rapid advances in digital technologies have converged with research in business, social science and humanities to dissolve the boundaries between disciplines, institutions and practices. The Digital Economy Communities and Culture Network+ (CCNetwork+) engages with transformations in these different streams of research, bringing them together with a wider public through direct engagements, innovative methods and digital resources. Advances in digital technologies have also brought about the transformation of cultural institutions such as libraries, museums, schools, media and arts centres, whose interactions with their users, researchers, and information 'itself', is increasingly digital. As a direct consequence, the notion of 'culture' as a static resource or located place is no longer tenable. A third transformation has been in the concept of 'community', as interest groups, social/political capital, and connectivity are mediated, produced and reconfigured in different ways through social and other digital media. These new and converging frontiers of knowledge and communication mark the CCNetwork+ as a timely and crucial intervention into a shifting digital landscape. 

Digital technologies are not just impacting on a meta level, however, they are also felt through everyday experiences. Digital technologies have become so embedded into our daily lives that it is impossible to imagine daily interactions without them. Cultural and social exchanges now occur through mobile devices; personal and cultural artifacts are stored virtually rather than in particular places, and the products that circulate at greater speed and intensity are being read, downloaded and appropriated in new and innovative ways. The successful user of digital technology is now posing real critical questions in terms of civic engagement, investment in community, or even a wider social or political efficacy. Pervasive media and technology means that these wider shifts are no longer based on-screen but are integrated into everyday life and the very fabric of urban and rural environments and institutions. At a policy level, the ubiquity of digital technologies have sparked a range of reactive legislation that attempts to deal with the fast pace of information flows, concerns about intellectual property, and copyright issues. 

The impacts brought on by the convergence of digital technology, culture, and practice raise real questions around how and what communities and cultures might/could/should be understood. Indeed, when our everyday experiences are seen in conjunction with the industrial, social, on-the ground and policy responses to the digital economy, it is clear that digital technologies are changing forever how we understand and engage in community and culture. Despite the speed and intensity of digital transformation that has marked our lives on every level, it is vital that we do more than simply react to it if we are to understand, and shape, changes that are determining culture and community in profound ways. 

The CCNetwork+ Project is designed to facilitate this. It is an ambitious intervention into a landscape marked by fast pace and innovative technologies. We aim to produce creative and response led activities that directly speak to the speed and scope of digital technological change while simultaneously critically interrogating it. Working with the communities and cultures to which and through which we speak, and using a range of methods including action research, critical investigation, sociological analysis, co-production (crowd source/public knowledge projects), pilot technology and code projects, we will directly intervene in policy initiatives, shape practice, refigure the moral and ethical issues of this environment, and identify dangers, risks, opportunities and evolutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The DE 'Communities and Culture' Network+ will impact onto policy, the creative and cultural industries, the wider public, media and education, and will leave a lasting legacy in the Digital Economy theme. It will impact onto the communities and cultures it engages with, including communities in need, third sector organisations, small, local, national and global businesses, the public sector and cultural institutions. 
 
The impact strategy for the CCNetwork+ Project is embedded into the research itself: every activity within the CCNetwork+ will have demonstrable impact. As each activity will be both cross-disciplinary and involve communities and industries through close collaboration, such impact will have breadth and depth. The communities and cultures we engage with will all benefit directly from the discrete-but-connected activities, specifically through exchanges of good practice, knowledge, skills and people. The activities themselves will produce innovative responses to specific and tangible needs, directly benefitting the communities and cultures each activity works with. The response-mode allocation of research budgets allows for a high level of response to a fast paced digital environment, in turn producing quality interventions and responses that are pertinent and profound. The findings and exchanges will feed back into the CCNetwork+ as a whole, forging new avenues for research and identifying key and emerging research areas. 

In conjunction with the specific activities, the DE 'Communities and Culture' Network+ also has a range of impact strategies at a meta level that will consolidate the research of the activities themselves into a cohesive and powerful narrative. Our workshops, events, entrepreneur days and public events (that will form one element of the output for discrete projects) all aim to directly address the different communities we engage with, from academics, to small businesses and entrepreneurs, to the communities and cultures themselves. These events are underpinned by a virtual presence that will consolidate and disseminate the findings, grow a community of expertise, develop agendas and share expertise. Along with tangible fact sheets and policy reports that will target key individuals and groups such as local government, policy makers, and communities of practice, we will generate a real awareness of the CCNetwork+ thus ensuring a powerful position for further impact and intervention. This two-tier approach is both targeted and broad, and, along with the design of the project as a whole, will facilitate rapid responses to policy reports, think tanks, and community and culture needs.

Finally, open dialogue and communication with the existing DE and AHRC Hubs and the subthemes within the DE Challenge Areas offers wider and deeper impact potential as we consolidate findings, extend research avenues and construct an international network of expertise around the theme of digital transformations. Along with the three other DE Challenge Areas, this means that the grand challenges across the entire spectrum of society will be identified in order to plan and shape future areas.

1) What can we learn from the actual experiences of the Biospheric Foundation in relation to building community capacity and resilience in local food production, supply, distribution and waste systems?
2) How do these lessons inform our understanding of potential responses to food austerity and the actual and potential roles of digital transformations?
The work focussed on a retrospective and prospective analysis of the development of the Biospheric Foundation in the context of digital transformations. It also involved four community conversations with technologists, food poverty groups, residents and academics. A two-day community research jam was held to co-produce a Digital Action Plan for the Biospheric Foundation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Museum of English Rural Life - MERL</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Creating a Virtual Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>D23CD335-AA28-4043-BA42-6BF6E2F8F741</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The majority of the MERL buildings were modelled along with nine objects. These ranged in size, shape and materials to test the digital scanning technologies, and were chosen for their appeal to school age children. 

The finished model was demonstrated at two events, one for museum staff and volunteers, and another to groups of children at a local school. At each of these events, three formats of the model were available to experience: iPad, PC monitor, and Oculus Rift headset, alongside four of the objects scanned into the model and brought from MERL. Around 80 people attended the two events and were able to experience the VR models, and provide feedback, thoughts and comments on their experience. 

Teaching: The MERL model and the techniques used to create it were used as the main teaching example in a one week module for MSc students from the School of the Built Environment at the University of Reading - 'Advanced visualization and interactive technologies'. Twelve students produced their own 3D models using photogrammetry, and four students have taken this research as the starting point for their individual projects. The feedback was universally positive, especially the new 'hands-on' approach this project allowed.

Software Development: Revizto, the software used to bring together the various parts of the model (architecture, objects and additional information) and make it navigable, heard of the project through Twitter and contacted IE to write a case study and suggest ways the software could be developed to suit this type of application. The context for the case study was the re-purposing of the software from a building information management tool, to a visitor experience. This went live on their website (https://revizto.com/en/blog/entry/university-of-reading-merl) in October 2015.

Further Funding:
An AHRC grant was awarded to IE for a new 12 month project: 'Sensations of Roman Life' beginning March 2016. This will build on this project to create a VR Roman house, but including sounds and smells, to be displayed at Chedworth House - a National Trust managed Roman villa complex.
An AHRC PhD studentship was awarded to IE/CH for a project devised in association with Historic England, to start in October 2016. This will use a highly accurate 3D model as the basis for a data management system to allow heritage professionals to document and manage their built assets, and provide visitors with a more informed experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Reading provided 20% funding

Digitalisation is a key aspect of Welfare Reform and central to the new Universal Credit (UC) system being rolled out gradually across the country with an original target of 80% of claimants making and managing their UC benefit claims online by 2017.
This research focused on three specific communities of interest: public administrators of welfare; frontline welfare law advisors; and welfare claimants. Our research questions explored the potential impacts of an austerity-driven digital welfare system on these different communities and welfare systems, and on the everyday relationships between claimants and welfare providers. 



While evidence grows about the financial and legal impacts of welfare changes, the cultural and community implications of this new welfare system and its digital character are far less well evidenced and understood. This pilot project will explore this uncertain landscape of a digitally transformed welfare system for our three specific stakeholder groups through a partnership that builds on existing pro bono research collaborations between the School of Geography (SoG), Leeds City Council (LCC), and the Advice Leeds Partnership of public and voluntary sector advice services (see Letters of Support).</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Games for Communication</gtr:description><gtr:id>7FF1FD51-B59D-46AE-94E9-DA0986C189AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Barr, M.

The organisations invited to participate were: Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Council; AllSorts (LGBT youth); MindOut LGBT mental health); Broken Rainbow (Domestic Violence &amp;amp; Abuse); Terrence Higgins Trust (Black &amp;amp; Minority Ethnic service users); GiFi - Commercial software development; Projekt - Swedish HIV/AIDS prevention; Albert Kennedy Trust (vulnerable LGBT Youth); Health &amp;amp; Inclusion Project (community research organisation); Birmingham CCG (primary care); Positive East (BME Community); MHealth Habitat.
In October 2014, Dr Mowlabocus was presented the project's findings to the staff of GeoSpock in Cambridge, UK. GeoSpock is a technology start-up that has developed a more secure method of using GPS software than that currently used by app developers. Dr Mowlabocus was able to provide GeoSpok with a presentation that matched up the research findings of the original project with some of the aims and objectives of GiFi. Following the meeting, Dr Mowlabocus has acted as a liaison point between GeoSpock and Terrence Higgins Trust, both of whom are now in discussions regarding a possible future collaboration.
- Dr Mowlabocus was invited to run two events for Brighton &amp;amp; Hove LGBT Switchboard - one community forum and one service provider workshop - with the aim of disseminating findings of the research and identifying further concerns that community members had regarding these heavily used technologies.
- Mowlabocus was the keynote speaker at the annual gay men's health conference organised in Stockholm by RFSL, one of the oldest LGBT
organisations in the world.
- In January 2015, Dr Mowlabocus was the lead presenter and a co-facilitator at an MHealth Habitat workshop in Leeds.
- In October 2014, Dr Mowlabocus acted as a consultant to the Albert Kennedy Trust. Dr Mowlabocus was able to talk through some of the key principles of digital outreach work and, at the present time, the two parties are in ongoing discussions regarding a future training event for new staff.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>During the course of the research, further funding was secured (from Terrence Higgins Trust) to undertake a complimentary piece of work that focused on MSM4 users of digital media.

Terrence Higgins Trust, also secured funding from from the European Centre for Disease Control (?25,000) to undertake a pan-European scoping study that built upon the methodologies employed and findings identified in the Reaching out online.

THT's Justin Harbottle Justin acted as the non-HEI project collaborator on this research. He brought to the project a wealth of expertise in the fields of sexual health and online health promotion. He also acted as a liaison between the partner institutions and played a direct role in shaping the research methods and identifying the findings. He was also be responsible for stakeholder recruitment and services buy-in.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This pilot project builds upon the CCN+ Expertise and Knowledge scoping study, and develops an existing research relationship between the University of Sussex and the Terrence Higgins Trust (THT), the UK's oldest HIV prevention charity and a member of Health Promotion England (HPE), a newly formed consortium charged with delivering HIV prevention work to targeted 'at-risk' communities. The research speaks to some of the aims of HPE and will help to shape a key element of the intervention strategies being designed to support the health and wellbeing of gay men and men who have sex with men (MSM).

Specifically, the research examines the use of online social media tools and platforms by outreach workers during sexual health interventions targeted at gay male and MSM communities. The development of social media platforms has recently contributed to a reframing of health promotion work, particularly where at-risk communities are identified as having particular investments in online social/sexual networking practices. This project feeds into the original scoping study identified above by exploring the methods and consequences of delivering sexual health knowledge and expertise via digital platforms.

Follow-on funding was awarded to this CCN+ pilot study in 2014 to undertake targeted dissemination work in order to explore opportunities for knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Space2</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>In/visible and un/fixed Communities: Living with the Welfare Reforms</gtr:description><gtr:id>C5821F49-18E8-4AA9-879B-5979CB4D191E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisciplinary: Media, ethnography, arts
The project has had an important amount of impact items reaching several stakeholders.
Here are some of the most important:
1. Media and local policy visibility for young people's voices and ideas. With MyMap Leeds this was underpinned by the CBBC, the City Council and several stakeholders that used social media to discuss and support the project. This was positive not only for the Studio and participating children but served as a public example of joint projects between university and government. 
2. The shooting of a short documentary, following the ethnographic work with Studio12. This documentary was produced to support the three films completed by the young people. This documentary, along with the films, were screened to city authorities and representatives from local media industries and later became part of the BBCFresh webpage and screened in different festivals around the world.
3. Space2 edited together a series of audiovisual materials. Outputs include a film - a taster has been shown as part of West Yorkshire Playhouse's Recipe for Life event, and a screening of the complete material that was part of one of the participants Art Award Activities. These were showcased at a number of third sector and community sector events including at the West Yorkshire Playhouse, to achieve local recognition. These events were attended by local residents, council members, community arts organizations, industry, and representatives of key services (social services, police, job centres, NHS).
4. The event Tea, Cake and Conversation co-organized by the CCN+ and Space2,
reunited council members, scholars and families of Space 2 participants who are
living on benefits to discuss some of the facing challenges in everyday life- It
became an important forum to bridge two groups that are usually disengaged. This event constituted a key methodological prototype we are currently developing whereby creative methods are used as a starting point for political discussion.
5. Helen Thornham, PI of the project, has been engaging in a number of local policy initiatives and working with Leeds Council Third Sector Organisations and Industry on the digital policy of the city. She has also written a number of articles for the Conversation, which have resulted in invitations across the disciplinary sectors for research project involvement and research projects outside academia.

As part of this larger project, one 18 month work package, designed in collaboration with Leeds organisation Space2, seeks to understand the lived engagements with the reforms as they fundamentally shift domestic and leisure power relations, identity and lived realities of communities and individuals. Space2 is a third sector organisation working with disenfranchised populations around Leeds: the nearly homeless, NEET individuals, immigrants, and those whose local communities are seen to be increasingly precarious as a result of the reforms.

The Welfare Reform project aims to fulfill our academic concerns whilst also actively contributing to Space2?s goals to: build confidence; develop creative thinking and responsibility; and encourage commitment and investment. In order to contribute to these latter goals we will host workshops at Leeds University, engage local facilitators from Space2, digital media experts and film-makers in order to contribute to a widening of horizons for the project participants.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Kent</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Capturing the lived experience of food bank clients and volunteers</gtr:description><gtr:id>DB5A1E4B-E076-489B-9B48-AAC45CC0490E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic impact

Impact of the project has been mainly limited to the project workshop so far as the empirical analysis has just been completed. The workshop, which was attended by 26 organisations, included presentations from small non-profit organisations as well as their stakeholders about their experiences with and views about social media adoption. It also provided a forum to disseminate initial findings of the project and discuss opportunities as well as issues around social media use in small non-profit organisations. The workshop included activities around identifying and ranking support mechanisms and policy initiatives in relation to social media adoption in the third sector. At the end of the event 94% of participants agreed that the content was relevant, 83% said that they were likely to adapt ideas from the workshop in their organisation, and 88% said that they would like to attend similar workshops in the future. Qualitative feedback from the workshop included:
&amp;quot;Thank-you for allowing me to enhance my knowledge around social media. This has enabled me to have an informed decision regarding how we promote social media in our organisation in the future. I walked in this morning with reservations about social media and will walk away converted to the benefits so thank-you!&amp;quot; (Workshop delegate) 
&amp;quot;This is a great resource for small organisations. It's accessible and the content was very relevant.&amp;quot; (Workshop delegate) 
&amp;quot;Very informative and prompted some good discussion.&amp;quot; (Workshop delegate) 
Developing impact is key in taking the study forward. There are two immediate plans. First, the PI is developing a KE project that aims to develop support for small non-profit organisations in relation to social media adoption. Building on findings of this project it will co-design with relevant stakeholders support mechanisms that were identified as most useful and monitor their effectiveness. The KE project, which will be supported by the Centre for Research on Communities and Cultures at the School of Media, Art and Design, Canterbury Christ Church University, aims to develop the impact of the study by informing and enabling organisations in the third sector. 
Second, the project findings are informing the design of another study the PI is embarking on about local communication and news online. A strand of this research is exploring local communication in relation to third sector organisations in the community and this will build on some of the findings of the project. Apart from these two immediate next steps the PI also aims to develop a next phase for the study which would explore tensions around and the hybrid nature of social media use in the third sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided funding at 20%.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This seed project aimed to explore to what extent the transformative potentials of digital technologies, in particular social media, are being realised in relation to community volunteering.

This seed project will uses multi-touch digital facilities at the Digital Humanities Hub, University of Birmingham, to test the ways in which Surrealism translates to multi-cultural community groups recruited from Balsall Heath, the proposed site of a dedicated surrealist heritage museum. Birmingham Surrealist Laboratory will host two workshops with surrealist materials which can be thematically or visually grouped by participants in myriad ways. Interactive elements will be combined with information on surrealism and how the concept has been explored in different artistic mediums and cultural contexts. Informing innovative issues of cultural education and the avant-garde in a diverse city, the project data will also feed into wider research on how participants map meaning from digital interfaces in heritage and museum spaces. It builds upon existing community relationships developed as part of Cultural Intermediation [AH/J005320/1] and the Balsall Heath Biennale (see Section B.2 Glossary). Culminating in a roundtable format discussion, it will draw community participants, cultural sector workers and multi-disciplinary academics to ask new research questions on complex issues of cultural transmission and cultural sensitivity in the legacy of Surrealism in Birmingham, and its wider global movements.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biosperic Foudation CIC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Putting Foodbanks out of Business</gtr:description><gtr:id>3729C339-0343-4CBD-B3AE-E3C09E664F70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The impact of this pilot project was built in as the primary intended outcome (the Digital Action Plan).

Impact
Overall, this study offers findings and insights that could usefully pave the way for a larger scale examination of the employment of digital technologies and tools in social research in the UK. Notwithstanding of the seed nature of the study, one could argue that:
1. The study sheds some light on the use of digital technologies in social research and highlights the parameters of complexity (e.g., level and quality of technology and/or its use); multiplicity (e.g., single or multiple technologies and/or uses); research timing (e.g., when technologies are used in the multi-staged research process); literacy (e.g., researchers' digital skills as well as the availability of associated resources and support); and the importance of technology for the impact, inter-disciplinarity and future prospects of research. This way, the study can inform the broader social research community in the country and trigger reflections on the rise of a digital research community with a distinct research culture. The findings could constitute the ground for conversations between researchers, research funders and technology experts on existing patterns of use of digital technologies in social research and associated opportunities and challenges.
2. The study offers insights into past 'failures' and current insufficiencies, pointing to lessons for researchers in the country. These are lessons such as:
o the need to consult with other researchers and the broader scholarly community within and outside strict disciplinary boundaries in order to exchange knowledge and learn from each other's experiences;
o the value of considering the needs and culture of the broader (non-scholarly) community and the 'target audience' of the research in order to develop a better understanding of how to best communicate research through technological means;
o the importance of providing funders, research institutions and universities with recommendations on research capacity development and associated training and support provision.
3. This study provides universities and research institutions in the UK with feedback on the need for bespoke support and for a departure from the currently generic and 'one-size-fits-all' training provision. The study also points to the need for research institutions to conduct awareness-raising initiatives that will inform the research community on innovative research in general and on the benefits that come from the employment of digital technologies in research in particular.

Dissemination
The findings of the study will be disseminated through various means and activities in order to inform the broader research community in the UK as well as to pave the way for a follow-up, larger scale study.
Specifically, the present report will be disseminated to the broader research community in the UK through the Joint Information Systems Committee, the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the National Centre for Research Methods (NCRM). The preliminary results of the study were presented at the European Communication Research and Education Association (ECREA) Fifth European Communication Conference in Lisbon (12-15 November 2014) and at the Communities and Culture Network+ (CCN+) annual event at the University of Leeds (12-13 December 2014), while a line-up of conference and workshop presentations is being planned for 2015. The study will lead to the production of three peer-reviewed journal articles (journals under consideration: Information, Communication &amp;amp; Society; International Journal of Social Research Methodology; New Media &amp;amp; Society; Qualitative Research; Studies in Qualitative Methodology). Also, the findings of the study will be presented and discussed at a dissemination and engagement workshop in autumn 2015 that will involve members of the social research community, funding bodies and technology experts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Leicester provided funding at 20%.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This pilot study explores the employment of digital tools, resources and services by the social research community in the UK and from the stage of designing the research through to data collection and dissemination of results.

Since this project is only a preliminary exploration, the impact at this stage is limited, and is likely to occur primarily as the outcome of the larger study, for which the seed project is preparing. The expected areas of impact include:
- contribution to scholarly knowledge and theoretical innovation
- engagement with the community to address issues of digital freedom and coercion and explore the possibilities of collective digital refusal; and to explore what kind of services can be offered to support digital disengagement. The larger study is expected to produce research of high social impact, by focusing on the following questions: 
How can collective action change the dominating forms of digital media use?
What forms of activism / what organisational structures are most effective in doing this?
What services are needed to support those wishing to reduce their use of digital tools?
What expertise is required for such services to be effective?</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>MMU provided funding at 20%</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The initial seed project consisted of three components: surveying the emerging online social discourses of digital disengagement (news articles, magazines, blogs, business and organisational sites); carrying out an exploratory ethnography with two participants who actively volunteered to discuss their perceptions and lived experiences of disengagement; and finally, bringing the first and second components together and developing a conceptual map, a typology of disengagement. Overall, the study identifies different types of social groups and individuals who choose digital disengagement, common reasons and motivations behind digital disengagement, and how these acts of digital disengagement are practiced in everyday life with political, social, and economical consequences. These relate to concerns regarding social relations and privacy; finance and economy; health and well-being; ecology; and education. 

The follow-on project consisted of two key components corresponding to our main areas of interest. In Part 1 we document, map and review the different organisations dedicated to collective forms of digital disengagement. In particular, we focus on two initiatives, 'National Day of Unplugging' (US) and 'National Unplugging Day' (UK), conducting initial textual and visual analyses of these projects' websites. Part 2 documents, maps and reviews the different businesses, experts and services offering commercialised and corporate forms of digital disengagement. Here, we focus on a particular London-based digital life-coaching service - 'Consciously Digital' - through qualitative analysis of the company website alongside an interview with its founder and activing manager, Anastasia Dediykhina.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Studio12</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Studio12</gtr:description><gtr:id>29421B22-5220-4A18-B9F7-D5F2768AB0A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Three 'Writing Britain' films, now available on the BBC Fresh website.

Studio12 provides free access to a production studio, training, accredited qualifications and professional guidance in design, music, video and media arts, for Leeds residents aged 16-30. Together with Edgar they intend to engage schools, NGOs and social organisations in a practical workshop on how to create small video-pieces. The resulting works will be used to create a map of Leeds voices .

Alongside these activities Edgar will be developing his own ethnographic study into how young people learn, engage, develop, use and integrate digital technologies into their everyday practices, especially those related to creativity and audio-visual production.

The collaboration will facilitate a study into how young people learn, engage, develop, use and integrate digital technologies in everyday practices. It has the potential to illuminate how digital culture is shaping and being shaped by everyday practices and may help us to understand how practices of looking, politics of vision and creative production of media can (or not) be vehicles for the development of citizenship, participation and democracy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mobilising Cultural Nationalism</gtr:description><gtr:id>FE270135-C53A-442F-B59F-D689C45A3D5E</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>This project will look at how arts communities mobilise in favour of Scottish independence through examination of the structure, message and method of communications used. The academic and political debate surrounding the Scottish independence referendum tends to be focused upon the economic, fiscal and democratic processes involved in choosing either to remain within a ?union of four nations? or to become a politically independent unit. However, there is extensive work being done online, in person and through grassroots efforts to define the type of nation the people of Scotland would like to build ? whether with a yes or a no vote. 



One prominent aspect of this discussion is about the creative industry in Scotland. Though government-funded organisations, such as Creative Scotland are attempting to remain neutral, there are a number of grass-roots organisations attempting to define the debate within the creative sector, whilst also using their creative talents to campaign. One of these groups, National Collective, has agreed to work with us on a new scoping project. Their work is presented on a website, Facebook page and very active twitter feed as well as across the independence activist network. There are photographic projects, comics, musical events, interviews, debates and now a full-length film. 



Our work will focus upon the structure of the collective, its position within the independence debate, interaction with other campaign groups, and discourse about nation, identity, and political action. We will begin with expert interviews with those identifying as the leaders of the organisation and with regular members to analyse whether there is a converging or diverging perception of the purpose of the community. Participant observation will be carried out at events ? both organisational and campaigning. Finally, we will analyse their website output and twitter network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Media and Communication</gtr:department><gtr:description>Online Action Networks</gtr:description><gtr:id>2B119E74-4AC3-4F22-838D-0571CD673A9B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Provided funding at 20%.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This study looks at the networked nature of political action online - investigating spaces of opinion formation, action fermentation, and end points of political action.

Throughout the project we have worked with the Scottish Youth Parliament. We have fed back the findings from the interviews with 16-19 year old first-time voters to MSYPs and discussed the findings with them. The outcomes of the discussions have been incorporated in our subsequent work. We have shared and discussed our overall research findings with the SYP. We have written a blog for Democratic Audit Scotland setting out some of the key findings of our research. Our findings are also being disseminated through a White Paper, which will be sent to each MP and MSP in Scotland. At different times in the project, we have issued two press releases which were reported on the BBC Scotland website3 and by the Press and Journal newspaper. Members of the team were also interviewed following each press release by BBC Radio Scotland and our research and parts of the interviews were reported on the news.
We are currently arranging an event to disseminate our research findings with the Scottish Parliament' Cross-Party Group on Children and Young People. The membership of this CPG includes not only Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) but representatives and members of the Scottish Youth Parliament and other organisations (e.g. YouthLink Scotland and Children in Scotland) that work with and represent young people. A further press release is about to be sent to media outlets in Scotland which will lead to the further dissemination of our findings. A local radio station, Northsound, has expressed an interest in reporting the final outcomes of our research.
On the academic front, we intend to present a conference paper to at least one, and possible two, academic conferences in spring/summer 2016.

A portable laser scanner will be used to capture a 3-D scan of Elgin Ladyhill/Castle in the North-East of Scotland. These are important local landmarks; the ruins of Elgin castle date back to the 12th century and stand at one end of the Royal Burgh High Street. The scan will be rendered using open source technologies and used as a basis for the social research. User engagement activities and social research interviews with members of the community will be conducted in Elgin Library. As well as investigating the user experience of viewing local heritage sites in a virtual environment, this pilot project will also investigate mechanisms for incorporating user-generated content into the visualisations. We believe that this can provide means through which non professional users can contribute information to these visualisations and thereby enhance knowledge and understanding through ?tagging? and commenting on digital artefacts (Basu, 2012).



This project addresses the key aspects of the Communities and Culture Network+. It complements work that has been previously conducted in the network in the domain of digital cultural heritage (e.g. the work of Dr David Beel and Professor Claire Wallace) by investigating a novel application of laser scanning and 3-D visualisation of community heritage resources. Further the project proposes an innovative approach to add value to these visualisations by the inclusion of user-generated content.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MIND (Mental Health Charity)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Social Media and Austerity</gtr:description><gtr:id>23D365E7-8AD4-4DD7-AA60-699E3CAFF43C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop at MindTech, Nottingham University. MindTech are a NIHR Healthcare Technology Co-operative focused on digital mental health initiatives, and includes staff from NHS and academic sectors. MindTech invited us to run a workshop in November 2013, with members of Mind, MindTech and patients. This was part of their public patient involvement activity (PPI). We used the workshop to present the findings, and to
discuss the outcomes in terms of methodological contributions to the field.The patients responded positively to the findings, and MindTech staff are interested in using the findings to inform their work on other major digital mental health tools (e.g. BigWhiteWall). 

We have been invited to a MindTech shared learning workshop in London in January 2015 to advise on a funded evaluation they are conducting on seven Innovation Labs funded digital tools for young people.

We are aware that Mind have a new major peer-support programme in planning
(supported by 3.2 million Big Lottery Funding). The project findings will be presented to
Mind so that they can inform thinking regarding the potential use of online peer support
through Elefriends in the Big Lottery programme.

The project has facilitated a strong and productive working relationship with Mind,
particularly through the 'subcontracting' of Seaneen Molloy-Vaughan, an Elefriends
moderator, who was able to very successfully connect us to the Elefriends community
through recruitment and user engagement activities, and with Youmee (Mind tech
developers) in relation to embedding the informed consent process into the Elefriends site
itself.

Communication of findings to users of Elefriends. A one-page summary of the research
findings was put on Elefriends. This gave the community the opportunity to comment on
the research findings (Appendix 2). Users that responded reacted well to summary,
agreed with the research findings and were proud to have taken part in the project.

Mind are planning future user engagement activities with Elefriends users. We are in
discussion with Mind as to how best to incorporate our findings into their on going user
engagement programme. The workshops they run are generally outsourced to an external
professional workshop organiser and facilitator.

The data set: this project has collected a large body of data on Elefriends. The online data
amounts to approximately 1.1 million words and although this project was primarily
interested in austerity and peer support there is certainly scope for future projects on a
range of other topics that could be explored via this data set (e.g. treatment).

The animations produced by YooMee. These animations were used to communicate the
research to the members of Elefriends and encourage them to take part. (Appendix 1).
The animations were translated into a language that is appropriate for Elefriends.

The ethics procedure: The project has developed a model for embedding ethical and
informed consent procedures into social media sites, which can be used in future projects.

This results in less provision of ?real world? peer-support initiatives that are known to enhance a greater sense of life satisfaction, social inclusion and belonging (Hodges, 2007). Mental health communities are consequently subject to radical transformation, with social media increasingly recruited to ?fill the gaps? left by reductions in physical community spaces and the support services that can occur within them. This is deemed a more cost effective strategy than traditional face-to-face services (Mental Health Network, 2011). This participatory action research seeks to address the experiences of a vulnerable community in a culture of austerity and will explore the capacity of service users to enhance their mental health by engaging with peer-support practices through social media.

It is vital to examine the current experiences of service users as the introduction of social media inevitably changes how people interact with other community members, as well as service providers. This pilot project, in partnership with the mental health charity Mind, will investigate the impact of the charity?s recently launched social media site - Elefriends (www.elefriends.org.uk) - which is dedicated to peer-support in mental health communities. A combination of online posts and interviews with registered members of Elefriends will be analysed. The project will investigate exactly what peer-support means for service users using Elefriends, and will consequently enable a working definition of ?online peer-support? to be developed from one of the first major mental health social media initiatives in the UK.

The follow on project sought to develop an innovative approach to online user engagement. An animated storyboard of pilot project findings was produced and posted on Elefriends. Responses were collected to the storyboard from the Elefriends users. This aim was to validate the findings and give the users an opportunity to comment on the overall analysis of the data and the use of the storyboard as a way of disseminating the findings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Media and Communication</gtr:department><gtr:description>Interrogating the complexities of digital communication for young people engaged in social action</gtr:description><gtr:id>3CB4537F-8082-4635-8894-5E41002575BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- McKenna, G. &amp;amp; Edwards, L., 'Giving Social Action a Voice: Final Report.'

Aim 1: To work with food assistance recipients to better understand their experience of the process of local food aid in Sheffield and ?managing? with food insecurity and to highlight the key issues which are raised for future research and policy making.

Through the use of narrative ethnographic methods and participatory mapping techniques this part of the research will seek to meet the following objectives:

(1) Obtain narratives of a range of recipient experiences in order to understand their experience of support (including, related to and beyond food aid). (2) Map recipients? wider food insecurity coping strategies and the place of food assistance within them. (3) Explore how narrative methods may be utilised to empower the voice of food assistance recipients and enlighten future research and policy agendas. 



Aim 2: To locate food banks and other forms of charitable food assistance within their contemporary political, economic and cultural frameworks. This part of the research will seek to meet the following objectives:

(1) Inform understanding of the terminology that has developed around the UK ?food aid? landscape. (2) Explore key aspects of the policy context which surrounds the growth of food banks and other forms of assistance. (3) Explore the role of the recent economic recession and current era of austerity on household food budgets. (4) Highlight key themes which are emerging in the growing food assistance evidence base relating to cultural dimensions within the sector. (5) Map these wider frameworks and their relationship to food banks and food aid.

We aim to use food banks as a focal point and case study for a range of connected issues that vary in scope from the very local to the global. Communities and Culture Network+ is interested in the relationship between food banks and the wider political, economic and social landscape.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Strategic Advisory Group Member for the AHRC Connected Communities Theme</gtr:description><gtr:id>95C97E00-F2EA-43DD-8C03-F34740CB6B31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>?</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>- Strategic Advisory Group Member for the AHRC Connected Communities Theme (2013-16)</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>- Strategic Advisory Group Member for the AHRC Connected Communities Theme (2013-16)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Brighton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Trajectories to Community Engagement</gtr:description><gtr:id>E4B83DD5-860C-4E80-84B5-BE22B9690FD6</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>This project will investigate what motivations exist at a local community level for older people to engage with online communities and consider the on-going effect on local community involvement.

Both PI and CI are founding members and sit on the CASIC steering committee.
b) In support of participant's aspiration to make food a community asset rather than individual privilege, funding was obtained to host a food festival in the local community. Part of the AHRC Connected Communities festival, the food festival was part of a two day event linking health and food. The event entitled 'Local, local plates, local people', drew on the pot making traditions of the area to make connections between local people and their food. http://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/connectedcommunitiesfestival/foodfestival/ Prior to the festival, workshops were held in various locations and with local community groups, encouraging people to share their experiences of food and using this as inspiration to decorate their own plates. The technical team behind the Keele Active Virtual Environment (KAVE) created a 3D installation of the plates, combining images with songs, voices and discussion from the workshops. A version of this is now available on line as an interactive game see: http://www.keele.ac.uk/pharm-docs/platesWebBuild.html The food festival attracted 600 guests and activities included: ? Community chef providing cooking demonstrations on the theme of cooking on a budget ? Stand and information from the local food bank ? Vegetable puppet making ? Demonstrations from a community bread making project, fruit pressing, smoothie making, porridge project, allotment society etc. For a press release about the event please see: http://www.keele.ac.uk/pressreleases/2015/localfoodlocalplateslocalpeople.html The event was also recorded on Storify, see: https://storify.com/KeeleMngtSchool/local-food-local-plates-local-people 
c) A grant application has been submitted in conjunction with Stoke-on-Trent foodbank and local community gardeners to Big Local in support of a community service to collect and redistribute surplus fresh produce. 
d) The PI is a founding member of North Staffs Community Food Network. This is a group formed to take forward many of the food aspirations identified in this project. 
e) Application to be made as part of North Staffordshire's bid to Building Better Opportunities Fund, bringing together a wide range of local groups to secure funding and develop projects to enhance skills and employment opportunities and grow food related activity in the local area. 
f) The New Vic Theatre has been commissioned to devise and deliver a training course for food bank volunteers. The focus of the training is to enable volunteers to capture guests' stories with the aim of changing the perception of food banks and people who use them in the wider population. Digital technologies are a key part of the capturing and broadcasting of these stories.

Development of text mining method to produce datasets: The impact of this seed project will be largely felt by RCAHMS itself and by the users of its data - a community that includes professional archaeologists and architects, planners, and of course the ever growing band of those interested in their local culture and heritage. If the methods proposed are successful and adopted by the wider archive community, the ultimate
impact of projects like this one will be a complete change in the way we view the archive curation task. There is good evidence from scientific and medical fields that assisted curation is a promising way forward.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This seed project, Event Mining in our Rural Past aimed to make the FESP data more accessible and useful to users such as the local history enthusiasts of SRP, by using text mining to extract structured data from the free text documents associated with the 'First Edition Survey Project', FESP.

Recent work had shown that CCs generally do not use the internet well to engage with their citizens, despite being required to find and deliver citizens' views to Local Authorities. In fact, over half had no observable internet presence, while a large proportion of CCs that earlier had informative internet presences no longer do so. Therefore there is a pressing need to learn how CCs' internet use can be strengthened so that CCs can live up to their requirements.

This project researched whether the Community of Practice model could be used to understand relationships between CC members involved in digital engagement work, and to find techniques to improve practices. Interviews with CC members investigated how knowledge was and could be managed and the digital tools desired for digital engagement work. Action research was used to follow and support a CC beginning to use Twitter as a dissemination and engagement channel, to understand whether it could sustainably generate social capital despite CCs' low budgets and voluntary nature.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Digital Media Exchange</gtr:description><gtr:id>D05B9596-BC8E-45CA-9D29-5D6BF8D2F583</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A workshop on 'Liveness' (co-sponsored by the CHASE consortium and organized by Professor Sally Jane Norman and Dr Emile Devereaux) provided a focal hands-on event offering opportunities for PhD training and exchange and sharing of approaches and expertise.

As a pilot, investigatory study it is difficult to quantify impact beyond our immediate professional learning networks at the moment. We continue to analyse findings and will disseminate them as suggested below. However, it is already clear that there is a need for teacher education to address more explicitly how to develop positive online media profiles and PLNs rather than (as now) emphasizing the dangers of social media and individual responsibility for privacy. We will therefore engage with our colleagues in the SoE to build this element into our programme provision, and subsequently with other schools of education / teacher education providers and training professionals in youth and social work.

Dissemination:
Our findings will be useful to a range of groups and individuals. In the first instance we will address our immediate, local networks and consider strategies for our own work in the UoB and making better use of social media networks. Our findings will be written up as a blog entry for the Education Research Centre blog edres.info. We also intend to disseminate our findings at conferences: we will submit an abstract for the 7th Critical perspectives on professional learning conference to be held in Leeds in June 2015, as well as to the BERA and UCET 2015 conferences, as well as via articles for academic journals.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Brighton contributed funding at 20%.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This pilot project will develop an interdisciplinary, critical investigation of one facet of the digital transformation of communities and cultures: the growth of social-media-based Professional Learning Networks (PLNs).

In other words, to what degree is the information provided by civil society organizations in online debt forums; and, is information shared by the indebted addressed in civil society public information campaigns. Our partner Centre for Economic and Social Inclusion is an umbrella organisation that co-ordinates and builds capacity between the public, private and third-sector organisations working within the area of financial inclusion and welfare. Here we will focus on two particular civil society groups: those that engage in advocacy for (Trade Unions, The Money Charity/Credit, Credit Union Trade Associations), and those providing services to the indebted (Citizens Advice Bureau, Money Advice Trust, Turn2U, StepChange). The first part of this project preliminarily maps these two groups and the content of their digital information. Specifically, how key civil society groups use digital platforms to highlight, educate, inform, and coordinate action related to politics of indebtedness? What are the perceived strengths and weaknesses of digital platforms in enabling a culture of resilience? Next, we analyse peer-to-peer information sharing of the indebted on two key digital forums (consumeractiongroup.co.uk, debtforum.org) specifically: How do peer-to-peer forums on indebtedness identify, inform, or enact resilience to get ?out of debt?? To what degree to they identify digital and/or real world actions by civil society organizations as source of information, advice, advocacy? These four research questions seek to enhance our understanding of the transformative impact of digital technologies on the culture of indebtedness and its impact on wider communities.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Heat or Eat: Food and Austerity in Rural England</gtr:description><gtr:id>38C69BFA-2932-4C33-AE47-439EFC3041D5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Interim report and Final Report published at http://www.communitiesandculture.org/projects/outputs/

It is concerned to establish whether the growing reliance on mobile technology and social networking sites as platforms for news content, results in a significant tendency for users to narrow engagement to events recommended to them by peer networks, or whether mobile access leads to broader engagement. Recent studies have shown a bias towards entertainment-related information, rather than social or political content, circulated via Facebook. More fine-grained research is needed to find out not only how young people access news, but also what information they consider to be ?news? and the extent to which broader socio-political circumstances influence news consumption habits. 

This bid for seed funding is for the quantitative aspect of the research only and will allow survey work to be carried out in parallel with researchers in Norway and Israel who already have funding and are due to start gathering data in January. The surveys will be followed up by in-depth interviews, which aim to provide a nuanced picture of media usage and news consumption among contrasting cohorts of students in three countries at a point of rapid technological change.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>CCN+ funded.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Plugin Narratives</gtr:description><gtr:id>DF782BBB-AB30-45D9-A80F-E76D03B99928</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Plugin Narratives seed project has developed the premise of a cocreated fictional narrative experience based around a specific local community issue, aiming to encourage reflection and community discussion of values.

collaborative and multimodal digital storytelling.
The ultimate goal of Plugin Narratives as a research project is to foster reflection and action towards a socially meaningful subject through cocreated storytelling and worldbuilding, with particular attention paid to strategies of engagement around a participatory social experience. At the seed project stage, reported here, Plugin Narratives focussed on developing the design for such an experience, by seeking input
from a range of different researchers and practitioners with expertise in the area. Through two expert workshops, a literature review, and examination of existing project work, initial ideas were developed, and challenges and opportunities identified.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>School of Media and Communication</gtr:department><gtr:description>Showcasing global expertise in digital methods for sociocultural research</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDC2A30B-3C0B-4920-A9DE-A04B839855AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Ford, H., 'The Person in the (Big) Data: A Selection of Innovative Methods, Strategies and Perspectives for Social Research in the Age of (Big) Data.'

Big Data - a term to describe the extremely large datasets that are being computationally analysed to reveal patterns, trends and associations relating to human behavior - has become pervasive in the study of society these days. In response, some researchers have pushed back on the assumptions and logics underlying Big Data methods for social science research, arguing that such methods do not presuppose the need for smaller, more local analyses, and, in fact, such analyses may even be essential to gaining valuable insights into social behavior and the human experience. The goal of this project was to document the methods of this growing group of researchers who are experimenting with a research practice that makes the most of digital data while retaining the connection to the humans who produce that data.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Aberdeen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rural Crafting Communities in the Digital Age</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8E053C8-26E6-4B68-8E9F-CAD9586E3CE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Academic impact:
For the academic researchers on the project, the research brought new insights into the peculiarities of digital engagement for rural craftspeople and makers. We have developed new methodologies for digital engagement, which although developed with and for creative practitioners, might be applicable in other contexts. A storytelling approach can be engaging for people from all walks of life - for example some of the project partners are currently working on a project using storytelling as a route to compiling a community website in a rural village (Storytelling Lumsden).
Non-academic impact:
Many project participants have now developed websites which they are happy with, and are engaging with broader networks through social media channels such as Twitter and Wordpress: &amp;quot;The Wordpress workshop provided me with new information, courage and confidence to create my own website and realise I can do it on my own&amp;quot;.
The project brought together members of different practice-based communities into one group: &amp;quot;it's a varied group of different people it's quite interesting to hear from different sides how they would go about doing it, and then put that into practice in your own work.&amp;quot; Strong ties have been formed within the group which have led to mutual benefit between members, for example in collaborating in the recent North East Open Studios (NEOS) - for example by sharing venues and exhibiting spaces. These ties are maintained and developed through a Facebook group for participants, which was created by participants after they had the idea at one of the workshops.
Our non-academic partners (SSW, Talk About Local and Make Aberdeen) gained a deeper understanding of the ways that social media and digital technologies can support the practices of craftspeople and makers - something that they will use to inform their work with practitioners in the future: &amp;quot;people at the end of [the workshops] were very, very interested. It obviously struck a chord, it's something that's needed in these rural environments, and people are super up for it because they see there is an impact for their work - be it through the selling of jewellery production, or through the engagement with communities further afield.&amp;quot; (Nuno Sacramento, SSW).
There are other potential stakeholders that would find the process and findings of our work of value, particularly other organisations that seek to support creative industries on a larger scale, such as Creative Scotland and local authority departments supporting the creative sector. We have a number of engagement activities planned with relevant stakeholders from some of these organisations (see Dissemination section). We hope to find routes to impacting policy which at the moment does not adequately emphasise support and training for rural creative industries.

It supported a group of rurally-based craftspeople and makers in Aberdeenshire to engage with digital technologies in new ways. The following research question was addressed: How can we co-produce digital practices which empower rural craftspeople and promote their professional and creative practices? We engaged with a total of 12 craftspeople over the course of three participatory workshops, using storytelling methods to encourage practitioners to co-produce practice-based narratives and share these with wider audiences online. By the end of the project, our participants had developed the skills to engage with wider networks through Twitter and through creating effective blogs/websites. They had also taken part in a workshop introducing them to digital making tools, during which they produced artefacts relevant to their ongoing practices.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Connected Communities</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange Programme with AHRC Connected Communities</gtr:description><gtr:id>8812D52A-B392-4CE2-8AAF-CEEE0D046A54</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>CCN+ PI, Helen Thornham, has joined the advisory board for the AHRC Connected Communities theme.

As earlier CCN+ Scoping studies have shown computational expertise is not the property of generationally defined digital natives, nor a fixed property - but is a mutual techno-social co-construction.

b) In support of participant's aspiration to make food a community asset rather than individual privilege, funding was obtained to host a food festival in the local community. Part of the AHRC Connected Communities festival, the food festival was part of a two day event linking health and food. The event entitled 'Local, local plates, local people', drew on the pot making traditions of the area to make connections between local people and their food. http://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/connectedcommunitiesfestival/foodfestival/ Prior to the festival, workshops were held in various locations and with local community groups, encouraging people to share their experiences of food and using this as inspiration to decorate their own plates. The technical team behind the Keele Active Virtual Environment (KAVE) created a 3D installation of the plates, combining images with songs, voices and discussion from the workshops. A version of this is now available on line as an interactive game see: http://www.keele.ac.uk/pharm-docs/platesWebBuild.html The food festival attracted 600 guests and activities included: ? Community chef providing cooking demonstrations on the theme of cooking on a budget ? Stand and information from the local food bank ? Vegetable puppet making ? Demonstrations from a community bread making project, fruit pressing, smoothie making, porridge project, allotment society etc. For a press release about the event please see: http://www.keele.ac.uk/pressreleases/2015/localfoodlocalplateslocalpeople.html The event was also recorded on Storify, see: https://storify.com/KeeleMngtSchool/local-food-local-plates-local-people 
c) A grant application has been submitted in conjunction with Stoke-on-Trent foodbank and local community gardeners to Big Local in support of a community service to collect and redistribute surplus fresh produce.

e) Application to be made as part of North Staffordshire's bid to Building Better Opportunities Fund, bringing together a wide range of local groups to secure funding and develop projects to enhance skills and employment opportunities and grow food related activity in the local area. 
f) The New Vic Theatre has been commissioned to devise and deliver a training course for food bank volunteers. The focus of the training is to enable volunteers to capture guests' stories with the aim of changing the perception of food banks and people who use them in the wider population. Digital technologies are a key part of the capturing and broadcasting of these stories.

The production of the infographic was intended to be central in producing impact of the project. Upon its publication it produced 8,672 impressions on twitter (from four tweets). Amongst those retweeting the infographic were the Head of News of Twitter. During a journalism industry conference at the BBC (Revival of Local Journalism - 25 June 2014) the PI made reference to the research in a question at a panel discussion. Both Nesta and Ofcom representatives were at this event and showed interest in the research. Given the debate about the decline of mainstream journalism there is potential for the project to produce a modest impact at a policy level. B31 Voices themselves have made many references to the research on social media and two hyperlocal publishers in Birmingham attended the research seminar (mentioned below) at Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural Research. The BBC have taken an interest in the work and have asked the PI to partner on a new project looking at community news in the West Midlands.

The CCN+ has hitherto been focused upon national participation in digital cultures with some international comparative dimensions (Finland, USA, China, New Zealand). The Oxford Internet Institute report for 2013 (to which we contributed: Dutton, W. and Blank, G. (2013) Oxford Internet Institute Report, Oxford) has identified at least five ?cultures of the internet? in the UK based upon ways in which people use digital media and attitudes towards it . But would we find the same elsewhere? 



The aim of this scoping project is to develop a set of hypotheses and research questions that could help to us to understand cultures of the internet globally. We assume that in developing countries, for example, the use of mobile phones is more important than computers or mobile devices, whilst in China and Russia, people will use national equivalents of face book and twitter or other national social media sites.



The outcome of the project will be to design a set of questions which can be applied worldwide on the World Values Survey next wave (2015-2017). The questions should enable us to be able understand cultures of the internet in different global locations by analysing these questions alongside questions about politics, civil society, religion, work and family in Europe and the North America etc. However, they should also be culturally sensitive enough to encompass developments in sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia, Arab countries and Latin America. The scope of this project is potentially very large and will help to update and improve the existing technology questions used on the WVS, which were invented 20 years ago and tend to reflect the technology at the time.

This project will also involve overseas students at the University of Aberdeen to develop and test ideas.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Reading</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Creating a Virtual Museum</gtr:description><gtr:id>70BD63F3-0B0A-48F0-8420-B2942A0E7103</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The majority of the MERL buildings were modelled along with nine objects. These ranged in size, shape and materials to test the digital scanning technologies, and were chosen for their appeal to school age children. 

The finished model was demonstrated at two events, one for museum staff and volunteers, and another to groups of children at a local school. At each of these events, three formats of the model were available to experience: iPad, PC monitor, and Oculus Rift headset, alongside four of the objects scanned into the model and brought from MERL. Around 80 people attended the two events and were able to experience the VR models, and provide feedback, thoughts and comments on their experience. 

Teaching: The MERL model and the techniques used to create it were used as the main teaching example in a one week module for MSc students from the School of the Built Environment at the University of Reading - 'Advanced visualization and interactive technologies'. Twelve students produced their own 3D models using photogrammetry, and four students have taken this research as the starting point for their individual projects. The feedback was universally positive, especially the new 'hands-on' approach this project allowed.

Software Development: Revizto, the software used to bring together the various parts of the model (architecture, objects and additional information) and make it navigable, heard of the project through Twitter and contacted IE to write a case study and suggest ways the software could be developed to suit this type of application. The context for the case study was the re-purposing of the software from a building information management tool, to a visitor experience. This went live on their website (https://revizto.com/en/blog/entry/university-of-reading-merl) in October 2015.

Further Funding:
An AHRC grant was awarded to IE for a new 12 month project: 'Sensations of Roman Life' beginning March 2016. This will build on this project to create a VR Roman house, but including sounds and smells, to be displayed at Chedworth House - a National Trust managed Roman villa complex.

- The project developed a novel methodology: We aimed to produce a 'design fiction documentary', an as-yet unseen format for design fictions. Similarly design fiction has so far not been used as a tool for interrogating and developing insights pertaining to policy. Co-production of design fiction is also a new area.

As the research progressed the focus on developing community-based, practicable components of the tax system was replaced with exploring the potential of design fiction methods for enabling everyday utopian communities, the Brixton Pound local currency community, to enhance and maintain the attempts to organise society otherwise.
The research involved hosting an ideation workshop with community members to develop microfictions, the development of a narrative and artefacts, the filming of a speculative documentary, and a final discussion session to explore how these scenarios enabled the community members to think differently about tax.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Storytelling for Development</gtr:description><gtr:id>56BC89B3-7CD5-4849-A215-D962051AEE3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidiciplinary: Digital technology, Architecture, Planning, Social Science.
The Storytelling for Development project has concluded with the generation of all five of the originally planned outputs and significant insight into the two research questions. Project partners have worked closely together to meet the project aims and objectives, although discrepancies between the priorities of each partner organisation have led to some unexpected shifts in procedures and methods. The project generated a corpus of digital stories that slightly exceeded our target and provided substance for a thorough analysis of demographics and content. This rich set of findings can steer future projects seeking to use digital storytelling in the context of urban redevelopment.

In a recent report on architecture and planning in the UK created by project partners Farrells architect planners, current design processes were criticised for not being participatory enough in representing the needs and aspirations of local residents, or respecting the history and cultural heritage of areas subject to re--development. The research team aimed to take a more holistic view of places and their identities and to draw on knowledge of the past in planning for the future, using digital storytelling as an empowering and pro--active method of community engagement in the planning process for urban redesign. Within the above context, we aimed to help communities and architects to tell and exchange stories about the past, present and future of an urban neighbourhood. We address two research questions: 1. What is the role of digital storytelling in community engagement for urban development? 2. What is the value of past, present and future stories in urban design?</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of East London</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Social Media and Austerity</gtr:description><gtr:id>6991DFB5-36BB-4822-8BA4-A1E1B5261B09</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop at MindTech, Nottingham University. MindTech are a NIHR Healthcare Technology Co-operative focused on digital mental health initiatives, and includes staff from NHS and academic sectors. MindTech invited us to run a workshop in November 2013, with members of Mind, MindTech and patients. This was part of their public patient involvement activity (PPI). We used the workshop to present the findings, and to
discuss the outcomes in terms of methodological contributions to the field.The patients responded positively to the findings, and MindTech staff are interested in using the findings to inform their work on other major digital mental health tools (e.g. BigWhiteWall). 

We have been invited to a MindTech shared learning workshop in London in January 2015 to advise on a funded evaluation they are conducting on seven Innovation Labs funded digital tools for young people.

We are aware that Mind have a new major peer-support programme in planning
(supported by 3.2 million Big Lottery Funding). The project findings will be presented to
Mind so that they can inform thinking regarding the potential use of online peer support
through Elefriends in the Big Lottery programme.

The project has facilitated a strong and productive working relationship with Mind,
particularly through the 'subcontracting' of Seaneen Molloy-Vaughan, an Elefriends
moderator, who was able to very successfully connect us to the Elefriends community
through recruitment and user engagement activities, and with Youmee (Mind tech
developers) in relation to embedding the informed consent process into the Elefriends site
itself.

Communication of findings to users of Elefriends. A one-page summary of the research
findings was put on Elefriends. This gave the community the opportunity to comment on
the research findings (Appendix 2). Users that responded reacted well to summary,
agreed with the research findings and were proud to have taken part in the project.

Mind are planning future user engagement activities with Elefriends users. We are in
discussion with Mind as to how best to incorporate our findings into their on going user
engagement programme. The workshops they run are generally outsourced to an external
professional workshop organiser and facilitator.

The data set: this project has collected a large body of data on Elefriends. The online data
amounts to approximately 1.1 million words and although this project was primarily
interested in austerity and peer support there is certainly scope for future projects on a
range of other topics that could be explored via this data set (e.g. treatment).

The animations produced by YooMee. These animations were used to communicate the
research to the members of Elefriends and encourage them to take part. (Appendix 1).
The animations were translated into a language that is appropriate for Elefriends.

The ethics procedure: The project has developed a model for embedding ethical and
informed consent procedures into social media sites, which can be used in future projects.

Mind subcontracted a member of staff (Seaneen Molloy-Vaughan) and also provided access to their web platform 'Elefriends' for the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Mental health communities are feeling the full extent of current austerity measures due to the redistribution of social care services and significant closure of physical community spaces. This results in less provision of ?real world? peer-support initiatives that are known to enhance a greater sense of life satisfaction, social inclusion and belonging (Hodges, 2007). Mental health communities are consequently subject to radical transformation, with social media increasingly recruited to ?fill the gaps? left by reductions in physical community spaces and the support services that can occur within them. This is deemed a more cost effective strategy than traditional face-to-face services (Mental Health Network, 2011). This participatory action research seeks to address the experiences of a vulnerable community in a culture of austerity and will explore the capacity of service users to enhance their mental health by engaging with peer-support practices through social media.

It is vital to examine the current experiences of service users as the introduction of social media inevitably changes how people interact with other community members, as well as service providers. This pilot project, in partnership with the mental health charity Mind, will investigate the impact of the charity?s recently launched social media site - Elefriends (www.elefriends.org.uk) - which is dedicated to peer-support in mental health communities. A combination of online posts and interviews with registered members of Elefriends will be analysed. The project will investigate exactly what peer-support means for service users using Elefriends, and will consequently enable a working definition of ?online peer-support? to be developed from one of the first major mental health social media initiatives in the UK.

The follow on project sought to develop an innovative approach to online user engagement. An animated storyboard of pilot project findings was produced and posted on Elefriends. Responses were collected to the storyboard from the Elefriends users. This aim was to validate the findings and give the users an opportunity to comment on the overall analysis of the data and the use of the storyboard as a way of disseminating the findings.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sussex</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Sussex Centre for Cultural Studies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Queer, Feminist and Social Media Praxis Event</gtr:description><gtr:id>C4C77549-4B13-4767-ACD2-BB2CE164B61D</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>Members of the CCN+ funded SusNet network will be contributing to this event in May 2013.

- EVENT: In June 2016, Yoko Akama (Associate Professor, RMIT University, Melbourne) visited Temple Works to host a workshop on the theme of 'uncertainty'. Dr. Helen Thornham (Principal Investigator of the CCN+), Dr. Edgar G&amp;oacute;mez Cruz (Research Fellow of the CCN+) and I co-hosted the event, demonstrating a shared interest in Temple Works as a locus of academic research.
- ARTIST RESIDENCY: The virtual archive project not only contributed to academic research but also served as an invaluable tool in promoting the use of Temple Works (helping to generate revenue important to the survival of the cultural project). Having made such a strong contribution to Temple Works, the PI of this project was offered the position of 'artist in residence'. This priviliged position not only made it possible to offer further contributions to the cultural project but also granted ongoing access to the site, essential to the success of the ethnographic research project.
- POLICY INFLUENCE: The virtual archive created during this pilot study has been invaluable in informing decisions related to the proposed sale and regeneration of the Temple Works site. Leeds City Council, the Temple Works cultural project and commercial investors have used the project in developing a strategy for the future of the site. As the changes in ownership and plans for the future are negotiated, the project has offered a critical perspective on the cultural value of spaces like Temple Works (and the impact any redevelopment might have on it). Significant weight has been added to the argument that the regeneration should be sympathetic to the current sensory experience of the site.
- ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES: In September 2015, the virtual archive project was selected for exhibition at the Digital Design Weekend at the V&amp;amp;A. This high profile event allowed the project to be demonstrated to academic colleagues, industry practitioners and the general public. Over 9,000 visitors attended over two days. Not only did this event generate increased academic interest in the project, raise the profile of the CCN+ and result in the submission of a large cross-university research funding application, it also illustrated that the project is relatable for a broad audience.
The project was regularly shown at 'heritage open days' at Temple Works. These events primarily attracted historians, local artists and people who used to be employed at Temple Works (typically when it was a distribution centre for Kays Catalogue). Interestingly, the historians tended to view the project as an archive, the artists tended to focus on its aesthetic qualities and materiality and the employees were interested in using the project as a method for accessing the past. 
In June 2016, an exhibition of projects created at Temple Works is being held at Leeds Central Library as a legacy of the cultural project. With funding from Leeds City Council and the support of many previous 'artists in residence', the exhibition hopes to celebrate the contribution that the project made to the creative and cultural community of South Leeds.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>20 percent of fEC.

Alongside these activities Edgar will be developing his own ethnographic study into how young people learn, engage, develop, use and integrate digital technologies into their everyday practices, especially those related to creativity and audio-visual production.

The collaboration will facilitate a study into how young people learn, engage, develop, use and integrate digital technologies in everyday practices.

This presentation, at THT's main offices, was attended by over 25 regional and head office stakeholders, included a guided conversation through the key research findings and a tour of the new website. Following on from this information dissemination, health professionals were invited to undertake a training event that helped them to put some of the key findings into practice. It is envisaged that further training events at regional offices will be held in the next 12 months. THT were extremely enthusiastic about the findings and will use the research in their negotiations with clinical commissioning groups and the NHS. The project partner, Terrence Higgins Trust, will benefit from the findings of the Reaching out Online project by being able to use this data in their negotiations with clinical commision bodies and the NHS.
- The research findings of the CCN 'Reaching Out Online' pilot study are being used to help Terrence Higgins Trust shape their national policy on developing and maintaining online intervention work. The 'Reaching Out Online' research findings are being used to help Terrence Higgins Trust shape their national policy on developing and maintaining online intervention work.
- In total, 12 organisations were invited to engage with the project findings of Reaching out online. These engagements included a series of workshops and discussion forums as well as more formal presentations. The organisations invited to participate were: Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Council; AllSorts (LGBT youth); MindOut LGBT mental health); Broken Rainbow (Domestic Violence &amp;amp; Abuse); Terrence Higgins Trust (Black &amp;amp; Minority Ethnic service users); GiFi - Commercial software development; Projekt - Swedish HIV/AIDS prevention; Albert Kennedy Trust (vulnerable LGBT Youth); Health &amp;amp; Inclusion Project (community research organisation); Birmingham CCG (primary care); Positive East (BME Community); MHealth Habitat.
In October 2014, Dr Mowlabocus was presented the project's findings to the staff of GeoSpock in Cambridge, UK. GeoSpock is a technology start-up that has developed a more secure method of using GPS software than that currently used by app developers. Dr Mowlabocus was able to provide GeoSpok with a presentation that matched up the research findings of the original project with some of the aims and objectives of GiFi. Following the meeting, Dr Mowlabocus has acted as a liaison point between GeoSpock and Terrence Higgins Trust, both of whom are now in discussions regarding a possible future collaboration.
- Dr Mowlabocus was invited to run two events for Brighton &amp;amp; Hove LGBT Switchboard - one community forum and one service provider workshop - with the aim of disseminating findings of the research and identifying further concerns that community members had regarding these heavily used technologies.
- Mowlabocus was the keynote speaker at the annual gay men's health conference organised in Stockholm by RFSL, one of the oldest LGBT
organisations in the world.
- In January 2015, Dr Mowlabocus was the lead presenter and a co-facilitator at an MHealth Habitat workshop in Leeds.
- In October 2014, Dr Mowlabocus acted as a consultant to the Albert Kennedy Trust. Dr Mowlabocus was able to talk through some of the key principles of digital outreach work and, at the present time, the two parties are in ongoing discussions regarding a future training event for new staff.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>During the course of the research, further funding was secured (from Terrence Higgins Trust) to undertake a complimentary piece of work that focused on MSM4 users of digital media.

Terrence Higgins Trust, also secured funding from from the European Centre for Disease Control (?25,000) to undertake a pan-European scoping study that built upon the methodologies employed and findings identified in the Reaching out online.

THT's Justin Harbottle Justin acted as the non-HEI project collaborator on this research. He brought to the project a wealth of expertise in the fields of sexual health and online health promotion. He also acted as a liaison between the partner institutions and played a direct role in shaping the research methods and identifying the findings. He was also be responsible for stakeholder recruitment and services buy-in.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This pilot project builds upon the CCN+ Expertise and Knowledge scoping study, and develops an existing research relationship between the University of Sussex and the Terrence Higgins Trust (THT), the UK's oldest HIV prevention charity and a member of Health Promotion England (HPE), a newly formed consortium charged with delivering HIV prevention work to targeted 'at-risk' communities. The research speaks to some of the aims of HPE and will help to shape a key element of the intervention strategies being designed to support the health and wellbeing of gay men and men who have sex with men (MSM).

Specifically, the research examines the use of online social media tools and platforms by outreach workers during sexual health interventions targeted at gay male and MSM communities. The development of social media platforms has recently contributed to a reframing of health promotion work, particularly where at-risk communities are identified as having particular investments in online social/sexual networking practices. This project feeds into the original scoping study identified above by exploring the methods and consequences of delivering sexual health knowledge and expertise via digital platforms.

Follow-on funding was awarded to this CCN+ pilot study in 2014 to undertake targeted dissemination work in order to explore opportunities for knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leeds Citizens Advice Bureau</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Exploring Digital Transformations of Community, Culture and Welfare in Austere Times: the Case of Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:id>455F8A3D-BB5F-455F-949C-8502D92D89A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have so far communicated to our stakeholders in the following ways:

Our contemporary digital and networked communications landscape is said to raise new questions about whether our interests and well-being are being served, and about what conditions support or threaten the attainment of well-being for individuals and communities, especially in times of austerity. This panel addresses these concerns through a focus on what a 'good life' might look like in the context of big data and social media analytics. Communications scholarship about data analytics has been polarized to date: in one corner are celebrants of the possibilities that such techniques offer for 'knowing the social' and, in the other, critics, largely operating within a critical Marxist tradition, who see modern day analytics as new forms of value extraction, surveillance and control. Recognising the value of both approaches, this panel weaves together both perspectives through four papers which reflect on the ways in which big data and social media analytics and their visualizations and algorithms might serve the social or public good - what we call in the panel title 'really useful analytics', adapting cultural theorist Richard Johnson's concept 'really useful knowledge' (1979), as in self-defined and empowering knowledge, to be contrasted with 'merely useful knowledge', which serves rather to keep people in their place.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>StoryStorm Vancouver</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1520E58D-B5B0-4F0D-8DFC-102A3453F766</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Evaluation of Storystorm events and workshop activities is cumulative with the data and evaluation will be brought together at a workshop proposed and successfully accepted at DIS 2014.

The hypothesis investigated is that playful, non-obstructive interventions foster a positive social experience yet can be used to shape pedestrian movement. Shaping pedestrian movement is desirable for a range of purposes including security, commerce and entertainment.

The interventions employ a range of media from floor patterns to large digital screens in indoor and outdoor environments. They aimed to influence pedestrian movement by disrupting the routine use of space or by triggering playful behavior. Observation demonstrated that playful interventions are able to create zones of attraction and exclusion, engage people's curiosity and elicit playful actions. The influence of increased cognitive load at personal level and goal-directed behavior was also considered.

The results suggest that increased understanding between environmental and interpersonal stimuli and behavioural responses can provide guidance in using socially acceptable design interventions to influence use of space in different operational contexts.

Part of the AHRC Connected Communities festival, the food festival was part of a two day event linking health and food. The event entitled 'Local, local plates, local people', drew on the pot making traditions of the area to make connections between local people and their food. Prior to the festival, workshops were held in various locations and with local community groups, encouraging people to share their experiences of food and using this as inspiration to decorate their own plates. The technical team behind the Keele Active Virtual Environment (KAVE) created a 3D installation of the plates, combining images with songs, voices and discussion from the workshops.

Building on the desire of the young women to explore 'smart' jewellery (wearable technology) and its application with young women concerned about or experiencing intimate partner violence and control, GirlsMakingHistory worked with Viv Kuh (creative producer/tech/performative interfaces) and Heidi Hinder (artist and maker) to develop our understanding of what makes jewellery desirable.
Through reflecting on our own meaningful jewellery, exploring design features of fashion jewellery, creating individual jewellery designs and in-depth questioning of how our personas could use a piece of smart jewellery as well as the practical and safety implications of wearable technology, GirlsMakingHistory developed our understanding of how wearable technology could feature within the project. This workshop reflected heavily on the advice of the advisory group with regards to wearable tech and came to the conclusion that marketable jewellery to fund the GirlsMakingHistory digital platform was a way to move forwards with this idea.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Engagement, Expertise and the Everyday or the Problems of a Tooling-Up Approach</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E6A0E463-2118-40CF-88CB-2A024DD69EEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop with developers and academics

The event included talks by Dr Madeline Balaam (lecturer in Interaction Design in Computing Science at Newcastle University and a member of Open Lab), Helen Thornham (Associate Professor in Digital Culture at the University of Leeds) and Victoria Betton (mHabitat).

During the workshop, we discussed the ethics, challenges and disruptions around public health in relation to digital and social media. We also explored a number of cutting edge digital technologies and interactions, including technological and business advances through community initiatives like FeedFinder - an App that enables women to find, rate and share places for public breastfeeding, and AppMovement - a platform enabling communities to commission and design their own location review applications, and develop a crowd-generated evidence base through which to drive change.

Switchboard had identified an an increasing number of calls from LGBT people in which digital and social media were mentioned as sources of problems or concerns. Tasked with addressing this issue, and with better understanding how the organisation might use these same technologies for LGBT health and wellbeing initiatives, Ms Antoniou invited Dr Mowlabocus to run two events - one community forum and one service provider workshop - with the aim of disseminating findings of the research and identifying further concerns that community members had regarding these heavily used technologies. The project team recruited 15 participants to the community forum and representatives from 6 community groups to the stakeholder workshop. The latter event was attended by: 
? LGBT Switchboard 
? MindOut (mental health service provision) 
? Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Health &amp;amp; Inclusion Project (community research support) 
? Broken Rainbow (domestic violence &amp;amp; abuse) 
? Brighton &amp;amp; Hove Council (commissioner for sexual health) 
? Positive East (BME HIV service) 
? AllSorts (LGBT Youth) 


Feedback from the workshop and community forum was overwhelmingly positive and participants spoke of it being 'insightful' (Broken Rainbow) and 'useful for the sector' (MindOut). The project report is currently being used to shape policy at both Broken Rainbow and LGBT Switchboard. Following on from this event, AllSorts invited the project team to run a session with their service users in order to better understand the uses of digital and social media by young LGBT people.

Drawing in a variety of theoretical accounts, the panel's goal is to present different empirical studies that could dialogue with those accounts in order to expand the understanding and scope of photography in the digital age.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Storystorm - Building an 'Autobiography of Dundee'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B7A1AA43-2CE1-4904-9B1F-077238F64268</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop featuring experts from across the UK was held in Dundee Contemporary Arts on Thursday November 28th and is inviting contributions from everyone, from designers and architects to collectors of Dundee `stuff' and those who simply had a story to tell about the city.

GirlsMakingHistory created a portfolio of personas (for more information about personas in third sector organisations see this Innovation Lab article) identifying the life stories and circumstances of the young women we want our digital platform to reach. These were then pooled into two personas which we used going forwards.

We then used the two 'representative' personas to explore ways in which young women might come into contact with the GirlsMakingHistory project.
Working with local artist Joff Winterhart, we engaged in a beauty perception exercise with the artist and another member of the GirlsMakingHistory team highlighting the contradictions in how we see beauty in ourselves and others. We concluded with a facilitated discussion of 'beauty' and the way our appearance could often become a feature of emotional and coercive/controlling abusive relationships and friendships.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Communication of findings to users of Elefriends</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C7D8DF72-7422-4A19-A1AB-477E618D6AD4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A one-page summary of the research findings was put on Elefriends.

This panel sought to explore digital imaging methods as immediate and dialogical processes in data generation in a fieldwork context, and how digital image-making technologies impact on photographic theory in anthropology. Gomez' paper presented the concept of Trajectory looks to grasp these elements in a single theoretical standpoint. It is intended to establish a dialogue with the fl&amp;acirc;neur in De Certeau's and Benjamin's work and with some current approaches to visual/digital ethnography, especially those related to movement and senses (i.e. Sarah Pink's work). At the same time, it looks to account for the material infrastructures where many social interactions take place. The paper will present two ethnographic fieldworks as examples of the use of the concept; one about supermarket trolleys in Barcelona, and one on Urban Screen in multiple settings. Ultimately, the paper intents to be the beginning of a dialogue about the use of the concept Trajectories in ethnographic research.

Based on comparative research in Manchester and Sheffield, it explores potential effects of digital engagement and open data for allotment holders to build stronger, more active communities, benefit local economies and improve environmental sustainability and food security. The second half of the panel sought to understand the different ways in which issues around digging have reemerged in recent years, to understand these by looking at how they have been expressed and mobilized by different people and actors. This can be expressed as actual digging linked to food production, symbolic digging as performance, digging up local histories, or as new forms of gift-giving.

Her paper, 'Engagement, Expertise and the Everyday or the Problems of a Tooling-Up Approach' will present aspects of several projects which have or will be taking place within the network.

This paper will argue that that the discourses, practices and policies around seemingly discrete and separate issues such as the digital; communities and publics; the user of technology; young people; old people; neoliberalism; austerity measures and the wider economy, are spiralling closer and closer together. Furthermore, unless we work to connect these issues, we will continue to frame both 'community' and 'digital' in seriously problematic ways.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Self-representation, challenging representation: MeCCSA 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD817521-844A-48BD-AA24-1A2D44D01BC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The idea of self-representation contains a claim that the self is speaking back to representations made of her, by others. This raises the question of whether and how people at the margins might use self-representation to address dominant media representations of people 'like them'. Through analysing the documentary-making process and outputs via which a group of young people represent themselves, this paper explores this relationship between self-representation and dominant media representations. We present early findings from a project between the University of Leeds and Space2, a Leeds-based third sector organisation that works with young people and other community groups in the city. Our project explores the impact of the coalition's welfare reforms through a lens that takes in identity, everyday life and dominant media representations of young people living in social housing. Working with Space2, 8 young people between the ages of 14-20 make their own representations addressing issues that concern them. We are interested in how these self-representations might contest, repeat, dispute, mimic, parody and otherwise speak to mainstream representation of welfare reform and its recipients. Our investigation seeks to unpack claims both about young people's digital literacy, and about the affordances of the genre of self-representation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Embedded Expertise and the Everyday</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEB29D03-0BF9-42CA-AF8A-B38A225B7C17</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Presentation of key aspects of the CCN+ 'Public Engagement and Cultures of Expertise' scoping study at a workshop on 'Expertise' at the university of Sussex.

This half-day symposium addressed the practical, theoretical and conceptual issues and challenges arising from researching public engagement. The aim of the workshop was twofold. Firstly to bring together a number of projects actively investigating forms of public engagement in order to identify common themes and issues. Our second aim was to ask what engagement could, should and does look like particularly within the framework of communities and culture.

The workshop brought together PIs of the Connected Communities theme, policy makers and other academics to discuss convergent issues. It resulted in closer collaborations across the funding councils.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.communitiesandculture.org/projects/example-project-1/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scoping Study Presentations to Leeds City Council</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D191B78B-CABA-487F-A626-2FB7D7585BBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Members of the CCN+, based at the University of Leeds, presented the results of the 'Public Engagment and Cultures of Expertise' scoping studies to a panel from Leeds City Council.

Using the personas developed in the previous workshop we 'walked through' the relationship each of these personas might have with their boyfriend identifying key moments where abusive and controlling behaviours might take hold and the points at which the persona might begin to think of her relationship in abusive terms.
In a skills and technological awareness exercise we experimented with new technologies through digital printing, using 3D modelling software to print our own 'worry beads'. This was followed by a facilitated discussion of how tactile objects might aid or hinder our persona, time was spent identifying and problematizing some of the safety issues around smart jewellery using the 'find my iPhone' app as a specific example.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Photography in Everyday Lives: Emergent Approaches</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1B34FA5-43C0-4828-A4E8-DD2C23889339</gtr:id><gtr:impact>G&amp;oacute;mez Cruz, E.

Personalised Health and Care 2020 (November 2015) sets out a framework for digital technologies with a bold ambition:
One of the greatest opportunities of the 21st century is the potential to safely harness the power of the technology revolution, which has transformed our society, to meet the challenges of improving health and providing better, safer, sustainable care for all. To date the health and care system has only begun to exploit the potential of using data and technology at a national or local level. Our ambition is for a health and care system that enables people to make healthier choices, to be more resilient, to deal more effectively with illness and disability when it arises, and to have happier, longer lives in old age; a health and care system where technology can help tackle inequalities and improve access to services for the vulnerable.
But in our rush to embrace digital technologies, are we paying proper attention to the implications for all of us as patients and citizens? What does digitally transformed health and care mean for privacy and surveillance? Who benefits and who might get left behind from the so called 'digital revolution' in health and care? How do we elide patient/citizen choice with professional expertise?
This session aims to bring people with an interest in the topic to start a conversation. We hope that it will result a regular meet up of interested people and bridge a dialogue across disciplines and sectors. is aimed at academics, people accessing health and care services, practitioners, digital innovators and anyone else with an interest in this topic.
The session is hosted by Victoria Betton, director of digital health programme mHabitat and PhD student at the School of Media and Communications; Dr Helen Thornham, Associate Professor Digital Cultures at the School of Media and Communications; Dr Ian Kellar, Associate Professor and lead for behaviour change at the School of Psychology; Imran Ali, Founder of Carbon Engineering and Living Lab, with an interest in emerging technologies.

The debate encouraged discussion about how to facilitate productive collaboration between citizen-led community groups and open data communities.

As a starting point, the debate focused on open data work that is linked to the increased interest in urban agriculture, such as the CCN+ Everyday Growing Cultures project. The debate drew on UK and US examples, particularly on the work of 596Acres, an organisation that has used US Land registry data to identify land for growing crops and actively engaging citizens in making the land available for agricultural use. The Everyday Growing Cultures project, which sought to do the same in Manchester and Sheffield, established links with 596Acres as part of the CCN+ pilot study.

Better understanding the potential of citizen-engaged open data plays a crucial role in future developments in this area.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Mediating Heritage Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C8A57BC9-061D-418C-97B6-ECCA65BFAE97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This full day workshop investigated the intersection between cultural heritage, digital technologies and the built environment emphasizing the effect of this convergence on people's experiences of heritage.

The event included presentations of research work from academia and industry.

Some of the ideas created during the workshops were used in applications responding to a subsequent CCN+ call for pilot studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>workshop facilitator</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.communitiesandculture.org/news/mediating-heritage-workshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Poster presentation at BASHH / BHIVA 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E3BDFD7F-2BAE-4E2E-A548-9E2A98CBAF2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation of findings from the 'Reaching Out Online' scoping study at BASHH / BHIVA annual conference (Liverpool).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Communities on the Margins (MeCCSA 2016) on YouTube</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EE705EB-A205-4C5F-A219-923EDE872B47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Video of Helen Thornham's plenary talk at MeCCSA 2016, presenting CCN+ findings, published on YouTube.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Clv05RVJtEk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Payday lenders let off the hook as regulators miss the point</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D32AE23F-9E99-48E3-9A19-07738705C48B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article sparked discussion in 'Comments' section.

GirlsMakingHistory is using a mixed-methods design including workshops, narrative interviewing and a collaborative ethnography of the projects publicly accessible data. This research is founded on co-productive principles, namely that all elements of the project and its research should be collaboratively developed. This commitment has underpinned the projects format and required that we approach our design with a reflexive outlook and a willingness to adapt and change our ideas in response to the cross-pollination of learning and expertise that is enabled through this co-productive team.

Two digital prototypes were collaboratively devised: the 'Emoti-meter' and the 'Knowing the Signs' game.

A social media surgery is an informal gathering of people who want to learn how to use the web to communicate, campaign or collaborate. Surgeries are deliberately relaxed. No presentations, no jargon, noone telling people what they think they should know. Instead you will sit next to someone who understands good ways to use the internet, someone who will listen to what you do, and then show you free, useful tools. If you like what you see they can also help you set up your blog, Facebook page or Twitter account.

At each of these events, three formats of the model were available to experience: iPad, PC monitor, and Oculus Rift headset, alongside four of the objects scanned into the model and brought from MERL. Around 80 people attended the two events and were able to experience the VR models, and provide feedback, thoughts and comments on their experience.

Around 80 people attended the two events, and 56 questionnaires were collected. Preliminary findings from an analysis of the questionnaires and initial thoughts from the qualitative information collected offer four main insights. First, the two main groups (museum workers and school pupils) despite their differences in age, familiarity with the technology and familiarity with the real space, did not produce significantly different responses to the experience. Second, the sensation of being in a different place is ambiguous, with some responses suggesting a separation from reality and others an anchor to it. Third, the experience was compromised by the quality of the model and the demonstration format. The level of realism was good, but not quite good enough to be entirely convincing, and the performance of the hardware was also at its limits, with sometimes distractingly poor responsiveness (iPad) and among the adults a common feeling of motion sickness in the Oculus Rift. Fourth, the idea of aiming to accurately recreate a real place and real objects within it as a proxy for visiting the actual place and objects is flawed. The model will never be real enough, with diminished sensations of social presence, textures, sounds and smells etc. whilst also reproducing the limitations of the real world. These findings will feed into the PI's next AHRC funded project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Feminist  spaces  and  digital  methodologies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>617EDE8E-1442-4F9C-9BA9-B952663BE168</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CCN+ SusNet Co-I Aristea Fotopoulou presented the paper 'Feminist spaces and digital methodologies: Mapping reproductive technologies as a social controversy online,' at the FWSA 2013 conference 'The Lady Doth Protest: Mapping 4 Feminist Movements, Moments and Mobilisations', 21 - 23 June 2013 (Feminist and Women's Studies Association, UK &amp;amp; Ireland).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Photo-genic practices: photography as interface</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E570B657-A36D-4111-BCC4-2962952E0D54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CCN+ Research Fellow, Edgar Gomez Cruz, presented this paper as part of the panel 'Non-Professional Photography: Practices and Power' at the Helsinki Photomedia conference 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>StoryStorm Edinburgh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>602B94FE-BDAA-4DF9-9D1E-8EE9CC379DE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CCN+ StoryStorm Network is partnering with the EPSRC RIDERS and CIRCLE networks to deliver a workshop at University of Edinburgh on April 30th.

This presentation, at THT's main offices, was attended by over 25 regional and head office stakeholders, included a guided conversation through the key research findings and a tour of the new website. Following on from this information dissemination, health professionals were invited to undertake a training event that helped them to put some of the key findings into practice. It is envisaged that further training events at regional offices will be held in the next 12 months. 



THT were extremely enthusiastic about the findings and will use the research in their negotiations with clinical commissioning groups and the NHS.

The project partner, Terrence Higgins Trust, will benefit from the findings of the Reaching out Online project by being able to use this data in their negotiations with clinical commision bodies and the NHS.

Beneficiaries: Terrence Higgins Trust

Contribution Method: The research identified the impact that digital migration had on workers' (and

service users') perceptions of HIV community outreach work. In contrast to general assumptions that digital work can offer a 'quick fix' for health promotion, health workers often have to develop deep and lasting relationships with users of a site, regularly engaging in nonhealth-related discussions and 'chat' in order to build trust and social

capital among the community. The disembodied nature of online community outreach work results in deeper and more honest disclosure by service users. This allows outreach workers to provide information, knowledge and support that is more closely aligned with the situations and predicaments that service users find themselves in. Owing to the depth of such disclosure, health workers require more detailed knowledge of sexual health when working online, and working in a group setting (offline) can aid in

developing this.



Further key findings are detailed in the final report for this project, available at http://www.communitiesandculture.org/files/2013/07/Reaching-Out-Online-Final-Report.pdf

Personalised Health and Care 2020 (November 2015) sets out a framework for digital technologies with a bold ambition:

One of the greatest opportunities of the 21st century is the potential to safely harness the power of the technology revolution, which has transformed our society, to meet the challenges of improving health and providing better, safer, sustainable care for all. To date the health and care system has only begun to exploit the potential of using data and technology at a national or local level. Our ambition is for a health and care system that enables people to make healthier choices, to be more resilient, to deal more effectively with illness and disability when it arises, and to have happier, longer lives in old age; a health and care system where technology can help tackle inequalities and improve access to services for the vulnerable.

But in our rush to embrace digital technologies, are we paying proper attention to the implications for all of us as patients and citizens? What does digitally transformed health and care mean for privacy and surveillance? Who benefits and who might get left behind from the so called 'digital revolution' in health and care? How do we elide patient/citizen choice with professional expertise?

This session aimed to bring people with an interest in the topic to start a conversation. We hope that it will result a regular meet up of interested people and bridge a dialogue across disciplines and sectors and was aimed at academics, people accessing health and care services, practitioners, digital innovators and anyone else with an interest in this topic.

The session was hosted by Victoria Betton, director of digital health programme mHabitat and PhD student at the School of Media and Communications; Dr Helen Thornham, Associate Professor Digital Cultures at the School of Media and Communications; Dr Ian Kellar, Associate Professor and lead for behaviour change at the School of Psychology; Imran Ali, Founder of Carbon Engineering and Living Lab, with an interest in emerging technologies.

engagement with rural craftspeople.
- Many project participants have now developed websites which they are happy with, and are engaging with broader networks through social media channels such as Twitter and Wordpress: &amp;quot;The Wordpress workshop provided me with new information, courage and confidence to create my own website and realise I can do it on my own&amp;quot;.
- The project brought together members of different practice-based communities into one group: &amp;quot;it's a varied group of different people it's quite interesting to hear from different sides how they would go about doing it, and then put that into practice in your own work.&amp;quot; Strong ties have been formed within the group which have led to mutual benefit between members, for example in collaborating in the recent North East Open Studios (NEOS) - for example by sharing venues and exhibiting spaces. These ties are maintained and developed through a Facebook group for participants, which was created by participants after they had the idea at one of the workshops.
- Our non-academic partners (SSW, Talk About Local and Make Aberdeen) gained a deeper understanding of the ways that social media and digital technologies can support the practices of craftspeople and makers - something that they will use to inform their work with practitioners in the future: &amp;quot;people at the end of [the workshops] were very, very interested. It obviously struck a chord, it's something that's needed in these rural environments, and people are super up for it because they see there is an impact for their work - be it through the selling of jewellery production, or through the engagement with communities further afield.&amp;quot; (Nuno Sacramento, SSW).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;Beyond clicks&quot;, a framework to study digital media practices: two ethnographic examples.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>281867B5-3927-4E4B-B61A-DFBF253872A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Thornham, H. y G&amp;oacute;mez Cruz, E.

However permanent urban screens are costly to set up and maintain. Showing advertisements offers a means for urban screens to become financially viable, yet artists, critics, and theorists contend that giving urban screens over to advertising diminishes the public environment. The argument for keeping urban screens in the public realm would be boosted by deeper understanding of how urban screens generate social capital by engaging with local communities. Yet processes for achieving this are rarely described. 



An understanding of techniques and approaches used by urban screens to engage with communities was acquired through a case study of the BBC Big Screen Network. This included interviews with BBC Big Screen Managers, local authority Screen Officers, and community collaborators. To understand similarities and differences in approaches to engaging communities, we then analysed two urban screen projects in terms of the outcomes of this case study. Preece and Schneiderman's Reader-Leader framework for understanding motivations behind online participation provided additional insights for this work.



Our findings suggest that urban screens act as social and spatial thresholds. These thresholds extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the screen into areas and communities not physically connected to the screen site. Techniques used to engage communities include consideration of the screen's spatial and social setting when programming screen content, focusing on locally relevant content and collaborating with communities to create content.



We believe the potential for urban screens to engage with local communities and generate social capital depends on the desire and ability of screen managers to understand and embed urban screens in the broader social, spatial, cultural, and economic environment in which the screen is situated.

It has recently become clear that many communities in rural areas cannot rely on BT to service them. It is uneconomical to provide fast broadband connections so the company has been slow to expand into these areas. MPs and Ofcom have both slammed its approach but their complaints have not come to much in the way of action. In many ways, these areas actually need broadband more than cities. A lack of public transportation and the dispersed population makes the need for internet connectivity all the more important. With government services such as welfare, agricultural reporting, and tax returns all going online, and an aging population dependent on the shrinking resources of the NHS, residents in these areas are hit in more ways than one by the lack of infrastructure. Bypassed by the big broadband providers, some of these communities have mobilised their own resources to set up broadband connections and a number of different models for doing so have emerged. They show that there is an alternative to BT, if you're willing to put the work in.

Paper title: Onlife Ethnography: Researching Technologically Mediated Worlds

GeoSpock is a technology start-up that has developed a more secure method of using GPS software than that currently used by app developers. Dr Mowlabocus was contacted by GeoSpock in the wake of news reports that identified Grindr (the UK's most popular gay male dating app) as being 'hacked', with user's location data being made available. This 'hack' identified the poor security employed by the software developers and the danger that this posed for users living in homophobic contexts around the world. Dr Mowlabocus was invited to comment on this security breach by editors at The Conversation. Following the publication of this article, GeoSpock contacted Dr Mowlabocus to request further information about his research. GeoSpock have developed an alternative to Grindr, named GiFi. Working in a similar way to Grindr and other applications for gay men, GiFi offers further functionality (including community group involvement) and provides enhanced security options for users. The company are interested in using its technology to support gay men's health initiatives and where therefore interested in learning more about Reaching out Online.

Dr Mowlabocus was able to provide GeoSpok with a presentation that matched up the research findings of the original project with some of the aims and objectives of GiFi. In doing so, he was able to identify the challenges and opportunities that face GeoSpock in developing a relationship with third-sector organisations charged with improving gay men's health. Following the meeting, Dr Mowlabocus has acted as a liaison point between GeoSpock and Terrence Higgins Trust, both of whom are now in discussions regarding a possible future collaboration. Reflecting upon the workshop and discussion, Kristian Tangen-Sorgendal (Business Development Manager) stated that the event 'proved extremely interesting' and that as a result of the meeting, the company were 'extremely keen to progress on talks with THT and how our unique focus in the LGBT Community can help broaden the good work covered by this wonderful charity.' This discussion is ongoing and Dr Mowlabocus has been central to facilitating these conversations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Everyday Growing Cultures in the North of England: participation, citizenship and local economies</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D40A9554-5B3C-43CB-BC9C-D78824D2580A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CCN+ Mapping the Transformations Symposium @ University of Sussex

These Collaborative Encounter events experimented with the co-creation of knowledge as a means of evaluating the potential of digital communities to enable and enact socio-cultural and/or political change. Prior to the workshop each participant was asked to provide written comment on three key questions: Who are the indebted? What needs to change? How do we bring about this change? These questions sought to stimulate participants into thinking in advance about the key issues surrounding debt, and to highlight key forms of specialist knowledge. Throughout the day participants made posters and commented on those made by others. The use of posters provided a visual way to represent the key issues and topics on the workshop agenda. In doing so tried to facilitate new ways, and always in conversation with research partners, how and when social research can be culturally and socially transformative.


Many workshop participants noted it would be useful to create a digital space for these types of interactions. In response the project team uploaded key texts, anonymized, and work products were posted as blog (http://alternatives2debteconomy.tumblr.com/).
Key impacts from these events were the forging and fostering of important working relationships within the Knowledge Exchange network. Different actors in the space of campaigning against debt or financial inclusion, they came together to meet and discuss how to shape wider political engagement. Therefore, these workshops became - through the actions of the participants themselves - a major contribution to the fostering of relationships between the network of actors, through multiple organisations, to work toward the a common goal.
One example, is the key relationship created at Collaborative Encounters workshop with Debt Resistance UK, which led to participants contributing chapters to forthcoming Debt Resistors User Manuel UK.
Another key impact-related events from this project emerged when network actors contributed to call for evidence by the Financial Conduct Authority on the cap on the cost of credit. In turn, these contributions was debated in the series of blogs based around the project. Interviews with press media that were in turn informed about the Knowledge Exchange and the wider project, including Bloomberg, The Independent, The Guardian and Radio 4.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Writing Leeds films online</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54FBC7DC-3BD0-41D8-A6F5-D919FC98C0D0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>So far the response from these film has been fantastic.

Digital transformations of communities and culture are hugely affected by the austerity measures and welfare reforms. Firstly the austerity measures have produced severe cuts across the sectors we primarily engage with (third &amp;amp; public sectors), which has meant that regardless of technological innovation, if there is insufficient resources to implement change, transformation will not happen. Secondly, there is at the same time and increased pressure to use digital technology as a cost effective means of engagement. This has produced a real lived tension between organizational pressure to embrace digital, and a lack of means to engage. All our work to date has therefore necessarily engaged with complex, specific and general organizational, lived and technological process and practices.

2. The cuts to the public and third sectors, in addition to the Localism initiative of the current government have increasingly fragmented resources that have traditionally helped or sustained communities: public sector representatives talk about an increasing 'lag' between services (social, youth, homeless, food aid, education, health, civic). At the same time, the digital initiatives, which generally try to map or connect services, face problematic ethical and security issues. Quite often the underpinning support services for communities have insufficient resources to cope with an increase in demand, so making them visible via digital technologies is problematic, as is the sharing of sensitive data, which is still plagued by security issues. There is a real question, then, about transforming these sectors through digital technologies that goes beyond 'simple' top down design or innovation.

3. The communities that are benefitting from digital innovations are middle-upper class, consumerist communities in specific locations. This is because much innovation is directed at a consumerist neoliberal model, and those with income can benefit. Smart home technology, personal devices, mobile technologies, smart bins may all enable these communities, but they do so in very particular ways.

4. At the same time, the third sector and public sector communities we engage with, express deep concern that issues of responsibility, welfare, civic duty are being erased from these sectors, leaving only a consumerist neoliberal model. The increased pressure to embrace partnerships and decentre resources have produced a vacuum in terms of who is actually responsible for civic or welfare issues. Wider discourses of 'resilient' or 'sustainable' communities celebrate activities that also work to de-politicize or a-politicize these issues. 

5. Our current task as we see it, is to work towards an ethically robust technologically-orientated solution that engages with these issues. For our Network+, designing technology without consideration of these lived realities does not move us forward. Our current call will hopefully work towards this. There is increased interest in technologically innovative solutions because of the pressure to engage, which has opened up real possibilities for impactful engagement. However, we need to deal with the issues as a whole: if we were just to focus on design over implementation or ethical consideration, we would simply be adding to the noise, and repeating the mistakes of the past.

It is currenlty being used by local councils nationally to underpin their changes to using digital means of engagement. 

It fed into a number of consultations within Leeds council, such as the Community Centre Review (2012-13) and the consultation on Youth Services (2013), and Budget Review (2013). The Sussex Scope fed back to OfCom. The interim reports have targeted a number of public sector organisations such as Leeds, Trafford and Sheffield Councils, local communities such as FeedLeeds, Feeding Manchester, Grow Sheffield, the Kindling Trust and Open Data Communities as well as local growing communities such as guerilla gardening and allotment plot holders. The scope reports have been exploited in a number of ways. The Leeds scope report has been circulated within Leeds Council (see below) and to other councils nationally, It has fed into a number of consultations. It has also been used as a pilot project for further grant applications to develop key aspects, and exploited through academic publications (see outcomes section).The Sussex scope has fed into OfCom and to the local organisations, which it engaged. The Interim reports have been used by a variety of local, third sector and public sector organisations through consultations and workshops and publicised using social media and traditional publications. The outputs noted in the related sections within ROS detail their incredible impact. All the reports are published in our working papers series and used to underpin the core activities of the Network+.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8829157F-C293-4826-B0F4-A10B127CF393</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government/ Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.communitiesandculture.org/projects/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Findings submitted to MIND to inform BLF-funded peer-support programme</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F81FF14C-AE66-4BA2-A476-2C2538E665C6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Findings submitted to All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into hunger and food poverty</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EAF78391-E2AC-4DFC-8923-C2128D0DF50E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hyperlocal Government Engagement Online</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>891FB48B-2790-4A7D-B565-7620CCB7A4D2</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>'Digital by Default' strand policy recommendations submitted to Science and Technology Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C4B198B5-49E6-4328-9430-43F99661D583</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This report was also submitted to Ofcom and to all of the public and third sector organisations involved in this strand of the network's activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://2plqyp1e0nbi44cllfr7pbor.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/files/2013/01/Digital-By-Default-Report-CCN.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Living with Food Insecurity: Informing Public and Third Sector Organizations</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A47B9457-16CD-4E88-BF4F-27F8B9FD3793</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Research conducted as part of the CCN+ study 'Living with Food Insecurity' has informed the on-going research by Oxfam, Church Action on Poverty and Child Poverty Action Group.

The first was a partner-specific report, summarising what data the analytics experiments generated about each partner organisation. The second report was a general guide to tools.



Key contacts in the partner organisations report that both the reports and the attendance of some of their staff at our end-of-project workshop have fed into the drafting of their social media policies. In this respect, the knowledge of digital data analysis tools which DDA facilitated was particularly useful, according to our key contacts. 



A Leeds City Council contact has said:

&amp;quot;&amp;quot;We introduced wider use of the free tools mentioned in the report and now use campaign feedback including social media reach and comparisons, look at who influencers are etc. We now also have a checklist and new social media account approval process that ask folk how they intend to prove the value of social media use before they set accounts up. We now also have a digital access team and they are responsible for our perceived ?corporate accounts? (not service accounts) and they have used the report as a basis for some follow up work which is currently looking at data tools that would help with our customer services insight.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;



Sheffield City Council communications team held workshops based on our general guide to tools, to introduce the staff in the team to a range of available digital data analysis tools. One of these staff members has since gone to work for Barnsley Council and is using this information as part of her role there.



Leeds City Museums has since taken a more proactive approach to using social media, organising awareness raising and training sessions for staff in the use and benefits of social media, weekly bulletins to gather content for channels and many more staff are now engaged and contributing content.

Within the constraints of the resource there are some indications that this approach may function in this way. Nevertheless, it is difficult to assess the radical or utopian dimensions of the knowledge and outputs. Thus a question we continued to ask during the research was whether or not using design fiction produced insights and ideas into community based tax systems that could not have been gleaned by a relatively intelligent person sitting and thinking. Reflecting on the project and the ideas generated we do not think this was achieved. This question, however, arguably obscures a more interesting purpose of co-producing design fiction in encouraging communities to have more interesting conversations about developing alternative and preferable futures. Thus the significant questions are not how to make tax visible in communities but rather to encourage people in communities to consider different types of communities, the relationships and obligations between citizens and within that alternative configurations of tax collection and expenditure. In the discussions the crucial dimension will be to engender the desire for a better way of being or living and then the collective engagement to make the world otherwise (Levitas 2013).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Sans Duty Design Fiction Methodology</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This pilot project has investigated user engagement and interaction with 3D visualisations of heritage sites.

The scan was compiled and rendered and made available for viewing through open source technology (Meshlab, on both laptop and iPad) and used as a basis for the social research. The technical findings of the project were that the new scanners allowed for sites to be captured more quickly, in better detail and were much more user friendly than laser scanners used by the project team in the past. 

Visualisations were easily produced but integrating data into the scans proved to be more difficult.

The digital technologies employed were restricted to relatively user-friendly and cost-effective software and hardware to investigate the feasibility of this process for non-experts such as museum staff. Three key techniques were used to create the shape of the model (known as its mesh): photogrammetry using digital cameras; laser measurement photogrammetry using an iPad and a Structure Sensor; and architectural drawing. The majority of the MERL buildings were modelled along with nine objects. These ranged in size, shape and materials to test the digital scanning technologies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8E28248-23BA-44DE-8798-4143ADF5193A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Revizto, the software used to bring together the various parts of the model (architecture, objects and additional information) and make it navigable, heard of the project through Twitter and contacted IE to write a case study and suggest ways the software could be developed to suit this type of application.

For example, the toolkit explains how we used the Freedom of Information Act to collect data for allotments across the UK. At a more local level, if you are interested in setting up a growing project on a plot of unused land in your neighbourhood, how you might go about finding out who owns the land. And then, how you could start sharing your vision with others. Please see the full set of options in the top right corner.

Although the toolkit is presented in a sequence, in principle assuming you may want to start from scratch (getting started), this may not be true for everybody or may only be true for a few people. In fact, we suspect most people may only be interested in sections of this toolkit. That's fine. It's up to you how you use it. We hope it is useful and are interested in hearing how you've used it. So please let us know by getting in touch with us or by filling out the form below. If you have suggestions about how we might improve this toolkit, we'd love to hear about that too!</gtr:description><gtr:id>290DC9B1-8987-43E1-8306-1379535D3981</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Everyday Growing Cultures Toolkit</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/66EE7CDE-C29F-4F43-8F25-4FE2E6C7094A"><gtr:id>66EE7CDE-C29F-4F43-8F25-4FE2E6C7094A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Community Broadband Initiatives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/15ef66af8a920720af1ff991b8c3c335"><gtr:id>15ef66af8a920720af1ff991b8c3c335</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Claire Wallace (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/656FB664-FBCC-47F8-AD9F-D73209E8748E"><gtr:id>656FB664-FBCC-47F8-AD9F-D73209E8748E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Everyday Growing Cultures in the North of England: Participation, Citizenship and Local Economies.
