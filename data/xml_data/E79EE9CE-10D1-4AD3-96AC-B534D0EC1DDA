These estimates are primarily derived from space geodetic (altimetry or time-variable gravity) measurements, with time-variable gravity data from the GRACE satellite mission the only technique capable of determining ice mass balance for the entire ice sheet. Accurate correction of total mass change (measured by GRACE) to obtain ice mass change is, however, complicated by a lack of confidence in accurately correcting for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). Indeed, recent published estimates of ice mass change for West Antarctica are swamped by the present uncertainty in GIA models. Global Positioning System (GPS) time series offer important constraints on GIA and, indeed, have been installed in many of the critical locations. However, the current network of GPS sites, whilst allowing separation of wildly different GIA models, is too sparse to provide the tight constraints required for producing improved models / for that a high spatial resolution of GPS sites is required. In particular, the southern Antarctic Peninsula/Ronne Ice Shelf contains a very large GRACE signal, but the current station density there is too sparse to unambiguously determine the origin of the gravity change. Further suitable rock outcrops are available in this region for additional data collection and situating there new, more densely spaced, continuous sites would provide the required constraints. Here, we propose to place improved constraints on an Antarctic GIA model through newly collected GPS-data, thereby allowing us to compute new accurate and precise estimates of ice mass contributions to sea level rise from West Antarctica.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>39593</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Durham University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Geography</gtr:department><gtr:description>Durham LGM Antarctica</gtr:description><gtr:id>C87564A1-38A6-4939-B045-4D1C30FEE864</gtr:id><gtr:impact>BAS have completed the geophysical surveys.

This motion is a response to changes in ice-loading since the last glacial maximum. The land should be moving up, because the ice load has decreased over several thousand years. The upwards vertical motion rates were much smaller than expected, meaning that we have had to revise our views on the timing of the deglaciation of Antarctica. In several locations we identified recent unstable advance of the Antarctic ice-sheet as the most likely cause of the unexpectedly low uplift rates. This ice-sheet advance was a likely explanation of results from one particular GPS station, which showed the land-surface moving downwards.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Further research into Antarctic deglaciation</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2851CCE8-61D2-4C32-8E26-8BE5B69CE82D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In the 1970s several papers were published pointing out that if ice-flux across the grounding-line (the origin of the floating ice-shelf) increased with ice thickness, then grounding-lines situated on locations where the bed deepened up-glacier (has a 'reverse slope'), the situation was potentially unstable. For example, a small retreat of the grounding line would increase ice-flux, causing the ice-sheet to lose volume and induce further retreat of the grounding line. In contrast, a small advance would reduce ice-flux, allowing the ice-sheet to gain volume and result in more advance. These ideas had to wait until 2007 before they were given a rigorous mathematical footing by Schoof.

Schoof gave a formula for flux as a function of thickness, which allowed the testing of numerical models. Two model intercomparisons have been carried out, both lead-authored by Frank Pattyn, with DOI's 10.5194/tc-6-573-2012 and 10.3189/2013JoG12J129. Richard Hindmarsh participated in these intercomparisons. We now have greatly increased confidence in the ability of numerical models to accurately compute grounding-line migration.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4150C120-37C9-4653-A359-E7BA3E53E018</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Greatly increased confidence in the numerical simulations of grounding line motion.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Modelling ice-sheet grounding-line migration</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2012</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The grounding-line (GL) of a marine ice-sheet is the location where the ice has thinned with flow to reach the flotation thickness. Therefore, the GL indicates where an ice-shelf commences. Ice flux across the GL increases with the thickness of the ice, and recent theoretical work indicates that flux is proportional to the thickness to a power between four and five. These considerations led to the idea that a GL on a reverse slope (sloping inwards) is dynamically unstable, i.e. sensitive to the operation of feedbacks, since a retreat of the GL would lead to greater ice flux and further retreat. In contrast, an advance would lead to lower ice flux and further advance. 

An early discovery in glacial geology was the association of uplift of the earth surface with the retreat of large ice-sheets, owing to the unloading. For marine ice-sheets, such uplift means a further source of change in the ice-thickness at the grounding-line. Our discovery was that such shallowing can turn the unstable retreat of a marine ice-sheet into an unstable advance. This was used to explain some anomalous measurements of uplift from Antarctica, undertaken by recently installed continuous GPS stations. The anomalous results are either very slow rates of uplift, or in one case, downwards motion. The cause of these was attributed to reloading by ice, due to plausibly unstable GL readvance in the Weddell Sea sector of the the West Antarctic ice-sheet over the past 4000 years.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA890433-7171-491A-8064-3D1404C7DED9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication of two papers
