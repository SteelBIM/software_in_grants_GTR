The study will evaluate and reflect on the impacts these projects have had both in relation to the communities engaged in the projects and the degree to which they have come to stimulate research and cultural activities in new community settings. 
The projects involved in this legacy project are: Exploring Personal Communities: A Review of Volunteering Processes (AH/J012238/1); Bridging the gap between academic rigour and community relevance (AH/K006185/1); and Untold Stories of Volunteering: A Cultural Animation Project (AH/K006576/1), all led by Mihaela Kelemen and conducted in collaboration with New Vic Theatre, Newcastle under Lyme, and 'Revisiting the Midpoint of British Community Studies' (AH/J006920/1) led by Martin Phillips and conducted in collaboration with Glossop Heritage Trust and High Peaks Community Arts. 
The first three projects are based on animative (theatre-based) methodologies and have resulted in the creation of documentary/interactive dramas on volunteering, mini-performances about community, and an audio-visual installation that aims to bridge the gap between academic theory and community relevance. The final project embraces an iterative methodology and has led to the development of Glossopoly, a game that acts as a means of illustrating the outcome of the research, as a method for conducting community research and as a mechanism for stimulating wider debates about community amongst community members, practitioners and policy makers/planners. 
This legacy project will evaluate the impact of three cultural outputs associated with its constituent projects, namely: The untold story of volunteering drama performance, The Boat audio-visual installation, and Glossopoly. Evaluations will focus on individuals and organisations who took part in the original research, as well as policy makers, community practitioners, academics and community members who were not part of the original research but have expressed interest in this research. Evidence will be gathered through narratives, testimonies, and experiential reflections before and after exposure to these outputs. We will use animative and iterative methodologies for collecting the data and this will be supplemented by formal evaluative techniques brought to the project by National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) who has been a partner on one of the original projects.
The project will also map out the trajectory and growth of partnerships that have been formed in association with the four original research projects. These include interactions between academics, between academics and community partners/institutional stakeholders, between community partners, and between community partners and community members. The resulting partnership map will encapsulate reflections, stories and artefacts co-produced with all the parties involved in this research.
Finally, the project aims to up scale the uptake of animative and iterative methodologies across a range of individuals, groups and organisations via a showcase event held in Leicester, a workshop held at the Locality Annual Summer Camp for Community Organisers and a workshop held at the Department of Communities and Local Government, London. The project will also benefit from international expertise on sustainability and community research through the involvement of Professor Tima Bansal, from Western Ontario University, Canada, her research and practitioner networks and City of Markham's (Toronto) community outreach team.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>It is expected that the following groups or organisations would accrue benefits from this research:

Academic community: see Academic Beneficiaries section.

Local community groups and residents. The projects that form the focus of this legacy project have already engaged a wide range of community groups, policy makers and community members (see Pathways to Impact Document), many of whom have expressed an interest in continuing their involvement to this new project. In addition this project will engage with a series of new local community groups and residents, including RODSEC (Rolleston on Dove) and Green:Keele, and will seek to engage more local community groups and organisations through showcasing the outputs and methodologies adopted in four earlier Connected Communities projects. These groups and people will gain skills, resources and experience of animative and iterative community research, as well cultural outputs and partnership connections that they can potentially use to further their own interests and objectives.

National community organisations. National community organisations such as the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Voice4Change and the Community Development Foundation have been involved in earlier projects and have expressed an interest in continuing their engagement into this legacy evaluation. In addition this new project will involve people from national organisations, including Locality, which is a key player in the Government's 'Big Society' and Localism' agendas, as well as Iranian and Kurdish Women Rights Organisation, Safety City Partnership, the Youth Offending Services and the Holocaust Survivors Friendship Association. The organisations will learn about and gain experience in the use of animative and iterative methods in community research that they can potentially employ in their community engagement related practice.

National and Local Government. The Department of Communities and Local Government, via its VCS Partnership Board, is keen to use cultural animation techniques to enthuse and support groups/organisations to engage with the 'Community rights' legislation by making it relevant to their day to day life and immediate concerns. The Department will also host a workshop in which various local authorities and community based organisations will be introduced to animative and iterative methodologies as means for improving engagement with their local communities.

International organisations. The project seeks to explore the relevance of the cultural animation and iterative methods to academics, local and national community groups and community policy makers and practitioners in countries beyond the UK. Specifically, the project team will meet with academics from Western Ontario University and representatives of community groups and policy makers in Markham, Canada. These will include officials in the City of Markham and members of the Network for Business Sustainability, Canada, and the Centre for Building Sustainable Value, Canada. The organisations and individuals will learn about and gain experience in the use of animative and iterative community research, as well as gain an understanding of the character of research outputs and partnerships created through involvement in the AHRC's Connected Communities programme.

AHRC Connected Communities Programme. The project will be of value to this research programme both by assessing and promoting the legacy of four specific projects in terms of their methodologies, cultural outputs and partnership connections, but also through developing a contextual, three dimensional perspective on legacy that could potentially be applied to other projects within the programme.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-18</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>83948</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Over 500 people had the opportunity to experience the CASIC exhibition held in Chancellors Building in october 2015 and curated by Kerry Jones, Keele's Arts Officer. The exhibition entitled 'Look and look again' comprises installations, film, music and photographs that celebrate the creativity and ground-breaking nature of the knowledge co-produced in collaborative research by CASIC academics and community partners.
It also featured a number of interactive workshops starting with a moving audiovisual and multichannel concert about the lost industries of Stoke on Trent and the present hope and creativity of its inhabitants, with compositions by Professor Rajmil Fishman, Dr. Diego Garro and Dr Steve Bird. This was followed by an inspiring talk about the interactive Dorothy Richardson online exhibition by Professor Scott McCracken and Dr. Rebecca Bowler, and a jazz-philosophy fusion workshop run by Dr. James Tartaglia who played his saxophone and involved the audience in contemplating Schopenhauer's philosophy while singing along to co-produce a new piece of jazz-philosophy work. The audience also enjoyed some creative writing and homemade ice-cream, courtesy of the literary caf&amp;eacute; run by Dr. Ceri Morgan and led by emergency poet, Deborah Alma. The programme ended with a participatory workshop run by Dr. Gemma Burford from Brighton University, the winner of the first CASIC working papers series prize. Throughout the day, participants were invited to visit the KAVE in the School of pharmacy and experience a 'health in the community' immersive workshop. This virtual environment provided an exciting and provocative opportunity for participants to explore the 'meaning of health' using a virtual environment designed by Luke Bracegirdle (School of Pharmacy) and incorporating findings from previous research funded by the AHRC and EPRC. During the day, creative experts and animateurs from the New Vic Borderlines team ran cultural animation workshops in the Chancellor Building, bringing to life the artefacts and the stories of the CASIC exhibition.</gtr:description><gtr:id>24641FF9-ABB8-4DDB-98CD-3841C78040B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>widened engagement with the local community for Keele University</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Look and Look Again CASIC Exhibition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjl3Hl7FA1o&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLm6S_-wsxg6DNmYEOLC5LEbhGSF9gnC9J</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This CASIC installation was part of the 'Back to the drawing board' exhibition and ran from November 23rd until January 16th. The installation contained a projection of Peter Rice's mural, Bridgewater artefacts, ordinary day to day objects, empty frames, voice overs and musical documentaries made by diverse communities which took part in previous CASIC research projects. Using Cultural Animation techniques of community engagement and knowledge co-production pioneered in the UK by Sue Moffat, Founding Director of New Vic Borderlines and developed further via the Connected Communities research, participants were encouraged to create and visualise a bright future for Stoke on Trent by filling empty frames with their own ideas and aspirations, drawing themselves in the projection, imagining conversations that will take place in the future, and writing haikus and cinquans about their aspirations, wishes and ambitions for Stoke on Trent. This living and interactive installation acted as a bridge between past, present and future and as a boundary object that can unite communities around ideas about the future.
On November, 23rd, a steady stream of community members, students and staff came to visit the CASIC installation and take part in interactive workshops. Four theatre practitioners from the New Vic Boderlines encouraged participants to paint tea towels in the Pat Albeck's tradition, write haikus about their relationship with Stoke on Trent and put themselves in the projection of a mural by Peter Rice entitled 'A Bright Past for Stoke-on-Trent'. The discussions about Stoke and its impact on one's individual and collective identity have been fascinating. The created artifacts have been added to the installation and captured in picture and video form.</gtr:description><gtr:id>69CCAA36-D1EF-4C38-B9E8-77286136305E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Change of views regarding the past and present of Stoke on Trent

The closure of a factory, coal mine or shipyard can, of course, devastate a whole community. As part of the Arts and Humanities Research Council's Connected Communities Programme one project is discovering more about the stories and experiences of people who have faced such adversity. The work will help different types of communities deal with similar challenges in the future.

It also makes use of the philosophy of American Pragmatism, that there should be no division between academic knowledge and practical experience. Workshops include the use of a boat installation and creative activities.

Participants worked collaboratively to explore what health meant for their communities and created models of ideal communities using artifacts and theatrical props provided by the New Vic Theatre. Sue Moffat and her team of theatre practitioners from the New Vic Borderlines ran a number of activities prior to the event capturing stories of health in various community venues such as schools, community centres and food banks. Parallel cultural animation activities took place on the day in Darwin Building, on the Keele grounds where a health tent was erected and in the KAVE (School of Pharmacy) where Luke Bracegirdle designed a virtual health environment. The latter incorporated findings co-produced with communities in previous research projects carried out by Mihaela Kelemen (KMS), Rajmil Fischman (Music) and Emma Surman (KMS). The workshop stimulated community-academia debate as well as personal and collective reflection on the meanings health in the diverse communities of Stoke on Trent, providing also a fertile ground for enhancing community assets and connections with academia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/connectedcommunitiesfestival/healthcommunity/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Untold Stories of Voluntering Workshop for BigLocal</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7301B954-7AA9-41BA-A57F-E42FA3EA98C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On September 25, 2014, we held an interactive workshop and presentation on Volunteering at the National Association of Neighborhood Management/Big Local event, in Stoke-on-Trent.

The talk reported on the main findings of the project and was followed by an interactive workshop that used cultural animation techniques (developed by the New Vic Theatre, our community partner) to encourage people to think differently about cities in crisis and the ways in which we need to approach such crises at an individual and collective level.

After my talk, participants reported that the interactive workshop provided a fresh perspective in techniques for researching with communities.

The first discussed the challenges of HEIs in supporting regional business growth across traditional manufacturing industries as well as new start-ups in sectors. As the Turku region has managed to retain internationally competitive ship-building capabilities as well as being home to online gaming companies, participants drew parallels with the current situation in the Stoke-on Trent area.
The second roundtable focused on Culture, Arts and Higher Education and centered on Professor Kelemen's presentation of the achievements and aspirations of the Community Animation and Social Innovation Centre (CASIC). Both events attracted a diverse audience of practitioners and academics who engaged in a lively exchange of ideas and practices across the two countries. Professor Kelemen also presented her Connected Communities research findings to PhD students from the Human Research Department, while Professor Allman visited the Boost Incubator, whilst only 7 months old, was already incubating pre-start ups and born-global businesses.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Experiential workshop on sustainability in collaboration with GreenKeele</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F14344A-42E6-4338-BD50-F0EA3DD4AD83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Thirty participants (students and academics) attended a cultural animation workshop in which we debated the meanings of sustainability and constructed new worlds out of ordinary materials available all around us.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/pastevents/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Food Festival, Middleport Potteries</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F9535F6-F90A-4B3B-A3B6-EFDEFE516A82</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 500 people from across North Staffordshire gathered at Middleport Pottery on June 28th, 2015 for the Connected Communities Food Festival.

University and its wider community, emphasised the central role CASIC plays in building 

capacity for community-centered solutions to local and global issues. CASIC's main 

ambition is to expand the co-production of knowledge with community members in order to 

facilitate social innovation and bring about democratic changes in society.

The ground-breaking work undertaken by CASIC was recognised by a number of high profile 

speakers including AHRC Associate Director Gary Grubb who shared his vision about 

CASIC's future prospects for creative, cross-disciplinary, and community co-produced 

research. The Connected Communities Leadership Fellow, Professor Keri Facer from Bristol 

University praised the uniqueness of CASIC in the academic world, inviting the audience to 

rethink research in the age of collaboration, interdisciplinarity and precarity, while Professor 

Kate Pahl from Sheffield University shared her views on why centres such as CASIC are key 

to improving the social conditions of individuals and their communities through the 

application of co-created knowledge.

The Chief Executive and Artistic Director of the New Vic Theatre, Staffordshire, a founding 

partner of CASIC, gave a completing talk about the history of the New Vic and its 

relationships with the local community and the university. The audience then participated in a 

panel discussion with practitioners from the National Council of Voluntary Organisations

research and from universities in general. 

The first day closed with two inspiring addresses: the first from Dr. Lai Yong Tan, director of 

outreach and community engagement at the College of Alice and Peter Tan, NUS. He 

mesmerised the audience with his stories about community engagement in the Yunnan 

Province, where he spent 15 years, training and educating community doctors in very remote 

villages. In the final talk, Dr. Aki Koponen, Director of the Finnish Centre for Collaborative 

Research at the University of Turku stressed the significance of the relationship between his

Professor David Shepherd, the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences welcomed the participants and gave a short overview of CASIC, re-iterating the centrality of community based research and knowledge co-production, to the strategic plan of the University. His welcome address was followed by a talk given by CASIC Director, Professor Mihaela Kelemen (KMS), who emphasised that the main ambitions of CASIC are to dissolve the boundaries between academia and its wider community and to embrace a way of working and researching that recognises that common-sense, experience and day to day creativity are as important as academic expertise in the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Sue Moffat, Director of New Vic Borderlines, invited participants to experience Cultural Animation Methodologies of knowledge co-production and community engagement. Some groups wrote and performed cinquains about community and research, whilst others worked together to create an installation by using ordinary objects, items, small frames and large frames to explore ways &amp;quot;to improve the social conditions of individuals and their communities through the application of knowledge that is co-created&amp;quot;. Participants were also invited to contribute haikus that expressed their own personal aspirations regarding CASIC to the 'Tree of life' while other participants experienced the 'Button exercise'. Buttons that represented The University and its Community had to be sorted as finely as possible, categorised and labelled with the view to create a map of the relationships that currently existed and then participants had to redraw an ideal version of the relationships and a CASIC charter.

Overall the Legacy Project has achieved a range of positive outcomes. For the original project teams there has been considerable learning as the methods and artefacts have lived through different iterations with different groups and have continued to evolve. At the same time new 'audiences' of community practitioners and researchers in the UK, Japan, Greece and Canada have also benefited. They have been challenged in their thinking and inspired to try new techniques to engage differently, more equally and more creatively, in their work with communities.
Power and potential of the methods - creativity, co-production and change
The project has tested and confirmed much that was previously suspected about the power and potential of the methods following the original research projects, and in so doing it has enabled us to add to understanding being developed elsewhere in the field about the value of different kinds of knowledge and about creative approaches to knowledge production and 'sense-making'. Echoing work taking place elsewhere in the growing field of creative research practice, through the project we have clearly confirmed that:
&amp;quot;creative practice can be a form of research in itself Inquiry through creative practice privileges such things as play, intuition, serendipity, imagination and the unexpected as resources for making sense.&amp;quot; 
The project has also confirmed the potential of the methods to create a more inclusive culture or practice of research where knowledge is co-produced for the benefit of the individuals and communities taking part; as well as the potential not only to change the way that researchers and others engage with communities, but also how communities themselves perceive and respond to the issues that face them.
&amp;quot;A fabulous way to explore ideas about community that results in a visual representation of our values and beliefs. At first was sceptical and at the end shocked by what a good, yet fun way of exploring our views on communities it was.&amp;quot;
Unanswered questions about the methods
We have identified some of the challenges of this way of working, including understanding different roles when working in a research/artist partnership; deciding what matters most in relation to process and outputs when delivering a creative research activity; and working with different ideas about what data is, who it needs to be useful for, and how it can be captured and represented. As the project draws to a close we are still left with some unanswered questions about some of the practicalities of how others might begin to use the methods in their work and how some of these challenges might best be overcome, but we have identified a number of important next steps that we believe might prove helpful in supporting more widespread take-up of the methods going forward.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. Produce a clearer description of the methods and how they work
We have talked in our report about the need for the project to not just &amp;quot;show&amp;quot; (the methods) but also to &amp;quot;tell&amp;quot;. However, the project team has so far not always found it easy to explain clearly to others outside the project what the methods comprise and how they work. In light of growing interest in the methods, and limited time or resources to continue with a very time-intensive demonstration model, it would seem timely now to develop a clearer way of describing them and also capturing the whole set of values, principles and techniques that sit behind the methods so as to create a description of an emerging methodology or methodologies (animative and iterative) as opposed to what could otherwise, without this important information, seem a loose collection of creative tools or techniques rather than a methodology. If the project team could find a plain English way to describe the methods, one that mirrors the ethos and values that underpin the methods themselves - eg, accessible, inclusive, levelling - we believe this would considerably help future engagement and understanding of both academic and non-academic audiences.

2. Build capacity by offering advice/support on the &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; of the methods
We identified a keen interest in practical support and advice or even training as a next step for building legacy, a real appetite for follow-up support and advice on the &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; side of things. If resources and advice could be developed where the methods could be explained and skills and confidence built to work with them, this would support wider adoption of the methods.
&amp;quot;The session was engaging but could have done with a bit more context and practical ideas about how this could be used in community settings and what the outcomes are for those who take part.&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Can I please have a copy of all stages as would love to use this?&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;Can we have access to the written steps / guides to each of the activities we experienced to apply to work with all ages as appropriate?&amp;quot;

3. Build and strengthen the network of those interested in the methods
The project has created a genuine excitement about the methods and a growing network of people interested in and trying out the ideas. We have not been able by any means to capture the extent of the ripples of change the project has contributed to as this was outside the remit of our particular element of the project, but we are aware of a growing list of contacts keen to know more and also aware that the project team have delivered many more workshops and activities based on the methods outside of the legacy project that have had similarly positive results. Continued engagement with and networking with those interested individuals would certainly be valuable in ensuring a longer-term legacy and wider adoption of and development of the methods. Feedback from one workshop participant, an academic, suggested that the project has been and could continue to be an important contributor to not just a shift in her thinking, but a wider shift in attitudes towards the value of working in partnership between researchers, artists and communities, and of using creative and innovative techniques to engage and conduct research in and with communities.
&amp;quot; there is something in the air at the moment - finding ways to work with people who are coming at a problem from a different background to university researchers, to produce good research, on equal terms (or as equal as we can manage) somehow, slowly these innovative techniques are making their way into university departments.&amp;quot;
As we write this report, it is exciting to conclude by noting that Keele University has recently demonstrated its own commitment to be a part of that shift in thinking about interdisciplinary and creative approaches to research with communities.

Last but not least - an important footnote - CASIC
In March 2015 Keele University launched a new Cultural Animation and Social Innovation Centre (CASIC) under the Directorship of Professor Mihaela Kelemen, the lead partner for this Legacy Project. More than 60 people attended the launch and many more again, this time from within and outside the UK, will attend the Centre's first international summit in October 2015. The Centre will see the original Connected Communities project partners and some of that growing network of people interested in the projects' methods coming together to share ideas and take forward plans for work that will continue to develop and share the methods further afield.

Among its ambitions the Centre aims:
 To develop interdisciplinary and creative solutions to complex issues based on a recognition that creativity is an equal partner in the scientific pursuit
 To foster local and global connections for action, to support social innovation and change. 

The establishment of this Centre, with these bold ambitions, gives us confidence that some of the ideas that have emerged from our work for ensuring a longer-term and living legacy might be considered even as this legacy project comes to an end. The launch of CASIC represents an exciting step for the methods and their proponents, and though not strictly within the scope of this project, in its own way the Centre stands as both a part of the original Connected Communities projects' legacy and as an exciting way to continue building legacy in the longer term.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0F447EF-0B89-4F2A-B6D9-380D8ACC2229</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>influence on methods for community engagement and co-researching with communities</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3FCB217E-CB3F-4B36-A141-56B793B42140</gtr:id><gtr:impact>increases in quality of life for marginalised groups such as Roma youths, unemployed and young people with disabilities
