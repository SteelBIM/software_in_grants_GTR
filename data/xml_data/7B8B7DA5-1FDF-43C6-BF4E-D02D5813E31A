This is of particular concern given the potential importance of such research both for debates about the retreat and/or re-emergence of religion in public life, and for testing assumptions about media ignorance, neglect and bias regarding religion.\n\nAddressing the programme theme of 'Religion, media and the arts', in this two-year project we will undertake a content analysis of current portrayals of popular religion and the secular sacred in a selection of British newspapers and terrestrial TV channels in order (a) to examine the ways in which the media currently represent religious issues, beliefs and practices, and (b) to uncover and interpret the values and interests inherent in these representations and the voices that constitute them. This quantitative and qualitative analysis will be complemented by two related studies, of people's reception and experience of religion in the media, and of the media treatment of a widely reported event involving religion. Replicating the research design and methods employed in an 18-month empirical research project undertaken in the 1980s at the University of Leeds, the new project will in part constitute a 're-study'. Such a longitudinal approach will enable a comparative analysis of the two datasets to be conducted, and changes in the representation of religion and its reception interpreted in light of theoretical debates about secularization, resacralization and the changing relationship of religion and secularity. The project will go further, however, by employing analytical and theoretical approaches which draw on the recent work of the applicants, and by delivering practical and engaged as well as scholarly outcomes. \n\nFollowing the earlier study, the project will focus on four questions:\n\n(1) How are religion - both conventional and common - and the secular sacred portrayed in selected newspapers and on terrestrial television channels? In what types of coverage is religion represented? What key themes emerge, and how are they treated?\n\n(2) What does the portrayal of these themes reveal about the relationship between (a) religion and the media, and (b) religion and secularity?\n\n(3) How are media portrayals of religion received and experienced by their audiences in light of their own religious/secular interests and everyday media practices?\n\n(4) How do findings from the new research compare with those from the earlier study, and how can changes regarding the representation of religion and the secular sacred be explained with reference to historical developments and sociological theories?\n\nThe research will be conducted by Kim Knott, researcher on the 1982 project who has worked recently on the location and representation of religion in various secular contexts, such as a school, medical centre, academic disciplines and urban landscapes; Elizabeth Poole, who has researched extensively on media representations of British Muslims; Robert Towler, the sociologist of religion who directed the 1982 project and until 2002 was Head of Research at the Independent Television Commission; an RA, Teemu Taira, with experience of researching religion in news media; and an Advisory Board of scholars and media practitioners.\n\nA co-authored monograph will be written drawing on material from both projects in the context of historical events and theoretical debates about the public re-emergence of religion and its relationship to secular worldview and context. In addition to two workshops, one for religion and media scholars, the other for journalists, religious correspondents and programme makers (in association with which a training pack will be developed), two information sessions will be held for community groups on how the media represent religion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231116</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Religion and Media for Issues Today</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0874FA57-A16C-47B7-BE7F-5E42600DE1D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Contributed materials to Issues Today (a resource for KS3) no. 57, on religion (for teachers, libraries, schools).

If you've felt that there's been increased discussion of religion in the British media in recent years, a new study shows that you're right. Coverage of popular religion, Christianity and public life, Islam and other religions and atheism and secularism has all gone up since the early 1980s. This is not restricted to news coverage, but is also evident in sports, entertainment and advertising; references to fate, angels, magic, ghosts, miracles, and fortune telling are common. The single largest growth has been in coverage of Islam and it is overwhelmingly negative: Islam is presented as 'a problem'. But coverage of Christianity is also high. Why should this be, when over this same period church attendance and orthodox Christian belief have declined? It seems that the stock of Christian symbols and stories continues to provide a means for expressing wonder and fear, moral outrage and disgust, for praising celebrities and high achievers, contemplating the unexplained, and coping with unaccountable horror and crisis. 



Professor Kim Knott led the research funded by the Religion and Society Programme that established these findings. She and her team conducted a replication of an investigation of media portrayals of religion first carried out in 1982-83. In 2008-09 she, Elisabeth Poole and Teemu Taira analysed a month's content from the same newspapers: The Sun, The Times and The Yorkshire Evening Post and seven days TV from the same channels: BBC 1, BBC 2 and ITV, using the same methods. In addition, they reflected the array of contemporary outputs by looking at The Guardian, The Daily Mail, Channel 4 and Sky News. They also ran focus groups with the public, and looked in detail at coverage of the banning of Dutch MP Geert Wilders in 2009 from entering the UK. An unexpected opportunity was also taken up to research media coverage of Pope Benedict's 2010 visit to the UK, as the first project had looked at Pope John Paul's 1982 visit. 



The team found that most references to Islam in the newspapers and on TV portray Muslims as extremists, terrorists and radicals. Other coverage, particularly in the tabloids, refers provocatively to the 'Islamification' of Britain, or shows Islam as problematic for social integration. The criminal and immoral behaviour of clergy often attracts media attention as well, and the liberal press frequently represent Christianity as anti-egalitarian and out-of-date on issues of gender and homosexuality. Newspapers and television attract audiences by focusing on conflict, deviance and, of course, celebrity. Freedom of speech, human rights, personal choice, and the belief that religion should be a private not public matter are just some of the secular - but nonetheless sacred - views discussed and often held by media professionals themselves. In sum, the growth of religious diversity has led to a rise in media references to all types of religion and belief. Religion is still reflected in the language of popular culture, and Christianity continues to be represented as part of national heritage and the British landscape. In a nation which is increasingly religiously-illiterate as a result of declining participation, the media are more important than ever for informing the public about religious matters.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E03DAF9C-FD18-4AE9-89D1-9CA631BC4774</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
