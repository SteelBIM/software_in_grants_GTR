Malaria is one of the world's most debilitating infectious diseases and Plasmodium is related to several other major parasites of humans and livestock, so a better understanding of it may help us to understand and control other human and animal diseases as well. The lack of effective vaccines against most of these parasites and the emergence of drug-resistant parasites mean that there is an urgent need for research leading to new treatment strategies for malaria and related diseases. 
 
Single-celled parasites can replicate very rapidly inside infected people or animals. One basic function that all rapidly-replicating cells must perform is the maintenance of their telomeres: the ends of the chromosomes that make up the cell's genome. Telomeres become slightly shorter every time a cell divides and will eventually become too short for survival if they are not regularly extended. Cancer cells, for example, usually develop a method for replenishing their telomeres that allows them to replicate endlessly and grow out of control, whereas most normal cells in an adult body cannot do this.

The malaria parasite, like any other single-celled organism, replenishes its telomeres every time it divides, giving it an infinite capacity for replication. However, Plasmodium is a rather unusual microbe and we know very little about the machinery that controls its telomeres. Our understanding of telomeres in human cells is quite good, but the machinery that maintains telomeres in malaria parasites does not resemble the machinery in human cells. This project therefore focuses on the maintenance of telomeres in the malaria parasite. A better understanding of this could point us in the direction of new drug targets, since disrupting the structure and maintenance of telomeres is often lethal.

To find this machinery will require a biological fishing expedition. The whole genome of the malaria parasite will be broken up into pieces and the telomeric DNA will be fished out along with the proteins bound to it. These will then be identified and the experiment will be followed up by knocking out some of these proteins in parasites grown in the lab, to test whether they actually do control telomeres. 

Overall, the study will give us a better understanding of the mechanisms that maintain the telomeres of these unusual parasites. It may inform new drug strategies to combat malaria and related parasitic diseases affecting both humans and animals. The outcomes of the research will be published in open-access scientific journals and presented at international conferences. They will be communicated to the general public via lay summaries on appropriate websites and via science-writing in magazines and/or online.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed work will identify and characterise novel telomere-associated proteins in the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This parasite (along with other apicomplexans of medical and veterinary importance: Toxoplasma, Cryptosporidium, Eimeria, Babesia and Theileria) belongs to an early-branching, highly-divergent lineage and few of the factors that cap, regulate and maintain its telomeres have been identified by homology with model organisms. Telomere maintenance is, however, a vital basic function, and may also represent a novel drug target. 

This project will use Proteomics of Isolated Chromatin Segments (PICh) to identify the protein complement of telomeric DNA from P. falciparum. The PICh technique, in which cross-linked protein-DNA complexes are isolated via a specific DNA probe before identifying the proteins by mass spectrometry, was recently very successful in identifying known and novel components of the human telomere-binding complex. 
After identifying the telomeric proteome in wildtype P. falciparum, telomeric proteins in sirtuin-knockout parasites will be identified for comparison. The two 'sirtuin' histone deacetylases play key roles in regulating expression of sub-telomeric virulence genes. I have shown that they also affect telomere length and genome stability, so these enzymes may be central components of a telomere-regulating complex.
Telomeric proteins of particular interest will be validated by immunofluorescence with fluorescence in situ hybridisation, to verify their specificity for the telomere. Genetic knockouts will then be generated and phenotyped for an initial characterisation of the roles of these proteins: telomere length and telomere stability in knockout lines will be analysed by Southern blotting and karyotyping.

The project will improve our understanding of a fundamental aspect of Plasmodium biology, as well as opening up new avenues for research on Plasmodium and other important apicomplexan parasites.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Most research on infectious pathogens ultimately aims to inform or develop new therapeutics or control strategies, and thus to benefit affected communities. The project proposed here is no exception, since apicomplexan parasites have a severe impact on both human and animal health within the UK and across the world. In the case of malaria, caused by Plasmodium, the affected communities include human populations in the tropics and sub-tropics (almost 250 million cases of disease and 1 million deaths per year) as well as travellers, from tourists to military personnel, who visit malaria-endemic regions. The burden of disease and the socio-economic impact are clearly huge and there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the parasite to inform new control strategies. Besides Plasmodium, the related parasites Toxoplasma and Cryptosporidium cause significant human disease in immuno-compromised individuals, while Babesia, Theileria and Eimeria are major parasites of cattle and poultry.

Basic biological studies, leading through to applied research, have the potential to reveal new drug targets for these pathogens. Telomere-associated proteins represent a particularly promising target because a rapidly-replicating protozoan parasite must maintain its telomeres to survive, and the proposed project aims to identify exactly such targets. Newly discovered proteins usually take some years to translate to the clinic as drug targets, but there are many examples of basic research generating targets that soon move into drug screening studies. New drugs to combat apicomplexan parasites could ultimately benefit diverse groups of people in the UK and the wider world, including residents of malaria-endemic countries, travellers, military personnel and those in the agricultural industry. 

The impact of this project will extend beyond the long-term possibility of discovering new anti-parasitic drugs. Supporting more malaria researchers will expand the community working on this important disease, thus raising awareness and facilitating more research funding. My continuing career as a parasite biologist depends upon early-career grants such as this one and I hope that my career will ultimately include both basic research and field studies, as my postdoctoral work did. Field studies can bring many particular benefits to the communities affected by the malaria parasite - by bringing people into contact with educated researchers as well as by providing employment and direct scientific education. For example, while working in the Gambia, I had many conversations with Gambian citizens on public transport about the importance of completing courses of malaria treatment, treating young children promptly before severe disease develops and using bednets, amongst other issues. The value of such contact in educating local communities and raising the profile of UK-funded researchers should not be underestimated. 

Turning to impacts within the UK, my career will include undergraduate and postgraduate teaching as well as research, and it is particularly incumbent upon scientists studying neglected and tropical parasites to raise their profile and enthuse students about working on important public health topics that can remain 'invisible' in the developed world. I hope to inspire a new generation of students to consider careers in biological research, in international development, or in human or veterinary medicine - all of which will benefit both the students themselves and the communities affected by parasitic diseases. 

Finally, I am employed at Keele University in North Staffordshire, an area of high unemployment that was recently designated by the government for a Local Enterprise Partnership to promote economic redevelopment. The proposed project will immediately bring skilled academic work to a region with few such opportunities in which the university is a significant and valuable employer.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>357233</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lohengrin (Institut Laue-Langevin)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>Protein structural studies on PfTRF1</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FA0BBF7-71F7-4CDF-BF7B-46CCE65F9F97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Expression and purification methodology for PfTRF1 is under development.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The lab of Prof Trevor Forsyth provided large-scale expression facilities and will provide access to crystalisation screening</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research concept, protein expression constructs and preliminary work were provided by my team.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Hospital of Montpellier</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>France, French Republic</gtr:country><gtr:description>DNA combing, Montpellier University</gtr:description><gtr:id>D1D1C965-6E73-449B-A64B-379F37166060</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Preliminary data in support of two major grant applications currently under assessment (BBSRC and ERC).</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The collaborators provide access to the DNA combing facility, and data analysis skills for the resultant DNA fibre images.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I conducted method-development in preparing Plasmodium for DNA combing, and provided parasite material to collaborators in Montpellier.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Hospitals</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BSP YouTube channel</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6DB505D2-31DC-499D-B6C2-748FDE010EA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Catherine Merrick became Hon.

Considerable efforts were made to develop the PiCh methodology for Plasmodium parasites, to indentify novel telomere-binding proteins agnostically. Many technical hurdles were encountered (low and non-specific sample yields; contaminating erythrocyte and other proteins in the MS results, insufficient sensitivity in MS instrumentation available at Keele; building work at Keele that put the MS lab out of action for long periods, etc.) and these were in general overcome. During the project, a competitor lab informed us of similar problems they had encountered in developing PiCh for Plasmodium. The final round of PiCh samples, produced shortly before the grant ended, is still awaiting Mass Spectrometry with a new collaborative partner at Liverpool University. If good results are obtained, both the methods-development work and the results will be written up for publication within 2017.

Alongside the PiCh work, a large amount of molecular-genetic work was conducted on the telomere-binding candidate protein PfTRF1. This target proved refractory to many modes of genetic intervention but the results from this work have nonetheless been written up into a paper for submission within 2017 ('Plasmodium falciparum 'TRF1': an essential protein expressed primarily in gametocytes', Edwards-Smallbone &amp;amp; Merrick). 

Finally, a side project developed alongside this work, by the PI Dr Merrick, to monitor DNA replication in Plasmodium parasites, was very successful. It resulted in preliminary data contributing to two successful awards of MRC and ERC grants within 2016, and two publications thus far (Merrick, Malar J. 2015 and Stanojcic et al., under review at Scientific Reports 2017).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The PiCh method, if ultimately successful for telomeres, may be applicable to other regions in the Plasmodium genome.

However, this was not previously possible in Plasmodium - despite conflicting reports in the literature going back 25 years - because the parasite relies only on de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and does not salvage thymidine analogues like BrdU for conversion into nucleotides. I have recently showed that expressing a TK enzyme in transgenic parasites supplies the pyrimidine salvage pathway and allow parasites to be labelled with BrdU (see paper by Merrick, Malar J. 2015). Therefore, this can now be exploited to investigate how DNA replication is organised, from the whole-cell to the single-molecule level, during both schizogony and gametogenesis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B74C2957-C6C1-48C1-AA78-157CD522DF7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I am actively exploiting this method to study replication dynamics in Plasmodium.
