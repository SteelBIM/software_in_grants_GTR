In the UK and elsewhere in Europe, there is a renewed policy emphasis and concern about the role of men in families. At the same time, there is no single comprehensive source of information about men as fathers, their contribution and role in the family, involvement in childrearing, economic activity and contribution and how these factors interact.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to bridge this information gap and establish the UK's foremost analysis about the lives of fathers using data from four large-scale survey series: the Understanding Society, the European Union Labour Force Survey, the European Social Survey and the British Household Panel Study. Although principally focused on fathers in the UK, this study will also include international data to enhance our understanding of the role that societal-level factors play in shaping fathers' work and family life.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will inform the development of innovative work-care policies and practices and empower key stakeholders to carry out their work more effectively drawing on the improved understanding of men's diverse family and work roles.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This study has received ethical approval from NatCen Social Research and UEA.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Existing literature and scoping research demonstrates a clear need for comprehensive and accessible data on fathers, that those working across the areas of family policy, employment rights and work-life balance can refer to and rely on. A number of organisations who would benefit from this research and the specific ways in which they might use the data have been identified:

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS)
BIS has expressed interest in the research and strongly supports this application, as can be seen in the attached letter of support. One of BIS' core policy areas is the labour market and within that, flexible and family-friendly employment practices. BIS has identified that there are currently gaps in the evidence base on the impact of family-friendly policies and has stated that it expects this study to contribute to filling these gaps and to inform the development of family friendly policies in the UK.

NGOs and charities 
Through our scoping work it is clear that various NGOs and charities would find real value in the outputs of this research. The Fatherhood Institute has stated that &amp;quot;this project will make a real difference to improving the evidence base for national policy and practice interventions with fathers, families and employers across the country&amp;quot; (see attached letter of support). They have identified this research as being directly relevant to the issues around fathers' lives that they are trying to address. The single parent charity Gingerbread has stated that its own in-house research highlighted a lack of information on single-fathers (see attached letter of support). Given that they rely on robust and thoughtful data analysis to inform their services, they have stated that the proposed research is highly valuable and would be directly useful to their work and the services they provide. 

Preliminary discussions with other NGOs and charities have demonstrated that the proposed research would be valuable to the work of organisations in a range of different areas and with different policy focuses including: work-life balance, relationships, employment and gender equality. The work-life balance charity Working Families stated the proposed research is highly relevant to its work on policy and employment especially given that its own research has highlighted that (in comparison to research on mothers) there is relatively little research on fathers and their experience of work-life balance. Furthermore, the Fawcett Society, the relationship support charity Relate, representatives from the Diversity in Business Council of Conference Board and from the Trade Union Congress (see attached support statement) have all given their support to the application and have stated that the research would be of real use and interest to them. 

Other beneficiaries
In addition to those we have been in contact with, there are a number of others who may benefit from the data and outputs produced from this research. The detailed profiling data on fathers has the potential to benefit user organisations and political institutions (e.g. House of Commons All Party Group on Fathers) working with specific subgroups of fathers (e.g. BME fathers, young fathers, fathers living in disadvantage, fathers of a particular religion) since the current data on these subgroups are so poor. This new data has the potential to enable organisations working in this area to understand better the specific challenges, work patterns and models of family life experienced by fathers in the subgroups they work with and how these compare to fathers in the wider population. 

Advisory Group
As detailed in the Pathways to Impact attachment, we have commitment from BIS and a number of charities and organisations to sit on an Advisory Group for this project. The Advisory Group will be utilised to ensure that the outputs from the study are relevant and can be used in a way which will ensure impact on policy and practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-21</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-22</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>154596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Modern Fatherhood website 
We have developed a website www.modernfatherhood.org, where we publish policy briefing papers from the project, slides from conference presentations, blogs from stakeholders and press releases. Visitors to the website are invited to leave comments. The website has been 'live' since July 2013 and we are continuing to add materials to it (e.g. a set of four new briefing papers added in 2016). Since its launch, the website has had over 27,000 users and over 74,000 page views. It was referenced in a recent Observer editorial (https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/fathers-help-create-happy-families-but-the-state-neglects-their-role). 

Policy
During the period of our award, 2012-14, we organised two dissemination events and delivered three briefing sessions for policy makers (DWP, May 2014, BIS July 2014 and the Cross-Government Family Analysis group, September 2014). In advance of each briefing, we liaised with our Advisory Group member from the government department to agree content which would be most useful to their work. For DWP we presented on non-resident fathers; parental employment for BIS and fathers' work in Europe for the Cross Government Family Analysis Group, Our main dissemination event, in July 2014, chaired by Rt Hon Charles Clarke, attracted around 70 people, and enabled cross-sector dialogue about the challenges of active fatherhood. All received very positive feedback from stakeholders telling us how useful the evidence was to them in their work, including:

1)Adrienne Burgess, Co-CEO of the Fatherhood Institute: &amp;quot;I am currently using your research in the report I am writing for Nuffield [Foundation], and have used information from it when briefing at least half a dozen journalists. I have also referred journalists directly to the website. It's invaluable - the most up to date material we have, and brilliantly analysed and presented&amp;quot;. 
2)Christopher Muwanguzi, dad.info/Family Matters Institute: &amp;quot;We used the research findings to inform some of the changes we made with dad.info. The findings were combined along with our own research to give us better insight of how to make sure the site appealed to men and fathers. Our site was previously focused on crisis and dealing with problems, but now has more content to engage men and fathers on the journey rather than a point of crisis in the journey. This in turn has allowed us to be more preventative in our approach and has already demonstrated an increase in reach. Family Matters Institute also delivers training to practitioners working with families, on a number of our courses we have integrated the research to give family practitioners a better understanding of Fathers and their relationships with their families and Work. The Evidence base adds quality to our courses, and also gives practitioners a better understanding of how they should engage with men in their parenting role.&amp;quot; 
3)Jon Rallings, Barnardos: &amp;quot;I can cite two instances of where I have used your stats. One was the presentation I made to the APPG for Parenthood around Jan/Feb [2015] time. The other was in a press release we put out on Fathers day around the hardships fathers are facing in which we used some figures from the study to calculate the number of young dads (18-21) who might potentially be affected by the changes to housing benefit. You are the only source of data really.&amp;quot; 

As part of the UN International Year of the Family 2014 our evidence was profiled through Prof O'Brien's involvement as an expert at the conference Empowering Families (April 2014, Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development) building on her contribution to the first UN report on male roles Men in Families and Family Policy in a Changing World in 2011. She was influential in keeping the pressure to ensure that men were embedded in two of the ten actions of the subsequent &amp;quot;Doha Call to Action&amp;quot; issued internationally but targeted at Arab policy makers, traditionally female focused, including &amp;quot;Recognize the contribution and responsibility of men to families, develop policies to address the impact of the absence of males/fathers on family wellbeing and promote active fatherhood. &amp;quot; Family Futures UN 20th Twentieth Anniversary. http://digital.tudor-rose.co.uk/family-futures/ .

More recently OECD's analysts have noted the influence of the project's evidence in understanding &amp;quot;the diversifying patterns of families across the OECD&amp;quot; (Thevenon, 2016) and EU Commissioner Vera Jourova invited O'Brien to provide evidence on incentivizing fathers to take leave at the Round Table meeting &amp;quot;New start for working parents&amp;quot; (Brussels, February 2016). 

In the UK our evidence informed the Scottish Parliament Equal Opportunities Committee on fathers and parenting: http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_EqualOpportuntiesCommittee/General Documents/20_March_papers.pdf. The Fathers and Parenting Report published by EOC May 2016, based upon the evidence considered in these meetings http://www.parliament.scot/S4_EqualOpportunitiesCommittee/Reports/eor-14-01w.pdf. O'Brien's earlier keynote at the Scottish Year of the Dad conference, in February attended by 181 people, helped frame policy, particularly through her collaboration with Fathers Network Scotland, the local mover and shaker NGO. http://www.fathersnetwork.org.uk/research_conferen ce_who_loves_you_daddy.

Our work was cited in 'Young Dads: overlooked, undercounted, but out there' a report by Rt Hon. David Lammy MP, published by 4Children, which draws attention to young fathers, collates statistics about them and suggest how services available to young fathers could be improved forming part of a response to the DWP's Family Stability review in 2014. (http://www.4children.org.uk/Resources/Detail/DavidLammy-essay-Young-Dads). In February 2017, we submitted evidence to the House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee inquiry on Fathers in the Workplace.

Throughout our work has been linked on websites as a useful resource for user groups and lobbyists for marginalized fathers in society e.g. the KnowledgeBank a website of key resources curated by OnePlusOne with input from Relate, Marriage Care and the Tavistock Centre for Couple Relationships (http://knowledgebank.oneplusone.org.uk/page/12. The Fatherhood Institute used our evidence in their campaign highlighting that children of non-residential fathers may be disadvantaged by the &amp;quot;bedroom tax&amp;quot;. 

We have sought to engage with the media from the Daily Mail to the FT and specialist websites such as Conversation and Society Central and as a result our research findings have had lots of media coverage.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1CD2714B-A4CE-45F8-A31A-502788052D80</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings from the project are outlined in correspondence to the four key objectives outlined in the research proposal.

Aim 1: 
We have produced a comprehensive profiling of fathers in 21st Century UK, using data from the Understanding Society, wave 1 (2010-11), EU-Labour Force Survey (2001-2011) and the European Social Survey (2004 and 2010). This profiling has focused on vital statistics about fathers in the UK (including those with resident and non-resident children), as well as an analysis of fathers' working hours, families' employment patterns, father involvement with children, their relationships with partners, and their experiences of work-family conflict. 

Our novel 'father-centric' analysis of non-residential fatherhood has enabled us to outline four different 'types' of non-resident fathers, which could be a useful analytical tool. These are 'Engaged' fathers, 'Less Engaged' fathers, 'Disengaged' fathers and 'Distance' fathers.

Aim 2: 
We have explored factors associated with fathers' work patterns and family life. The most significant achievements have been in the area of fathers' employment patterns and in the area of non-residential fatherhood.

We identified a growth in dual full-time earner households, increasing hours of work of mothers in traditional 1.5 earner parent couple households and a growing proportion of households with non-standard patterns, which suggests both a convergence in economic provisioning within parent couple households and increased diversity, particularly in the post economic crisis period. 

We investigated which factors are associated with paternal involvement in family and found that the quality of the couple relationship is linked with how involved the father is with the child. Understanding that the couple relationship is important not only for the parents themselves but also for child involvement is useful to relationship practitioners and also potentially policy makers.

Aim 3: 
UK coupled fathers working full-time had the highest average working hours across EU in 2001, and second highest (behind Greece) in 2011. Our evidence shows that between 2001-2011 UK fathers' average weekly work hours have declined; shift work and working at weekends and night has declined and part-time working has increased.

We also investigated how the 2008 recession has affected UK fathers' experience of underemployment (wanting to work longer hours than those currently worked) and found that coupled fathers experienced less underemployment than men in other circumstances.

Aim 4: 
We compared UK fathers with those in seven other purposively-selected EU countries.

We found that the sole male breadwinner is in retreat, maternal employment is rising, and those countries hit hardest by the recession have seen an increase in atypical working practices (Spain and Greece have seen a tripling of sole female breadwinners).

We found that UK fathers reported levels of work-family conflict which were consistently the highest among the countries in the study (with the exception of Greece post-economic crisis), while fathers in the Netherlands reported consistently the lowest levels. This highlighted the importance of labour market structures, such as the strength of labour rights and the norms and practices around the length of the working week.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has been very successful in engaging a diverse group of academic researchers, policy makers, politicians and practitioners with the findings of the study.

Academic impact:
Our project website (www.modernfatherhood.org) contains briefing papers, comprehensive statistics, presentations, and blogs from stakeholders. It has had over 27,000 users and over 74,000 page views. We continue to add materials to the website and have recently secured additional funding to update its layout.

We presented findings at national and international conferences. Two journal papers have already been published (the Journal of Social Policy and the Work, Employment and Society), one is under review with the European Sociological Review and two are being prepared. 

New insights into the definition and measurement of fatherhood are embedded in the findings. We achieved a balance between a simple reductive approach (e.g. 'fathers' and 'non-fathers') and an overly elaborated set reliant on too many dimensions. The resulting four-fold typology contributes to concept-driven analysis of men's economic and family behavior in large-scale data sets.

Non-academic impact:
We organised two dissemination events and delivered three briefing sessions for policy makers (DWP, BIS and Cross-Government Family Analysis Group) and received very positive feedback. Study findings informed &amp;quot;Fathers and work-family policy&amp;quot; section of Family Futures Digital Book commemorating the UN twentieth anniversary of the International Year of the Family. We engaged throughout the project with the Fatherhood Institute who publicised our findings and used them to campaign against the &amp;quot;bedroom tax&amp;quot;. We worked with other members of our Advisory Group including policy makers, NGOs, journalists and academics. Our findings were widely reported in the media and on specialised websites such as Conversation and Society Central (see e.g. the recent Observer Editorial (https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2017/feb/12/fathers-help-create-happy-families-but-the-state-neglects-their-role). We are preparing a round table for summer 2017, which will draw on research findings from the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8A83A7B7-ADC6-4B9A-8749-DE8052B90171</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.modernfatherhood.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in David Lammy's report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BEE4C131-2D76-4CAE-8F81-350725768FAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This report by Rt Hon.
