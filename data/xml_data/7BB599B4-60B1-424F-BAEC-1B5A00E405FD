The resulting technology will address the barriers that prevent more effective use of modelling and simulation in designing newbuilt factories and managing the operations of existing factories. The research results will be demonstrated by integrating Lanner's DES tool WITNESS with Oculus Rift, a VR goggle, and Microsoft Kinect, an integrated 3D sensing device, hence incorporating immersive VR (Immersive WITNESSS or IW) and live event feedback capabilities (Live WITNESS or LW) into WITNESS.
What is Immersive WITNESS (IW)? IW is the integration of the latest consumer device VR technology (Oculus Rift) with Lanner's DES tool WITNESS. At the moment, WITNESS mainly relies on standard (non-immersive) display technologies.
VR was a very popular topic in the 1990s, but interest waned away rapidly due to a gap between expectations and technological limitations. Recent developments have closed the gap considerably, opening up an opportunity for a fresh attempt to achieve the full potential of VR in manufacturing simulations.
How does IW bring value? The coupling of DES and VR opens up a new dimension for process simulation. Among the benefits cited in literature are increased involvement from decision makers resulting in an improved model and better understanding of the processes, increased confidence in the model, quicker and easier detection of errors and evaluation of model behaviour, facilitation of the generation of ideas, and better communication with clients and other stakeholders.
Oculus provides unprecedented immersion in a VR world at a fraction of the cost of traditional devices. Furthermore, new developments in human-computer interfaces (Leap Motion, Sixense STEM, Myo, Kinect) have opened up potentially useful
ways for users to interact with the virtual world.
What is Live WITNESS (LW)? LW is a novel means to synchronise DES simulation with real-world through the use of an integrated 3D-sensing consumer device (Microsoft Kinect) that can provide a cheap, robust and unobtrusive sensor system on the shop-floor to view a given scene, observe a process and generate appropriate signals to update the DES model.
How does LW bring value? The drawback of using DES is the effort and cost of processing the input data from various data sources to ensure valid simulation results. Attempts have been made for gathering data from existing ICT systems; dealing
with legacy data remains a great challenge. LW side-steps this problem by using a cheaply generated data stream. Success will mean that DES models can accurately represent real-world processes at all times.
Why are IW and LW being proposed together to create Immersive/Live WITNESS (I/LW)? 3D sensing and VR are complementary technologies; the former helps in constructing an accurate virtual mirror of the real world and the latter
visualises the resulting virtual world. For example, Kinect provides a way to rapidly generate virtual world that mirrors reality, which can be viewed and edited using Oculus. This project provides a setting where both technologies can complement each other. The proposed approach of developing IW and LW at the same time will also reduce risks whilst creating more value than if each component were developed separately. Cranfield University will lead the integrated development of I/LW.
Choice of technologies: There have been many recent developments in human-computer interface technologies rooted in
consumer devices, such as Oculus Rift and Microsoft Kinect. In manufacturing, these technologies have the potential to deliver an unprecedented level of immersiveness, detail and real-time accuracy to DES such that the virtual factory always
accurately mirrors the real factory. This is a new project with no direct competitors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economic benefits for the consortium: The main beneficiaries of this project are the consortium members. The research
aims to integrate Discrete Event Simulation (DES) with recent innovations in gaming interface technologies to incorporate
novel immersive Virtual Reality (VR) and live event feedback capabilities into DES. The resulting technology will address
the barriers that prevent more effective use of modelling and simulation in designing new-built factories and managing the
operations of existing factories. The research results will be demonstrated by integrating Lanner's DES tool WITNESS with
Oculus Rift, a VR goggle, and Microsoft Kinect, an integrated 3D sensing device, hence incorporating immersive VR
(Immersive WITNESSS or IW) and live event feedback capabilities (Live WITNESS or LW) into WITNESS. The main
deliverables (IW, LW and integrated I/LW) will be commercialised by the consortium as add-on modules to WITNESS.
These deliverables will create direct economic benefits for all consortium partners through a revenue sharing agreement.
Three exploitation paths are envisioned: (i) The integrated I/LW will initially be licensed to large manufacturers as a standard package catering to the design and operations of factories. (ii) Each component (IW and LW) can also be licensed
to customers as standard packages, and as customised packages for specialised needs. (iii) Exploitation may also happen
through Alstom, which could adopt the deliverables within the company, towards deployment as a business wide system in
addition to the design of factory layouts.
Economic benefits for the UK and the EEA: This project will benefit the manufacturing and ICT companies in the UK,
particularly the manufacturers who use modelling and simulation in designing new-built factories and managing the
operations of existing factories, &amp;quot;manufacturers' manufacturers&amp;quot; who design and implement manufacturing systems,
designers and developers of machine tools and industrial robots, and ICT providers involved in the simulation and
optimisation of manufacturing systems, gaming technologies and immersive virtual environments. For manufacturing
companies, this project has the potential to deliver an unprecedented level of immersiveness, detail and real-time accuracy
to DES simulation such that the virtual factory always accurately mirrors the real factory. This will allow an engineering
team to reconstruct a shop-floor into a VR world, then walk through the 3D model that is updated live from the shop-floor,
make exploratory changes in the VR world directly, and verify and validate outcomes in VR. This project will provide the
ICT companies with a novel approach to integrate DES tools with state-of-the-art VR and 3D sensing technologies. The
EEA will benefit because Alstom and other manufacturing companies will remain competitive and continue to support their
partners/vendors in the EEA. The proposed technology will be useful for any manufacturing company that uses modelling
and simulation in designing new-built factories and managing the operations of existing factories, such as energy
equipment, train, automotive and aerospace manufacturers.
Environmental and social benefits: This project will have environmental and social benefits through right-first-time building
of factories and through more efficient factories in terms of energy and material usage. Reducing factory test runs and the
time needed for production ramp-up will reduce consumption of resources. By ensuring that factory layout modelling
incorporates live data about human movement, there will also be improvements in health and safety and workers' quality of life.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>330365</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This video shows the end-to-end system demonstrator of project results.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4AA7D1D1-E81C-4F63-A647-05ECE290C9D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This video has been shown to potential partners and collaborators with good feedback, resulting in multiple follow-on project opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Video of final demonstrator</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8U6u9N1nsqM</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Global Robots</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Investigating the use of smart objects and robots for intelligent manufacturing</gtr:description><gtr:id>57382CDE-F491-417B-9798-651A5E80045C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One Innovate UK proposal with another being prepared</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Global Robots will be providing refurbished robots for demonstrators while GE Garages will investigate how the demonstrator could be used to develop their new line of products.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Cranfield Team are working with Global Robots and General Electric (GE) Garages to develop an innovate UK proposal to investigate the possibility of &amp;quot;smartening up&amp;quot; objects on the manufacturing line.

Developing Machine Learning Techniques to Mine Sensor Data: This project started with the recognition of the potential of sensor data feeds for better decisions in smart manufacturing. Towards this, mining of sensor data feeds is achieved using machine learning techniques. These techniques utilise previously generated simulation models and CAD models to train computer vision algorithms. The trained computer vision algorithms are capable of: (1) inferring the status of machines as well as material flows in a factory, (2) inferring the status of manual assembly tasks, and (3) updating simulation models. The updated models enable better prediction of future manufacturing states, for example, whether a manufacturing target will be achieved at the current production rate. Going forward, we envisage that these project outputs will be taken up by companies and fed into their smart manufacturing initiatives. 

Exploiting Virtual Reality Technologies for Zero Prototyping of Factory Layouts: We have developed techniques that enable users to simulate material and people flows on a shop floor. We can update the status of machines in the virtual reality environment and see the effect of the changes on production rates and targets. This helps decision makers experiment with various factory configurations without the need to disrupt a manufacturing line. We envisage that these outputs will be eventually assimilated into simulation products in the near future. The users of these products will have an option to use virtual reality immersion to show all potential stakeholders how a future planned factory will operate. These outputs have enabled the project partner, Lanner Group, to showcase futuristic capabilities that are within reach at conferences and user events. The tangible demonstrators developed by the project have enabled the project partner, GE Power, to connect with other teams across the wider GE organisation and inform a number of future applications within the business.

Societal Impact: The project team was also active in engaging with other audiences. On 22 March 2016, students from Holywell Middle School visited the Manufacturing Informatics Centre at Cranfield University. Eighteen students accompanied by three staff members were met by Professor Ashutosh Tiwari and his team. Selected project outputs, such as the use of Microsoft Kinect sensors on manufacturing shop floors to help factories improve their productivity, were showcased to the students. We believe that this public engagement exercise has enabled the team to inspire the next generation of students to take up manufacturing. 

Future: This project will have environmental and social benefits through right-first-time building of factories and through more efficient factories in terms of energy and material usage. Reducing factory test runs and the time needed for production ramp-up will reduce consumption of resources. For example, an ongoing work with the Manufacturing Technology Centre is looking at how Virtual Reality could be used to develop digital twins of a physical robot cell towards exploring human-robot collaboration strategies. The hypothesis is that the lessons learnt in a virtual environment will inform policies on safe human-robot collaboration.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E91B13E2-60E1-46F9-9F23-229C6C5ECBF2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have discovered that it is possible and valuable to develop convincing factory environments through the use of consumer-grade Virtual Reality. In this virtual environment, we can experiment with various factory layout possibilities and see which ones work best for a given scenario. As the virtual environment is linked with manufacturing simulation, we can also &amp;quot;run&amp;quot; the factory through various scenarios. For example, we can stop individual machines to see how this affects overall production. We can also experiment with various ways of addressing shop floor issues, thereby reducing the risk in actual implementation. Through simulation, we can discover layout and operational issues before any money is spent on building the actual factory. This translates into cost and time effectiveness.

We have also discovered that it is possible and valuable to feed data back into the manufacturing process simulation from the actual shop floor using consumer-grade sensors. One key contribution within this is our discovery of a way to train a computer equipped with a camera to recognise what it is looking at on a manufacturing floor. Training was achieved through the use of pre-defined simulation models and a database of shop floor CAD geometries. This enables the computer to infer manual handling tasks as well as the status of machines on the shop floor. From this, performance data of the actual process can be recorded. Comparison of this data with simulated data enables us to highlight potential bottlenecks and production shortfalls. 

Finally, by combining the virtual factory environment with live data feedback, we have developed a way to create a &amp;quot;digital twin&amp;quot; that can be used by factory managers to increase productivity while significantly de-risking the impact of factory layout changes.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Connecting Virtual Reality (VR) and Process Simulation (PS) in a hybrid framework is a powerful combination that is currently under-researched. We have shown that VR gives users the power to experience a factory before it is constructed while PS enables users to conduct predictive simulations to analyse the effects of various decisions on the factory. Other researchers can take forward our framework by combining VR with different types of PS, such as Agent-Based Simulation or System Dynamics Simulation. Our research on bootstrapping vision systems using process models can have great value in many industrial applications, for example, it can be used to upgrade the connectivity of legacy machines in a factory. In addition, our work on predictive simulation fed by real-time shop floor data can be expanded further by utilising the latest advances in machine learning technique, e.g. deep learning. Finally, these findings could be applied to a range of industrial sectors, such as power, automotive, aerospace, construction and healthcare management.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9C0FF46C-3037-46B7-AB70-15E42331FC85</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a workflow that uses a set of software tools that use CAD models and shop floor measurements to convert physical spaces into virtual spaces.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E098A443-C106-4C09-B377-CBB42092DD45</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The approach is currently being investigated to keep track of maintenance updates in manufacturing plants.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Virtual Reality work flow for developing manufacturing digital twins</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This method uses a camera system to read and infer the state of a manufacturing shop floor.
