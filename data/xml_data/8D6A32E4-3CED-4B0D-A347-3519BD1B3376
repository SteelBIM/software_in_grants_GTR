Exchange</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J005150/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This unique consortium draws on the research excellence of interdisciplinary and complementary design innovation labs at three universities - Lancaster University, Newcastle University and the Royal College of Art and connects it with public and private sectors, linking large and small-scale businesses, service providers and citizens. Together, our expertise in developing and applying creative techniques to navigate unexplored challenges includes that of designers, artists, curators, producers, broadcasters, engineers, managers, technologists and writers - and draws on wider expertise from across the partner universities and beyond.

The Creative Exchange responds to profound changes in practice in the creative and media-based industries stimulated by the opening of the digital public space, the ability of everyone to access, explore and create in any aspect of the digital space, moving from 'content consumption' to 'content experience'. It explores new forms of engagement and exchange in the broadcast, performing and visual arts, digital media, design and gaming sectors, by focusing on citizen-led content, interactive narrative, radical personalization and new forms of value creation in the context of the 'experience economy'. The primary geographic focus is the Northwest of England centred around the opportunity presented by the growth of MediaCityUK and its surrounding economy. The three universities act as local test beds with field trials in London, Lancaster and Newcastle prior to larger public facing trials in the northwest. This will support the North West regional strategy for growth in digital and creative media industries, whilst generating comparative research and development locally, nationally and internationally.

The Creative Exchange has been developed in response to a paradigm shift in content creation and modes of distribution in a digitally connected world, which has profound impact for the arts and humanities. This transformational-change is taking place within the landscape of a growing digital public space that includes archives, data, information and content. How we navigate and experience this space - and how we generate content for and within it - is central to how we create economic, social, cultural and personal value. The Hub draws on new and agile approaches to knowledge exchange for the creative economy that have been previously developed by the partner universities and new ones co-developed with specialist arts organizations, sector organizations and communities of users.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This hubs will explore new forms of engagement and exchange in the broadcast, performing &amp;amp; visual arts, digital media, design and gaming sectors. Many of whom will be located in the Northwest of England around the opportunity presented by the growth of Media City and it surrounding economy. However as the three universities will act as local test beds prior to public facing trials in the northwest and therefore beneficiary companies will also be located in NorthEast and London.

Through literature, individual company engagement and our pre-bid workshop in Manchester we have identified wide ranging business/organisational research and skills needs, ranging from:
1 Understanding citizen empowerment, how to operate in an experience economy, how to upskill for the digital environment especially in Northwest and MediaCity (NWDA (2008),Skills Set(2010) 
2 Understanding 'how an avalanche of technology will deliver opportunities as well as threats' 'to explore how to avoid inequality of access' 'Arts understanding of the audience and how to create experiences using technology', 'how to increase citizen engagement both physically and digitally' 'how to understand human responses, psychology and legal and ethical issues' Sample from Workshop 25 June.
3 Exploring the opportunities presented by the digital public space, and to explore access issues, enable business to experiment, to prototype experiences in the real world, understand the creative context for data driven experiences, broker new forms of co-design develop new services that go beyond crowd sources, (partners) 
 
Therefore a wide range of partners have been recruited to develop the Hub. These include a Lead partner, BBC. Large corporates (e.g Miscrosoft) Public Sector (e.g. Manchester City Council, Lancashire City Council); connecting/portal bodies (e.g Sharp, Creative Lancashire); and SME's Creative Concern, Stardotstar.
The Creative Exchange Hub's proposed knowledge exchange activities responds to these needs and impacts on the target sectors through:
i) Identifying shared concerns, skills needs and emerging trends and themes of interest and concern to partner companies through the curate activity 
ii) Brokering connections between organisations and businesses to identify project, research requirements and KE and facilitating exchange of leading edge academic research, sharing insights and trends through the connect activity
iii) Facilitating new collaborations around new services and products generated through co-creation and design experiments, enabling scaling-up of micro-enterprises and SMEs and opening up new demonstration and live testing opportunities, and thus enable new entrepreneurial activities around new services and products, through the intervention activity
iv) Introducing new knowledge and access to new arts and humanities researchers during the resource activity
v) Enabling citizen and community engagement via participation in events, co-design, rapid prototyping and testing, investigating appropriate, usable, personal and meaningful services that lead to new business proposition, through field trials.
iv)Developing toolkits for creative KE mechanisms for exploitation beyond the hub and into other sectors such as health and transport, and other disciplines e.g Law or Philosophy
v) Disseminating to a broader industry audience through industry facing conferences both the KE activities and mechanisms

The KE Hub will identify and attract additional partners into the the Hub through an energetic communication campaign, through the hub council and partners support and communication of successful activities, dissemination of the work through the conferences and field trials, and through the allied activities of the Highwire CDT, SIDE Digital Hub and RCA Helen Hamlyn Centre and our intermediary partners such as Sharp and Creative Lancashire. All of which enables us to expand the hub, its impact and its sustainability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4042323</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Music video by Cape Town hip hop artist</gtr:description><gtr:id>C39C8C4A-9B0D-4804-A0F9-59406BDE2270</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 5,000 YouTube views across the 5 videos</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Cinehack Music Video - Sterk op Hede by Die Skerpste Lem</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.cinehack.com/cinehack-cape-town/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Tuning In - Listening Back in Time is a reconstruction of time distant voices and personal accounts of events on Tyneside during the First World War.

The suitcases support face-to-face and mediated encounters and the valorization of existing relations within a locality. The design of the suitcases emphasise choice and reciprocity through a process of 'asking' and 'giving', formulating questions to inspire story telling and nominating people to hand a suitcase to. With their thoughtful material design, travelling suitcases are specifically designed to draw people in reflective processes and engage with fellow citizens' personal narratives and perspectives.

The suitcases technical system was chosen to make the system as accessible as possible-tailored for low media and digital literacy skills, and to upload media content online in areas where there is very low or inexistent wi-fi network and accessibility. For this reason an Interactive Voice Responsive system was chosen. The suitcase comprised a GSM phone in a 3D printed case, which allowed the recoding and uploading of media content online without the need for an internet connection. Suitcase comes with its associated webpage where all content can be accessed (and curate it). 

Process 
A 'Travelling Suitcase' is given to a citizen who is prompted to record a story s/he wants to share with others. Then the citizen is invited to pick an envelope and write something about the story recorded and added it to the top of the suitcase. S/he is then prompted to choose someone else to hand the suitcase to and formulate a question to inspire storytelling. In this way the suitcase travels person to person till the last envelope that prompts to handing the suitcase back to the initiator of the process.

Technical system 
For the purpose of building a robust, sustainable (in terms of monetary costs and technical expertise needed to use and maintain it) and reliable system for the collection of place-related stories and their community dissemination an IVR system was designed and developed. A number of communications frameworks have been reviewed for this (including asterisk and freeswitch) but for the purpose of this project a more reliable and quick solution was chosen - an already running cloud communications service (e.g. twilio.com and nexmo.com). One ten digit number was purchased per suitcase; each call is redirected to an Apache server (on an Ubuntu installation hosted at digitalocean.com/) where a PHP script serves a VoiceXML file with instructions of how the call should be handled (menu options, voice clips etc.); if the user chooses to record a message the story is being recorded and stored on the server; if the user chooses to listen to a message, a random (or sorted) story is being fetched by the server and played back to the user; the messages can be accessed by either calling the equivalent phone number or visiting erithwalks.co.uk.</gtr:description><gtr:id>70818D95-8DFC-4AFD-B7B0-067CB26F94B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The residents and the housing institution were able to collect and distribute place-based stories about the multiple practices and values in and about their estate undergoing urban regeneration.

It is composed entirely of user-generated content from diverse and geographically separated conservation communities across the UK. It features a variety of video, image, sound and text-based content, representing contributions from &amp;gt;40 individuals.

A unique, dynamically generated introduction sequence (composed entirely from the user-generated content) sets the scene for the documentary and also introduces a suite of interactive navigational tools that help audiences explore and create their own interpretations of the content.

Rather than being a 'standalone' artefact, Red Tales integrates with existing ecologies, both online (via social media) and offline (via different co-located communities). Users can 'curate' and share collections of existing content, as well as add new content to a &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; documentary. Our aim was to reflect the heterogeneity of the content and the 'unresolved' nature of the topic. Thus, rather than presenting a linear narrative, audiences are invited to explore and contribute to the documentary through a technical framework and an interaction paradigm that builds equally upon recent research in documentary/media studies and human-computer interaction, and pioneering interactive documentaries (eg Bear71 / 18 Days in Egypt). 

Red Tales was produced through participatory workshops and developed in response to an ethnographic study of the community that revealed its inherent diversity, several shared concerns and hundreds of individuals' stories. In making the film, we adopted a collaborative, multidisciplinary and participatory approach and we have drawn upon - and hope to contribute new to knowledge to - the AHRC's digital-economy and knowledge-exchange programmes. 

Through making this film, we have gained unique insights into knowledge exchange methods that bridge the worlds of academia, industry and the voluntary/charity sectors and the role digital technology can play in forging new experiences, supporting grassroots communities and producing non-linear documentary narratives.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFC93689-AF82-4A4B-AA11-593EF96A5B93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several articles in the mainstream press</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Red Tales iDoc</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.redtales.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of the Pacitti Companies Performing Collections, we were invited to respond during the course of a winter residency in 2014 to a number of artefacts from the natural history collection at Ipswich Museum in the UK. Using the artefacts as materials we designed and developed a number of sonic instruments and used forms of data sonification to create a multi-channel sound and image installation. The work was developed through a series of public 'drop in' workshops during which a more recognisable exhibition form gradually evolved. Other than a commitment to work with natural history artefacts, the only other constraints set in advance were the title of the residency and the technologies and skills we brought with us. We entitled the residency Interglacial/Erratics to bring to mind a connection between our era and that of glaciation and to play metaphorically with the notion of an 'erratic', the geological term for a rock carried from its indigenous place to another by glacial forces.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C2C055D9-E48C-42A3-A049-B5F7F16E05F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During our residency we had over 50 visitors engaging in our activities.

Hidden by a lovely veneer, Chattr participants adventured into dystopian space, a caf&amp;eacute; governed by social media rules, in which they had to negotiate unknown boundaries between physical - digital, private - public, live - archived, local - global.

At a first glance Chattr might look as an access restricted area, conversely Chattr was presented as the utterly public environment. Under the slogan 'your privacy is very important to us', Chattr provided a temporary hybrid space in which participants could kick back and enjoy a coffee while sharing their chats with an online community.

Chattr mirrored the Terms of Service of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn. By choosing to access Chattr lounge, participants accepted the Data Use Policy, which required them to carry a recording device within Chattr confines. All spoken conversations would then be recorded, transcribed and archived in a publicly accessible database that shall remain permanently in a public space online. Thus, Chattr's operational model relayed on the generation of an archive of popular culture as a by-product of participant's social interactions within the caf&amp;eacute;.

Chattr is conceived following the operational model of digital social networks, providing a service in exchange for participant's privacy, aiming to build up a publicly accessible archive of private conversations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>756911AC-8A0B-44CE-8CB5-0BF375F497F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FutureEverything, Manchester with 500 attendees</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Chattr (FutureEverything)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Three artefact designs were developed as part of the On The Precipice project which incorporated audience feedback data.

Swaythe Band is designed to help participants sway to the music by illustrating a song's tempo. Players (or members of our band) are given a PlayStation Move controller (or baton). During a song, participants hold the controller as the LED light at its top changes colour in time to the beat of the music. The controllers are connected to a central computer via Bluetooth (using the PS Move API ) which dictates the colour and timing. This configuration is able to support up to eight participants with the computer being additionally responsible for playing the music.

In the example presented at Create4Dementia, the timing of the lights was hardcoded to accompany &amp;quot;The Shrimp Boats&amp;quot;, a song by Jo Stafford (1951).

In the versions post Create4Dementia Swaytheband is fully configurable allowing different beats and tunes to be created. This is done via the XML file which is read by the program as it loads.

Swaythe Band is more than just its software outputs. It's important to note how we used the PlayStation controllers. There were treated (and called) batons during the experience and given a rope textured handle, drawing inspiration from the trawling nets on the 'shrimp boats'. This made them easy to hold, pleasing to look at, and soft, should they be dropped. Correspondingly we also decided on the colour of the controllers should be the colour (Little Greene Shrimp Pink / #f7c7a9) when resting.</gtr:description><gtr:id>278D003C-0B10-438C-A4CA-127F57655B60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Swaythe Band won Best Project at the Create 4 Dementia hackathon at the Great North Museum, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

Anyone can simply call a landline or mobile from the phone by dialling the desired number. People with inclusive mobile phone plans are invited to donate some of their free minutes by connecting to the NoPayPhone as a bluetooth handset. Each call is randomly routed through one of the nearby donor phones. By donating free minutes you are helping to build an open, ad-hoc community resource. By virtually lending your mobile to strangers you are also adding unknown calls to your mobile phone bill. NoPayPhone explores the notion of phone boxes as a symbol of privacy, and helps to confuse targeted advertising and profiling by your mobile phone operator and any third-party surveillance of call metadata.

Using the artefacts as materials we designed and developed a number of sonic instruments and used forms of data sonification to create a multi-channel sound and image installation. The work was developed through a series of public 'drop in' workshops during which a more recognisable exhibition form gradually evolved. Other than a commitment to work with natural history artefacts, the only other constraints set in advance were the title of the residency and the technologies and skills we brought with us. We entitled the residency Interglacial/Erratics to bring to mind a connection between our era and that of glaciation and to play metaphorically with the notion of an 'erratic', the geological term for a rock carried from its indigenous place to another by glacial forces.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9D74A3A4-F198-4451-9A88-391D68131017</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During our residency we had over 50 visitors engaging in our activities.

Tess worked with her collaborator to use performance making techniques to explore the effect that environmental rhythms have on everyday experience, and responded to these rhythms to form the basis of a live performance walk.

In August 2014 they presented a walking performance which took audience members on a guided route around Holy Island where they encountered live performance and participated in performative activities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>00D0EA1F-88BC-49CF-B258-9F189E23BEE1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project R-hythm developed a collaborative approach to working with people to interrogate their own relationship to a specific context, in this case the context of Holy Island. The project demonstrates how an open, experimental and highly collaborative approach to participatory practice can be managed and result in valuable insights concerning lived experience of particular issues. 

Project R-hythm culminated in 1 performance event that hosted a total of 18 people who took part in the performance walk. The audience were aged between 4 - 77yrs of age. 

The project supported the formation of a number of partnerships which house ongoing conversations regarding participatory practices and performance as a collaborative research tool. These partnerships include; Fuel, Fevered Sleep, Ann Light (Northumbria University), Iain Biggs (University of West England).</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Project R-hythm - Tess Denman-Cleaver</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Fields is a networked system exploring new areas of musical performance and spatialised sound through the use of personal mobile technology as a medium for sound diffusion.

Sounds &amp;amp; Guts is engaged in developing new ways in which to work collaboratively with a range of partners who contribute to dialogue around current social, political and ontological issues. As a collaborative project it creates a space in which people can reflect upon their own experiences of particular issue and form opinions or change behaviors in relation to this issue. As an ongoing project Sounds &amp;amp; Guts will go on to experiment with a range of participatory approaches to engaging people with the issue of loneliness through performance making. 

The project resulted in partnerships between a number of individuals, organisations and institutions, including; Queens Hall Arts Centre (Hexham), Live Theatre (Newcastle), The Pacitti Company, residents of Holy Island, Dr. Laura Cull (Surrey University), Northumberland Council, Arts Council England and a number of artists and researchers who were involved in making the performance including Taryn Edmonds (film), Matthew Evans (theatre director), Emma Beverly (theatre producer) and Tim Shaw (sound). These partnerships are ongoing and will underpin Phase 2 of Sounds &amp;amp; Guts

A total of 9 Performances of Sounds &amp;amp; Guts were presented at the following venues; Queens Hall Arts Centre (Hexham), Live Theatre (Newcastle), St Cuthbert's Centre (Holy Island) and SPILL Festival (Ipswich) between September 17th - November 2nd. The total audience attending these performances was 249.

FACT provided access to a large public audience, creative consultation, local knowledge and premises to work in Liverpool. FACT also have strong links with local SMEs who were a target audience for this collaborative work. Stefan Kazassoglou, via his micro-SME Kinicho, brought expertise in 
contemporary sound diffusion technologies and access to a state of the art spatialised sound system - an array of 20 loudspeakers and associated software enabling the creation of immersive third order ambisonic spaces. During the project, Stefan constructed a larger version of his sound system (that was used to present work and stimulate new work) and made several impulse response recordings ('acoustic snapshots') of the locations used (also used as materials in the subsequent creative work). Dr. Magnus Williamson (Newcastle University) brought musicological expertise in European liturgical practices and institutional contexts, 1350-1650, and in the interaction between musical forms, books, ensembles and spaces; he also has brought interests in the role of sound in animating public encounters with lost or 'disappeared' spaces. 
Magnus contributed to critical reflections on the value of the collaborative work (both in Liverpool and in 'disappeared heritage spaces') throughout the project, and is developing further work with CX collaborators as a result.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'Sound Spaces' was a practical and creative exploration of the potential of spatialised (&amp;quot;3-D&amp;quot;) sound through the making of spatialised sound environments that creatively respond to and gain perspectives on how we experience the urban environment. The project unpacked various elements of what the city is, how it might be (re)imagined as 'disappeared' or non-existent spaces and how it could be explored through sonic environments as material (Ingold, 2013). Through public and SME participation, the project also investigated how SMEs might incorporate spatialised sound in their own creative, technical and public engagement activities. The project was focussed on the city of Liverpool beginning with a four-day public making workshop as part of FACT Liverpool's Build Your Own: Tools for Sharing exhibition programme. During this workshop, participants explored the use of spatialised sound by, for example, creating a fictional map of Liverpool based on the sonic affinities of places within the city ('Soundlines' - one part leyline, one part songline). The workshop also explored the use of inexpensive, self-made technology and sophisticated ambisonic systems (Kinicho) for the creation of digitally spatialised sound environments. CX researchers facilitated the four-day workshop and a later week-long exhibition/residency at FACT. In these activities, CX researchers produced creative work in collaboration with partners and members of the public, and individually, bringing expertise in creative practice and practice-led research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Mitacs</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>A Walk in the Park</gtr:description><gtr:id>C7F06E77-B30F-4187-B78F-A32F25EF4D80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mydex PDS (Personal Data Store) browser data plugin and visualisations; New Cloud Atlas; Mydex Personal Data Store browsing trails Interface and Browser Plugin; INDX Personal Data Store browser data App; Pseudonymity in social machines (paper)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Mydex, represented by David Alexander, Phil Booth and Chris Adams, contributed prototyping of Mydex's Personal Data Store (PDS), developing visualisation and curation tools, hosting field trial 'sandbox' and post-trial website, and preparing technical field trial tutorial material.

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

Consequently, attempts to capture and communicate the heritage of crafts practices might miss important aspects of practitioners' skills and experiences. This project explored the design, development and utilisation of technologies to support the capture and presentation of these intangible aspects of craft practice in two ways. Firstly, by developing a sonification system which translates craft gestures into live audio feedback and secondly by making tangible artefacts from and with the practitioner's movement data. CX researchers faciliated a series of practical and discussion workshops with craft practitioners, developed and iteratively refined a sonification system (gesture-capture tools and software), and produced a series of tangible artefacts based on the gesture data captured.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Imperial College London (ICL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Life Sciences (encompassing Biology)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Polyphonic Futures</gtr:description><gtr:id>006BFFA1-9FC6-461F-B1BB-43CB55BF08CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Polyphonic futures is a multi-disciplinary collaboration:

The exhibition design made use of prop-like frames to delineate space within the gallery and to position the visitor as an integral part of the setting.

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

The residents would like to create walks around the year to establish a connection with new residents and between the past and future of the area. Clara made several visits to Erith Park to build relationships with residents, run participatory workshops, and co-design the digital walking.

It has enabled the opportunity to work anywhere, anytime. Yet digital space simultaneously lacks geographic substance; it is both nowhere and everywhere. This project responded to a growing need for design solutions that reduce psychological distance to foster a sense of connectedness in distributed working. It explored how digital visualisations of workspaces can create a sense of being local in digital space and enrich human experience independent of geography, and resulted in the development of a new prototype app. CX PhD researcher Ben Dalton contributed research and design expertise, produced a prototypical digital app, organised workshops and public activities, and disseminated the research at events and in publications.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Foundation for Art and Creative Technology (FACT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sound Spaces</gtr:description><gtr:id>A64CFD96-E5DC-4F8D-B83C-6DEBAF161E5F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sound Spaces exhibition/performance</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Foundation for Creative Technology (FACT) has an established interest in making, new technologies, the city of Liverpool, creative practice and methodologies for evaluating publically-engaged creative work. FACT provided access to a large public audience, creative consultation, local knowledge and premises to work in Liverpool. FACT also have strong links with local SMEs who were a target audience for this collaborative work. Stefan Kazassoglou, via his micro-SME Kinicho, brought expertise in 
contemporary sound diffusion technologies and access to a state of the art spatialised sound system - an array of 20 loudspeakers and associated software enabling the creation of immersive third order ambisonic spaces. During the project, Stefan constructed a larger version of his sound system (that was used to present work and stimulate new work) and made several impulse response recordings ('acoustic snapshots') of the locations used (also used as materials in the subsequent creative work). Dr. Magnus Williamson (Newcastle University) brought musicological expertise in European liturgical practices and institutional contexts, 1350-1650, and in the interaction between musical forms, books, ensembles and spaces; he also has brought interests in the role of sound in animating public encounters with lost or 'disappeared' spaces. 
Magnus contributed to critical reflections on the value of the collaborative work (both in Liverpool and in 'disappeared heritage spaces') throughout the project, and is developing further work with CX collaborators as a result.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>'Sound Spaces' was a practical and creative exploration of the potential of spatialised (&amp;quot;3-D&amp;quot;) sound through the making of spatialised sound environments that creatively respond to and gain perspectives on how we experience the urban environment. The project unpacked various elements of what the city is, how it might be (re)imagined as 'disappeared' or non-existent spaces and how it could be explored through sonic environments as material (Ingold, 2013). Through public and SME participation, the project also investigated how SMEs might incorporate spatialised sound in their own creative, technical and public engagement activities. The project was focussed on the city of Liverpool beginning with a four-day public making workshop as part of FACT Liverpool's Build Your Own: Tools for Sharing exhibition programme. During this workshop, participants explored the use of spatialised sound by, for example, creating a fictional map of Liverpool based on the sonic affinities of places within the city ('Soundlines' - one part leyline, one part songline). The workshop also explored the use of inexpensive, self-made technology and sophisticated ambisonic systems (Kinicho) for the creation of digitally spatialised sound environments. CX researchers facilitated the four-day workshop and a later week-long exhibition/residency at FACT. In these activities, CX researchers produced creative work in collaboration with partners and members of the public, and individually, bringing expertise in creative practice and practice-led research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ind.ie</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Indiedata</gtr:description><gtr:id>FB8B6FE5-A5FE-4198-AAC4-3D74324449F4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Ind.ie

As events unfold, emoto processes global twitter data and analyses the messages for content and emotional tone, which is then fed back to the viewer providing greater insight in real-time. After the Games, a physical data sculpture at the Cultural Olympiad closing event provides a truly unique interactive archive of the online response to London 2012.

Based on analysis of approx. 12.5 million Twitter messages, emoto presented both the big picture, the world from above, as well as the intimate and personal details enabling the viewer to zoom right in to specific detail.

Consequently, attempts to capture and communicate the heritage of crafts practices might miss important aspects of practitioners' skills and experiences. This project explored the design, development and utilisation of technologies to support the capture and presentation of these intangible aspects of craft practice in two ways. Firstly, by developing a sonification system which translates craft gestures into live audio feedback and secondly by making tangible artefacts from and with the practitioner's movement data. CX researchers faciliated a series of practical and discussion workshops with craft practitioners, developed and iteratively refined a sonification system (gesture-capture tools and software), and produced a series of tangible artefacts based on the gesture data captured.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Our Life Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Blockanomics</gtr:description><gtr:id>AAFFEEC0-156D-4AAB-BC94-2A4420CFAD3D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blockonomics: UKAuthority press article</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>DGKCT LTD

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov.

The RSA has pioneered the use of offline social network analysis as a means of achieving social policy outcomes by analysing people's social relationships and seeing how they impact on wellbeing, life satisfaction and other life outcomes. However, this approach is resource intensive; the LocalNets tool automated the process of community asset discovery to help community-focused organisations identify and understand community concerns and issues more efficiently.

This is a whole new way to experience and make sense of the pulse of the Olympic Games.

Emoto captures and visualises the global response around the London 2012 Olympic Games on Twitter in an interactive online visualisation and physical data sculpture. As events unfold, emoto processes global twitter data and analyses the messages for content and emotional tone, which is then fed back to the viewer providing greater insight in real-time. After the Games, a physical data sculpture at the Cultural Olympiad closing event provides a truly unique interactive archive of the online response to London 2012.

Based on analysis of approx. 12.5 million Twitter messages, emoto presented both the big picture, the world from above, as well as the intimate and personal details enabling the viewer to zoom right in to specific detail. The dynamic nature of evolving news stories within the Olympic Games could be followed online via emoto, providing greater insight in real-time and an alternative perspective to that found in standard (eg TV) sport media coverage, or in the live experience for fans.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Red Ninja</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Open Planning</gtr:description><gtr:id>9DB559CC-038D-470B-AD3F-555C62B9F72F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>An investigation of current limitations when engaging the public in the urban planning process, and developing new systems using narrative processes and digital technologies such as visualisation to better articulate and understand design proposals.

We propose an extension of this model, whereby the existing partners in TILO are considered similar to the partners within a standard cluster project and we propose two of the existing CX postgraduate researchers are allocated to the project alongside an academic, with Professor Rachel Cooper as a research sponsor and mentor and Dr Andrew Quick as the lead academic.

Whereas the standard CX cluster consists of short, intense research projects running for a few months. We propose a longitudinal approach, whereby postgraduate researchers would be allocated for the 12-month lifecycle of the project at 20%. These researchers would be allocated in kind alongside a budgeted academic (Dr Quick). 

The IOCP are primarily researching the psychological and physiological reaction to the direct experience of interacting with TILO and its affect on brand perception and the locus of control. The CX research would be focused more on evaluating the Arts and cultural sector significance of the results and the strategic organizational opportunities. The emphasis would be on locating the research results within other related digital arts projects, disseminating the information within the arts community and looking at the potential and actual artistic and cultural impact. Both research timelines would run in parallel and be integrated and each strand would inform the other.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bretton Buzz</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC9B307B-7F5E-4367-847C-61216762C43B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster: Localnets - Mapping Communities Using Twitter; Exhibit of LocalNets webapp at Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design Creative Citizen conference; What does House of Cards tell us about big data culture?</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Arianna Haberis, Miriam Levin, Ed Ridout (Department for Communities and Local Government) provided feedback on the usefulness of the LocalNets app in a policy context.

The local area has suffered from high deprivation with several social issues including health and crime for many years, and is currently undergoing regeneration. The residents would like to create walks around the year to establish a connection with new residents and between the past and future of the area. Clara made several visits to Erith Park to build relationships with residents, run participatory workshops, and co-design the digital walking.

As that was very low (2 days per company), a lot of the work fell to Phds to undertake as we had to manage the company input very strategically. 

Because Alpha set out to influence and change something that wasn't within any of our remits it was challenging to actually achive the grand aim of fixing procurement, however we did achieve the majority of our research aims as scoped for the first phase. 

We achieved an empirical review of 'good' procurement from the reports and literature, we mapped out the landscape and factors of influence on Procurement within the BBC, we plotted and assessed the impact of previous intervention within the system and devised tools to measure procurement effectiveness and how the experience lined up with company strategy. 

Bringing together this learning, we recognized that a toolkit or report would not have the influence on the area that we liked and instead we formed 'the ministry of good procurement' which brought together our learning into a manifesto of good procurement and seeks to champion 'good procurement' using more guerilla tactics.
Throughout the project our partners, both academic and comoany were meeting with people creating policy and procurement guidelines. We fed some findings to them directly as we went, but largey the experience and relationship with them led to us considering alternative approaches to disseminate our findings as they said they were overrun with reports and toolkits.

The project and our approach was influential on developing networks between CX and Helsinki, supported by PROUD, Emma Murphy ran a Masterclass featuring the Alpha approach to mapping the Factors of Influence, our findings and recommendations on empathy and our Manifesto with Jussi in Helsiki. 

The Ministry for Good procurement and its associated brand collateral has great potential for impact but requires a full website building and a system so that users can sign up to the manifesto for good procurement and also input their thoughts. We are discussing bringing both the ministry and the Helsinki model of procurement to fieldtrial or a second stage project with FutureGov. That would secure significant impact on the highly complex landscape of procurement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>University of Dundee:

We propose an extension of this model, whereby the existing partners in TILO are considered similar to the partners within a standard cluster project and we propose two of the existing CX postgraduate researchers are allocated to the project alongside an academic, with Professor Rachel Cooper as a research sponsor and mentor and Dr Andrew Quick as the lead academic.

Whereas the standard CX cluster consists of short, intense research projects running for a few months. We propose a longitudinal approach, whereby postgraduate researchers would be allocated for the 12-month lifecycle of the project at 20%. These researchers would be allocated in kind alongside a budgeted academic (Dr Quick). 

The IOCP are primarily researching the psychological and physiological reaction to the direct experience of interacting with TILO and its affect on brand perception and the locus of control. The CX research would be focused more on evaluating the Arts and cultural sector significance of the results and the strategic organizational opportunities. The emphasis would be on locating the research results within other related digital arts projects, disseminating the information within the arts community and looking at the potential and actual artistic and cultural impact. Both research timelines would run in parallel and be integrated and each strand would inform the other.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Manchester</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Bretton Buzz</gtr:description><gtr:id>D429F49D-6CCC-4CB6-94AE-3E4329BCBBD7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster: Localnets - Mapping Communities Using Twitter; Exhibit of LocalNets webapp at Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design Creative Citizen conference; What does House of Cards tell us about big data culture?</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Arianna Haberis, Miriam Levin, Ed Ridout (Department for Communities and Local Government) provided feedback on the usefulness of the LocalNets app in a policy context.

Visitors to the cafe will be presented with a choice of whether to participate in the Chatter social area or not. They will be asked if they agree to have their voices recorded, transcribed and published on the internet, and will then be asked to accept a Data Use Policy. The cafe will use a colour coding system to remind visitors of their choice. Only visitors who have accepted to have their voices recorded and published will be allowed to enter the Chatter social area. Transcripts of recordings will be uploaded online and publicly accessible permanently.

The RSA has pioneered the use of offline social network analysis as a means of achieving social policy outcomes by analysing people's social relationships and seeing how they impact on wellbeing, life satisfaction and other life outcomes.

HCI has been involved in democracy-related research in a number of ways, from usability studies assessing systems in use (e.g. e-voting systems) to ethnographic studies exploring democratic practices and values of local communities.

We invited researchers and practitioners from the fields of maker communities, DIY electronics, design for democracy, socially engaged arts etc. to submit 200-500 words abstract (by email here) describing a context that you have worked in or designed for focusing on the way in which democracy is practiced.

The platform has been launched online, a video has been screened in the gallery, and new members for the platform were aquired through 8 workshop sessions, based on drop-in sign-ups. Firstly, the new members were introduced to the bio-digital enabling material silk in a brief hands-on session, secondly, they contributed their own version of a biomaterial future via a paper sheet, that was then photographed and uploaded via Ipads to the platforms' data base. During these days 45 new members were gained for the platform, excellent feedback was given for the design and structure of the platform. During this busy publicly accessible event, people have expressed throughout an explicit wish to be further involved in public-facing science-design intiatives like Polyphonic Futures, which helped solidifying the research hypothesis with this project. 
The V&amp;amp;A curator of the Digital Design weekend expressed the wish to further collaborate in the future.

The exhibition is showcased in the FACT Connects space between 17 - 25 June, exploring how digital resources from smartphones to Facebook have transformed what each of us can learn, make and do.
Visitors are invited to explore how designers, makers and artists have worked across public and private sectors to develop new concepts, products, services and infrastructures. Responding to today's complex picture of technological risk and opportunity, the exhibition will present collaborations that cross between education, industry and government, revealing emergent intersections between digital technologies and our everyday lives.
Designing Digital Now looks into how digital things can be imagined, designed and made in ways guided by our creative and ethical needs, rather than the functional capabilities of digital technology. The exhibition features prototype products, infographics and films alongside a number of interactive exhibits from smartphone apps to a giant collaborative drawing machine. A programme of events will accompany the exhibition, ranging from workshops on digital games or self-publishing magazines. Visitors are invited to contribute their own stories to a digital map of Liverpool, become part of a participatory documentary or experience a live audio walk around the city.
The exhibition is part of a special programme of pop-up exhibitions which is showcased this spring and summer in the FACT Connects space, in the foyer at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology). FACT Connects is a wide-ranging programme, which engages with members of the community, and allows FACT to connect even more with artists, musicians, and makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/designing-digital-now-exhibition-17-25th-june-fact-liverpool</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Browser history comics</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20F11D10-9F50-42AE-98C4-D3CD49064E7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>50 people drew comic book versions of their browser history lists as the result of three separate workshops in London, Nottingham, and Liverpool.

This then led to the creation of the digital game i-dentity in collaboration with RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

The abstract follows:

Games are a type of play, but there is also an experience of play within games. This play is the experimental aspect of the game. It allows a person to be expressive and creative which makes these new experiences significant and meaningful [4]. It is why future games and new pervasive sensors will focus on play. These new interfaces will support play through an understanding of spoken language and the ability to determine the body position precisely without latency. They will recognise expressiveness, identify the player's mood and even read lips. This behavioural information will ensure the play in games is natural, spontaneous and appropriate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transmit/Receive</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>64AD272D-BB24-446C-9BF3-987FFE299081</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The First World War accelerated technological innovation. Many of the devices developed were used to generate or listen to sound for communication purposes. From radio broadcasts to early underwater microphones, listening was a key strategy in the war effort. Many accounts of the war recollect sound as the primary sensory experience yet no sound recordings actually exist. There is an interesting space for creatively imagining what these technologies actually sounded like. In this project we aim to rebuild some of these once innovative technologies, many of which are still being used and developed today. Through engaging with how these devices were made we hope to bring a creative and contemporary perspective to this time of technological progress.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://transmit-receive.tumblr.com</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Activism in Sociology Conference at BSA in London - Clara Crivellaro</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A821E21C-03A0-4FA9-9563-0DE0D1918BE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked interest in future collaborations from another University.

With the merging of the 'real' with the virtual on and off-line, 'play' with the creation of multiple 'selves' is now commonplace. This offers limitless opportunities for impersonation, deception and fakery; useful tools for political counter-strategies, but also the roots for anxieties regarding loss of control over issues of 'real' identity. So what are the implications for the material realities of the body in the mangled and mutable unreal 'real' of the virtual, digital realm?

Featuring presentations from Dr Shehnaz Suterwalla, Noam Toran, Onkar Kular, Ben Dalton and Leslie Kulesh, participants use the term 'authenticity' as a prism through which to explore and challenge questions regarding impersonation, politics and gendered resistance, addressing the question of whether the faked, forged, inauthentic multitude-identities afforded by the digital era are a cause for panic, or a point of potential?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ica.org.uk/whats-on/authenticity-real-bodies</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wild Man Game</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF629FC0-25D7-49DF-8214-2325A8B2E92A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Wild Man Game is a mobile phone based game that engages visitors in a unique experience at a heritage destination - English Heritage's Belsay Hall. The game was created in collaboration with staff from the heritage site and a specialist in eighteenth-century culture from the Newcastle University.

In a series of workshops with a senior curator at English Heritage we rediscovered the motif of a Wild Man that is &amp;quot;resident&amp;quot; at this site. This motif was then used to inspire the design of a game that supports social, physical play which visitors can enjoy together. Observation of families using our digital prototype revealed how our game intertwined play with the affordances of the space - such as those of its hidden stories, histories and meaning. Based on our work we suggest that playful digital games create new relationships with our heritage spaces and remove the preconceptions young people have that these places are &amp;quot;stuffy&amp;quot; boring destinations.

The workshops led to the creation of a digital game which we deployed in an evaluation with four families from the general public which allowed us to further refine the game.

We wanted to motivate critical, even subversive, provocative designs that might attempt to raise questions rather than provide technical solutions.

The Create4Dementia hack event hosted 50+ hackers with skills in software, design and healthcare to develop innovative technologies for those living with dementia in 24 hours.

&amp;quot;The current propagation of devices connecting with the body often blurs the underlying motifs of the creators that drive them. Alongside with wearable tech, body interface that quantify everything, notions of control, omnipresence, surveillance, and inescapability are not afar. While makers of these technologies
are focusing on feasibility, manufacturing, biomaterial performance, and ease of use (see 'invisible design'), artists and designers are challenged with the question how to operate and practice in a technological climate increasingly dominated by control.

21st June, 2013

I presented &amp;quot;Play is Serious Business&amp;quot; as part of the fourth seminar with the Centre for Ageing and Biographical Studies (CABS) at the Open University. This featured DoHS.

The theme of this seminar was the translation of ideas into actual benefits for older people - for health, education, sociability, and fun. My presentation looked at the benefits of designing digital technologies for experiences of play.

There were domain experts such as RNIB, Help the Aged, academics and some members of the public.

My talk was 20 minutes - and presented how we can use playful design as a way to challenge current design practices and open up</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to the EUAC, December 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0EE91ED-7A04-493B-BF55-1A596B57EB89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to talk about my research (specifically, the Near Miss Project) to the Environmental Association of Universities and Colleges.

They were carried out through a collaboration with Bad Apples - a community interest company (CIC) in the North East who work with young people.

They took place during Keyfund workshops which are being run at the Bad Apples studios. These workshops are part of a scheme encourages people to find new skills by funding activities where young people manage, lead and take ownership of projects.

Bad Apples are currently using creative-play in these workshops and we looked at augmenting this part of the session with digital play and games. We will explored how this play can encourage the young people to be creative, foster communication across these groups, and help support attachment with the space.

As part of this research we will aim to give young people who do not get a chance to make games an opportunity to participate in the design of digital games and play. We hope that these games can then be used as a tool by other organisations that reach out to new young people.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>City Walks / Walks for Change process</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06911D19-9519-4AB0-9E61-0BCCB273B353</gtr:id><gtr:impact>City Walks is a socio-material, socio-technical process that utilises designed tools, digital artefacts, audio content and digital archives to craft digitally-supported walks in the city to support civic engagement and dialogue between the mechanism and procedure of city planning and practices of place making. The process investigate alternative modes of political participation in discussions about city planning and place making. The process situates political engagement and discussion about the city, in the city itself through the use location based media content access and creation. The process comprises of two parts. In the first part of the process a group of people are invited to do a walk in the city and generate stops, by associating personal design prompts to specific locations along the walk and justify their choice, which are digitally recorded. The group can then access archival material relating to political controversies and mechanism of city planning. At the end of these walks each group generates routes, stops and user generated media content, which is then utilised to construct a walking trail. Other city residents can then do this walking tour to invite other city residents to discover locations and related issues and add their own opinions.

Our aim was to bring people together to share ideas, experiences and concepts as well as build digital prototypes that break-down, problematize and otherwise explore the digital design space around dementia and dementia care. We wanted to motivate critical, even subversive, provocative designs that might attempt to raise questions rather than provide technical solutions.

We made our invitation open to a wide range of people, including: software and hardware developers, designers and practitioners with backgrounds in, for instance, Human-Computer Interaction, interaction design, healthcare or education, or anyone who was interested in identifying new ideas, critiques and digital designs for the care of people with dementia. Teams competed for juried prizes and we provided space for work, rest and creativity as well as food, inspiring speakers, mentors and prototyping hardware and facilities.&amp;quot;

We formed our team with Dave Green, Newcastle University and Kellie Morrissey, UCC, and created Swaythe Band. This digital prototype received the prize for Best Project at the event.

The prototype has now been used for Kellie's fieldwork at UCC and we are awaiting news on a DIS2016 submission.

This was a 20 minute presentation of the i-dentity game to the Lincoln Games Group.

This was given to about 20 students and staff from the group. The framing of the presentation described i-dentity as a game drawn from the tradition of childhood games and play that makes us challenge the way we think about games. 

i-dentity is a body-space game that is played with a tangible interface. i-dentity was designed in the Game Jam at CHI 2013 and inspired by traditional play. The game was motivated by advocates of the New Games Movement, such as Bernard De Koven who suggests that designers should reconsider old playground games and how we play together.

i-dentity used childhood games such as Sleeping Lions and What Time is it Mr. Wolf as a starting point for design. Through role-play and experimentation with digital prototypes we explore how the core elements of these games can be represented digitally and these changed during development of the game. Our paper describes how this crossover from physical play to a digital game created new compelling and social gameplay.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Daemons and Sock-Puppets: Metaphors of Personal Identity for Pseudonymity in Digital Public Spaces (Artefact talk series) - Ben Dalton</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F7CEA46B-81B5-4941-9085-88ACB4A4784A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk in the Artifact Project series to a mixed audience of scientists and artists, students of Imperial College and Royal College of Art along with members of the public.

&amp;quot;This research examines the role of pseudonymity in design practice for digital communication and everyday life. A reoccurring challenge in exploring the potential of digital public space is the creation and control of personal identities. The requirement for people to use a single, 'real-name' identity has emerged as a key concern of social networks, internet commerce and government services online. This is problematic, since identity is often described and understood in terms of multiple facets, performances, characters and masks rather than just a single, 'real' name. Furthermore, there are persuasive pre-digital cases for the value and necessity of pseudonyms in communication and society, including political critique, nom de plume, puppetry, witness protection and identity exploration.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/artifact/about-us/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Austrian Science Council</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>301F9EBB-279C-4F88-8FCB-30AB3E9D7A94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Formal working group member on Art and Design - History, Practice and Theory.

During this two-day workshop, organised in collaboration with The Arts Catalyst as part of the CX Polyphonic Futures project, participants collaboratively explored the potential of reverse engineered silk, currently confined to laboratories. Taking the body as the first site for investigation, Veronica Ranner asked participants to consider themselves as &amp;quot;Living Assembly&amp;quot; that can be hacked, enhanced and patched into through using bio-digital materials. Activities involved material experiments combined with a narrative design process to speculate on silk's possible future use in the world.

In this workshop week we asked students to rethink and explore the full potential of biological materials and transience and what way and manifestations this contrasts existing fossil-fuel derived ones.

&amp;quot;At present, the origins of materials and resources used in our designed electronics and objects are unclear and difficult to trace back. This is mostly the case for fossil-fuel derived and raw materials, such as plastics and precious metals, which require long, complex supply chains all over the globe with multiple geographical sources.
These materials are problematic as such, as they cannot be returned into the ecological material cycle, but lead to hazardous landfills and pacific garbage patches instead. We would like you to develop an understanding how transient materials differ from our current material culture.
What does it mean to design temporary things that are programmable, melt, and disappear on demand and how would they look and feel like?

This then led to the creation of the digital game Intangle in collaboration with RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia.

The abstract follows:

Traditional play and its games offer a unique opportunity for game design research since its games are almost always engaging, creative and fun. They are typical of the well-played games described by Bernard DeKoven. As we look to capture the values of this play in computer games we need new approaches to game design. Game Jams provide a suitable approach; Games Jams are playful, they encourage exploration of rules and boundaries, and through seeking innovation they avoid the mainstays of computer game development.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>THESAURUS: NewBridge</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>73AB9A62-E35D-4B95-B09E-D165DFEEC323</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Development of THESAURUS text from FACT residency.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PRESENTATION: THESAURUS and Preface</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6294BEDF-F0DB-4AC3-AF20-4D995F214392</gtr:id><gtr:impact>THESAURUS and Preface presented at the Critical Practices and Experimentation symposium and workshop, University of Copenhagen and Royal Danish Academy of Art, Copenhagen, Denmark.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>A Future Vision Computer Games; Game Jam at CHI 2013</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8347F58-D3E9-4E6C-88BA-E38C76A2C5C6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Games developers, designers and researchers from across the World met to participate in a 'Game Jam.'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Digital Media Labs 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E6B6217-9363-4B9F-91F3-5E9AF5A81BB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10 of the UK's most innovative digital artists coming together to share in a week of collaboration, experimentation, play and research into interactive art using a variety of sensors and technologies

This then led to plans for extending the game Intangle to a tool for playworkers and youth workers - Talk About Sex.

The abstract for this workshop submission follows:

We are interested in embarrassing interactions as part of wider research that is exploring how play-centric game design allows us to create new engaging play experiences between players and their environment. Embarrassing interactions are an important feature of play and an inevitable facet of games that can be played in the real world. In this abstract we discuss several innovative designs where digital play has given us the opportunity to explore, manage and leverage embarrassment. We describe our method for creating more &amp;quot;playful&amp;quot; games and discuss the type of interactions we expect to experience and capture. We then describe our Wild Man mobile phone game where we find our digital game provides a convenient alibi for unconventional play in a heritage space.

In the actual workshop we explored how designers can leverage embarrassing in order to encourage young people to explore important issues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PRESENTATION: Fertile Futures</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83F2C4AC-87E0-4218-99D8-1D75A1B0DA89</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk &amp;quot;Fertilised Futures&amp;quot; was given as part of the MIDAS Agenda setting workshop.

1) at the design of game for young people in a library
2) deployed the game with a school

To begin exploring the potential of linking play and storytelling together in a library-based game, we held an initial exploratory workshop at Benjamin Road. The participants were the project team, which included two computer scientists, two games designers, an interaction designer, two creative writers, an English teacher, a children's book author and a member of library staff. The primary aim of the workshop was to develop a common understanding across the team about the potential for using games to engage children in reading and writing about
books. The majority of the workshop was spent with the team working in three small groups and 'experience prototyping' basic games that were acted out in the library. Each group used blank playing cards to make basic prompts that initiated playful interactions with the library's book collection. After prototyping and iterating their games, the groups reconvened to share ideas and created the design for a digital game prototype.

Following this exploratory workshop, we made prompts into an initial card-based playful storytelling game. This was piloted with groups of children aged 8 to 10 years on a school visit to Benjamin Road Library.

The digital version of DoHS was then written and deployed in Benjamin Road Library in two further workshops with the same 20 children who had participated in the pilot study. As before, the children were accompanied by teaching staff. We used the dictation facility on each mobile phone as a way of documenting audio from the workshop, which enabled us to capture the children's conversations both in the workshop room and in the library space itself. This was supplemented by field notes from each researcher detailing interactions between children, teachers and facilitators as well as the children's use of the library space. DoHS also logged interactions with books for later analysis.

Over the course of the two 2-hour workshops, the twenty children collected 109 books. The books chosen by them to incorporate into their stories were diverse, ranging from non-fiction such as books on the geography of Asia, to fiction such as Alice in Wonderland and Dracula. The relative freedom that we provided for the children to explore the library also meant that there were instances where children picked books from the adult section, much to the bemusement and occasional concern of the teachers. 10 of the 109 books in total were used by both of the workshop.

The following paper contains more detail about these workshops:

RITA's main premise is to provide an opportunity for older people across the North East of England to help shape the University's research agenda by suggesting research projects ideas and by highlighting questions that are pivotal to the experiences and lives of older people. The competition is also intended as a way to support research engagement by members of regional U3A's - both by learning about latest research or undertaking research themselves - and as such emphasising the original values of cooperative and lifelong learning that the U3A organisation was initially founded upon.
Since March 2013 we have been running design workshops with U3A 'research ambassadors' who act as advocates for research within their own U3As. In these workshops we have been both support them developing research ideas and to explore what it means for there to be a 'research culture' within the U3A. We have been doing this through a combination of methods that allow them to share personal stories related to research, to deliberate in groups on what makes meaningful research activity, to reflect on the challenges they have faced within their own local U3As as advocates of research, and to provide informal feedback and critique to other peoples project ideas. The project so far has revealed a great many challenges related to preconceptions of the value of different approaches to research and how to support a diverse set of individuals with different levels of commitment and interest to research in engaging in their own research activities. At the same time, it is providing interesting insight into alternative notions of undertaking citizen science, which is often limited to treating the public as a node to collect information for scientific pursuits.
Our work on the project is open-ended but is likely to continue through to the development of digital tools and resources for U3A members and Research Ambassadors to co-ordinate their research activities with each other.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Quantified Self (summer school - Denmark)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>42DE29F7-25DF-4B52-8172-3B64042196F6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a summer school exploring the fundamentals of data by looking at a data source close to home, namely ourselves.

Each participant chose some type of personal activity to monitor and analyze, learning something about the obsessiveness of the data-driven world view in the process. Once collected, we looked at how data can be visualized. Processing will be our primary tool for visualization, allowing us to exploit the power of computation to do statistical analysis and help us generate custom visuals by mapping properties found in the data set to suitable visual structures that simultaneously clarify and illuminate the ideas we wish to communicate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ciid.dk/education/summer-school/ciid-summer-school-2013/quantified-self/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation.

Premiering at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology), The Creative Exchange presents the new exhibition Designing Digital Now, taking a critical look at how we are shaping digital technologies and, in turn, how digital technologies are shaping us. The exhibition is showcased in the FACT Connects space between 17 - 25 June, exploring how digital resources from smartphones to Facebook have transformed what each of us can learn, make and do. Visitors are invited to explore how designers, makers and artists have worked across public and private sectors to develop new concepts, products, services and infrastructures. Responding to today's complex picture of technological risk and opportunity, the exhibition will present collaborations that cross between education, industry and government, revealing emergent intersections between digital technologies and our everyday lives. Designing Digital Now looks into how digital things can be imagined, designed and made in ways guided by our creative and ethical needs, rather than the functional capabilities of digital technology. The exhibition features prototype products, infographics and films alongside a number of interactive exhibits from smartphone apps to a giant collaborative drawing machine. A programme of events will accompany the exhibition, ranging from workshops on digital games or self-publishing magazines. Visitors are invited to contribute their own stories to a digital map of Liverpool, become part of a participatory documentary or experience a live audio walk around the city. The exhibition is part of a special programme of pop-up exhibitions which is showcased this spring and summer in the FACT Connects space, in the foyer at FACT (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology). FACT Connects is a wide-ranging programme, which engages with members of the community, and allows FACT to connect even more with artists, musicians, and makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/designing-digital-now-exhibition-17-25th-june-fact-liverpool</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Red Tales - Design Fictions Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9D886AE5-7B56-45FE-83C8-9F784588E978</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A 1-day workshop that asked 8 invited participants from a variety of professional organisations (conservation charity, film festival organiser, wildlife media organisation, screenwriter, etc) to reflect upon a series of prepared 'fictions' about an existing interactive documentary, also produced during the CX project (Red Tales).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference workshop: Exploring future models of Executive Education in Design Management - an MBA for Design Management?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9E442ED-E3AB-449B-AA09-89CBF25E94A2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A three hour workshop was held which included ideation activities around the topic, discussion and development of possible new solutions for executive education in design.

I formed a team with one undergrad and a lecturer in games to create an Imaginary Skip Rope game.

This game was interesting because unlike traditional Skip Rope our game is a little more forgiving - there is a relatively low risk of injury since you can jump to any height, we could introduce dynamic balancing to give new players an advantage, you could play it remotely over the Internet, there's no right and wrong answer (you're not out when you get hit), and best of all, you use your imagination.

We simulate the rope using verlet integration - so the game is authentically reproducing a rope behind the scenes. Players can collide with the rope when it is at the low point in the travel, unless of course they jump.

We integrate to find the position of the blue/red controllers which we use to spin the rope. To detect when the central players have jumped we measure the magnitude of the movement of the white controllers.

Players are given a &amp;quot;rolling start&amp;quot; by letting the end players &amp;quot;arm&amp;quot; the PlayStation Move controllers once players are ready. Each game lasts only twenty seconds - the best player is indicated by giving them a green light, the other, a red light.

What Do We Do Now? was the theme to GGJ15. As players on both sides of the rope - we become a little bit of the game engine - what do we do now? Do we play nice or do we go fast?

At the end of the Game Jam this was presented to the students on Lincoln's games programming course and I was able to release the code for them to see how it was created.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/imaginary-skip-rope</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Being There: Artists and Geeks workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D21CEDC4-5510-4E59-8C0E-F76136D6F506</gtr:id><gtr:impact>WE ARE CALLING

&amp;quot;This talk presents co-performance as a potential tool for anonymous pseudonymity. We can define anonymised pseudonyms as identities for communication, untraceably disassociated from a performer, that are persistent in use long enough to establish some measure of social reputation. Digitally authoring or controlling an identity allows for provenance to be hidden through cryptographic systems. However, mass storage and processing can uncover 'signatures' and 'fingerprints' in diverse communication modes. These include approaches as varied as writing style, time-of-day analysis, and camera or other hardware profiling.

Anonymous pseudonyms enable creative experimentation and are a healthy extension of multifaceted identity. Historical norms in writing, performance and innovation demonstrate the broad-reaching benefit of creativity under the security of invented names and characters. On the web, particularly in the early years of the internet, easy forms of anonymous reputation management have proven invaluable for numerous contexts of social interaction and debate. Untraceable pseudonyms also make open critique and whistleblowing possible.

Co-performed identities, in which multiple people control a single character, offer an opportunity for increasing the complexity of attempts at 'fingerprinting'. Examples are presented to illustrate this design space, including historical cases such as Nicolas Bourbaki, expert co-performers such as commercial puppeteers, and trends in internet use in which prototype co-performed identities seem to have spontaneously emerged.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://vimeo.com/119157252</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ageing Playfully: Our favourite things Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>73EE5E3A-2C6A-4A23-9A76-EF41AADAD073</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In our first in a series of workshops the team used playful and creative ways to explore the range and type of activities enjoyed by all.

Debate on massive scale data publishing and DIY zine history.

&amp;quot;During this evening of talks, thought experiments and curiosities, three incredible speakers tackle ideas of perception and how we respond to new information.

Professional magician and slight-of-hand artist, Tony O'Neill, experimental jazz musician and neuroscientist Christophe de B&amp;eacute;zenac and digital artist Ben Dalton will talk.

Ben Dalton's talk 'Zines in the age of 'big data'?' introduces and proposes the idea of bundle publishing. At odds with current trends in digital distribution, bundle publishing involves editing a large collection of digital content and then publishing it on a specific date as a single, large ?le. Inspired, in part, by the Humble Indie Bundle initiative as a means of pay what you want, charity supporting, DRM Free, cross-platform game distribution. Dalton asks what forms these user funded digital publications may take and what issues there may be surrounding distribution. This talk aims to raise questions about design, the future of live broadcast, crowd access to 'big data' and the role of spectacle in digital public space as a means of creating masquerade.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.thesuperposition.org/005magicperception/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wild Man Game presented in Korea</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B002BD53-19C0-4D3A-9089-75D2AE9BF59B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Wild Man Game has just been presented at a Serious Games' symposium and at the British Embassy in Seoul, Korea.

The Wild Man Game formed my part of two talks on Serious Games in Seoul, Korea.

The talks were part of a special invitation from Prof. William Latham | Goldsmiths and Dr. Brigitta Zics | Ravensbourne who have received British Embassy support to set up a knowledge exchange network in Serious Games &amp;amp; Gamification and facilitate a Symposium between Korea and UK researchers, industry experts and academics.

The visit spanned a week with an initial networking event between Seoul National University, Korea University, UCL and Goldsmiths that looked to create a common ground for future exchanges between UK- Korea and generate a platform for collaborative projects.

Our colleagues hope that this event will be a starting point for long-standing exchanges between UK and Korea delegates with research interest on games, serious games and gamification.

The presenters view on games challenged the audience on gamification using the Wild Man as an example. For example, in relating this to psychology, he discussed how play can drive change around meaning and attitudes, while gaming can often be link with excelling against a ruleset.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://thecreativeexchange.org/activity/wild-man-game-bridges-digital-seoul</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CX Conference.

Specifically we focussed on:
Academics developing new understandings of the creative sector
New and innovative forms of academic collaboration with creative sector partners
New processes, tools or approaches that facilitate knowledge exchange and collaboration
Members of the creative commercial sector who are interested in moving into academia and starting to undertake research.

We invited six citizens (teachers, parish councilors, a local librarian, a church minister) to a workshop to discuss community issues.

Many of the participants didn't know each other.

The parish council explained to the group that it was running a survey of local residents. Bretton has a large Polish community, and the parish council could not afford to translate the survey into Polish, which limited the effectiveness of the survey.

Teachers from the school said they could encourage bilingual polish-speaking students doing their Duke of Edinburgh award to help administer the survey more widely, as a result 50 extra surveys were completed.

Meeting community needs (survey translation) using an existing community resource (the DoE students) is an example of the value of creating new community connections.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://localnets.org</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation at DIS'14 (Volvelles, Domes and Wristbands paper)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E63228B-06E0-4D33-B4FE-2D3179E1EA74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation of &amp;quot;Volvelles, Domes and Wristbands: Embedding Digital Fabrication within a Visitor's Trajectory of Engagement&amp;quot; at DIS'14 to academic audiences making new contacts with peers in my field</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Thinking Digital Conference - Data Translations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>41049803-ABF5-4CD3-9561-B77C2DF28B6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approx. 500 attendees to a conference participated in this 3D printing activity sparking conversations about the relationship between the digital and the physical.

The goal of the workshop is to reflect on how HCI research can contribute to democracy, taking into consideration the heavily subjective nature of both &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; as a value and &amp;quot;participation&amp;quot; as a means to achieve it.

HCI has been involved in democracy-related research in a number of ways, from usability studies assessing systems in use (e.g. e-voting systems) to ethnographic studies exploring democratic practices and values of local communities. However, the vast amount of work in HCI focuses on exploring citizens' democratic interactions without questioning the participatory and democratic assumptions underlying them.

We hosted 30 researchers within this area for a 1 day workshop to explore this topic.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hci-democracy.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Several invited talks at Cycle City Active City 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3A0CB43D-39BA-451E-A02C-82242B5FF675</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Several talks at Cycle City Active City, including:

Through this activity, we also developed
capacity and capability in creative businesses and developed public service innovation. The demonstrable impact of the CX Hub can be described under three headings - economic impact, social impact and cultural impact.
This project resulted in over 100 new concepts for products and services, these are being adopted to varying degrees by the partner organisations. 
The 42 academics involved in the work are also using the KE Techniques in their working practices and developing further KE with similar or the same partnering organisations.
The 21 PhDs on this novel programme are transferring the knowledge into post doctoral research posts or their own independent practice.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8B89ED50-2B45-4253-AC73-CAA8D30E29D3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Over its four-year funding period, a partnership of Lancaster University, Newcastle University and the Royal College of Art built a dynamic knowledge exchange programme called the Creative Exchange (CX) to stimulate the creative economy in the UK, with a particular focus on the North of England.
Through novel partnerships of academic, industry, public and third sector expertise, and creative applications of digital media and technology in social and cultural contexts, the CX Hub explored new ground in terms of method and approach. It catalysed a series of paradigm shifts in the sector and delivered value through its outputs.
Four Paradigm Shifts
? A shift to a more integrated, cohesive and effective approach to working with small and micro creative and digital business, which have not traditionally engaged with academic research
? A shift from the concept of Digital Public Space as an online cultural archive, as initially proposed by the BBC, to a series of interactive digital public spaces with broader scope for business innovation
? A shift beyond traditional models of PhD research to a more flexible and
dynamic approach better suited to working with creative and cultural SMEs in the sector
? A shift from Knowledge Exchange to Creative Exchange, focusing on the
distinctive quality and value of cross-sector collaboration in the Arts &amp;amp;
Humanities.
Value
The CX Hub:
? Invested &amp;pound;333,237 in 94 projects (core and associated), generating significant value for a network of 176 contributors from 107 connected organisations as well as attracting leveraged funding of more than &amp;pound;1.8 million
? Generated more than 100 concepts and prototypes for new products and
services, creating new IP and 45 new jobs in creative and digital SMEs and in academia
? Produced 21 highly skilled people at Doctoral level who can lead new 'hybrid' thinking both in academia and industry in the creative economy
? Engaged with 150 academics across the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities and other fields and signed up 42 academics to collaboration agreements, developing new models of collaboration that have subsequently been adopted outside the CX Hub
? Secured further research funding of more than &amp;pound;17.5 million by CX partners to address related topics in the creative and digital sector.

The major achievements of the CX Hub can be summarised under four headings: New Thinking on Innovation in Digital Public Space (industry-theory sphere); New Product, Service and Technology Development (industry-practice sphere); New PhD Models and Capacity (academia-theory sphere); and New Forms of KE (academia-practice sphere).
 
The CX focused from the start on the innovation potential of Digital Public Space (DPS), initially working with core partner the BBC at MediaCityUK in Salford and its creative hinterland in the northwest to explore the Corporation's vision of open access online national cultural archives. An achievement of the CX project as a whole has been to radically broaden the concept of DPS to embrace the value creation opportunities in a range of additional digital public spaces resulting from social, civic, health and co-working flows of data. Through papers, events and think tanks, the CX started a profound debate about the future of DPS in the UK, built an autonomous expert forum comprising representatives from such bodies as the BBC, British Library, Wellcome Trust, Wikipedia and Ofcom, and is set to catalyse a Charter for Digital Public Space. This will define and seek to protect the public interest in DPS and will be of huge benefit to the many small creative firms seeking to innovate in this area.
 
New Products and Services
A key achievement of the CX Hub has been to develop new products, services and technologies designed to create new opportunities for creative businesses while bringing benefits to communities in the North of England and beyond. We have evidence of new apps, games and software, alongside spin out company formation
and job creation in micro firms. Four service and product development themes emerged over the life of the Hub:
? Heritage, place and tourism: novel applications of digital technology were used
to re-envision heritage/tourism offers
? Citizen participation: creative digital technologies were adopted to encourage
more open democratic processes in local communities
? Public service redesign: open data and other technology resources were co-opted
to improve local services, from transport to health
? Entrepreneurship: there was particular emphasis on working with hard-to-reach micro-businesses

New PhD Model
A distinctive achievement of the CX Hub lay in the recruitment and supervision of a cohort of 21 PhD students across the three institutions. These PhDs engaged in a series of mini-projects with academics and companies as innovation collaborators
and facilitators. To effectively combine doctoral work with innovation practice and KE required a new mixed-mode PhD model between theoretical enquiry and realworld application to be developed. The result is a new 'hybrid' cohort of researchers in KE who add capacity in the field and will, as they take up new roles, help to re-calibrate approaches across the sector in the future. The PhD cohort also
played a significant role in a deliberate shift of strategy during the project to introduce more informal, iterative and organic models of engagement with the creative economy.

New Forms of Knowledge Exchange
The CX's final major contribution lies in its work on new KE platforms and models, leading to our promotion of the idea that the digitally enabled creative economy requires swift, agile and networked 'Creative Exchange' and not simply a linear 'tech-transfer' model of knowledge exchange which presumes a simple bidirectional
transaction along a single axis of demand-produce-supply. This new
approach was first crystallised in a major two-day KE conference at Lancaster University in September 2013, and subsequently developed in PhD theses,academic papers, further projects and other outputs. In this context, the CX achievement lies in piloting new approaches that demonstrate the different and distinctive qualities that the Arts &amp;amp; Humanities bring to KE, in addition to challenging both academics and supporting university systems to be more responsive and flexible in how they operate. These new forms of KE are now evident in the three partner institutions in the CX Hub.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that the take up from the CX Hub's activity with its partners will be broad-based and diffused over time. Here are some specific activities that we know will be taken forward:
 
? Red Ninja is working with a CX intern to develop the Open Planning software application and implement with city councils 2016-17
(contact: Lee Omar, Red Ninja, lomar@redninja.co.uk)
 
? NHS Preston Hospital is working on phase two of the Blood Data Visualisation app through to full trials 2016 -17

? Development of SME digital engagement with the Digital Catapult Centre in the North East January 2016 -June 2016
(contact: David Dunn, david.dunn@sunderlandsoftwarecity.com)
The CX programme has led to further research investment and will result in significant and wider impact on industry and society in general:
 
? EPSRC IOT PETRAS grant (announced January 2016) in collaboration with UCL,Imperial, Oxford, Warwick and 40 companies includes our partners in CX, BBCand Microsoft, Cooper and Coulton (a CX collaborating academic) are leading on adoption and acceptability, design and behaviour in relation to privacy, ethics and trust (all research topics covered under the CX programme)
 
? EPSRC Digital Civics (Wright and Olivier). This Centre for Doctoral Training is supporting 55 doctoral students over eight years in the design, deployment and evaluation of community-driven digital technologies and services through, for example, the redesign of local services with communities, and the development of at-scale platforms which allow citizens to engage with local government, and
commission their own services (http://digitalcivics.org.uk )
 
? AHRC LEAPFROG (Cruickshank). Co-designing new tools and approaches to facilitate new creative engagement activities in the public sector. The models of Creative Exchange are now being applied to the N8 consortium programme driving clusters of KE and Research under the Urban Living theme (Cooper lead for N8) and Creative and Digital theme (Coulton lead for N8) with support for KE from Professor Cruickshank (director KE on CX).
 
Furthermore, the PhD model is now embedded in the partner organisations and will be further developed and applied. Anticipated impact is also international as we continue to share the model with other universities, for example Gothenburg University and IE University Madrid via staff visits.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD2BD2F4-DA5A-4E69-BF23-F9955AA067E8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>For NESTA we (Andrew Sleigh, Kathleen Stokes, Hannah Stewart) created an open dataset of UK makerspaces.

The invitation was open to both academics and creative industry representatives who had an interest in this area and digital public space including architects, artists, technologists, social studies and urbanism academics and many others.

The goal of the activity was not only to create project concepts but also to build relationships and successful cross-sector interdisciplinary teams. When designing the experience and activities, our priorities based on previous learnings across the Creative Exchange were to provide a safe environment with all partners on equal footing, and to provide engaging experiences that would spark idea generation and form research teams. 

A process of iterative development informed the design of specific tools to meet these goals. These tools included tangible objects to facilitate mechanisms of collaboration. Tools included: 'Hearts and Hats', 'Link Map', 'Thematic Walk', 'Partners Pie' and the 'Journey Booklet'.</gtr:description><gtr:id>00AF7B2F-ED96-4A62-ACEF-BDB4485C3B2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of this event two collaborative projects were funded through The Creative Exchange:

Near Miss: this collaboration between the University of Westminster and SME Blaze ran a national digital survey on cycling 'near misses' and their impact on cyclists. It held a summation workshop with key stakeholders in this area to present the research outcomes and produced a report which has gained significant coverage in the UK press. They have now secured additional funding to extend the survey and include international aspects.

Paths of Desire: this involves researchers from Lancaster University, Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Kent as well as Lancaster City Council, a digital design company and a fine artist. They are developing a new map application which displays locations based on experiences and interests of users. This unique prototype app is in final development stages and will be developed further by the SME partner.

Additional informal connections have been made and sustained between participants forming the basis of a network of collaborations who continue to discuss shared topics and may enable future working.

Long term impacts of this project include the learning which has been retained within The Creative Exchange both in terms of working practices for the doctoral students and methods taken forward to other ideation and collaboration workshops and events. The tools themselves may also be transferrable to other contexts and we are exploring cross sector opportunities for this.

A key outcome of this was to set a precedent for an exciting and engaging event to bring people together beyond the traditional workshop or conference with stratified hierarchies and less opportunity for broad collaboration.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Creative Lounge tools</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This software was developed to generate unique 3D fingerprint shapes from visitors stories imagined during an exhibition engagement activity.

In this Game Jam we attempted to capture the values of play from our childhood and party games. In order to do this, we created the i-dentity game which was built upon the childhood play of &amp;quot;What time is it, Mr. Wolf&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Sleeping Lions&amp;quot;.

In our game, four players that benefits from being played in front of an audience (Fig. 1). It is played with a set of Sony Move controllers and no screen. Players assume the role of an interrogator or one of three spies. The three spies each hold a Move controller. One Move controller is randomly selected by the game to represent the spies' leader. The leader's movements illuminate all three of the spies' controllers, while the spies' movements are ignored. Vibration feedback is discretely sent to the leader's controller when moved to let him/her know his/her role in the game. The leader's role is only known amongst the spies themselves.

The interrogator, whose goal is to identify the spies' leader, conducts or asks the spies to perform movements. For example, we observed commands such as asking the group to jump up and down, they could be asked to &amp;quot;pretend they had just been shot&amp;quot;, or to play air guitar. However, the interrogator can only address the spies together, as a group (so the interrogator cannot say &amp;quot;only the person in the middle should jump&amp;quot;). While the leader moves through acting out a command, everyone's light turns on. When the leader is stationary the lights go out. The spies copy their movements in an attempt to identify whose movements control the light. The game continues until the interrogator believes she/he knows the identity of the spies' leader. At this stage, the interrogator points towards the leader. The chosen leader waves their controller; if all the spies' controllers illuminate, the interrogator wins and the spies and interrogator switch roles, otherwise the leader and the spies win. Players often agreed upon a limit to the amount of commands that could be asked before requiring the interrogator to select a leader.</gtr:description><gtr:id>FB3D8170-2E1F-4883-88E4-36384903810B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The value of i-dentity has been its use as a digital tool to explore how movement in digital games is represented.

These controllers represent one future of digital game control where the most important thing is the body-space, exercise and social engagement rather than being placed in front of a display and being given a prescriptive game experience.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>i-dentity - Gavin Wood</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/baawolf</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Cold Sun provides an example that illustrates how scientific and real world data can be integrated into game mechanics to enhance the rhetoric of the game by engaging the player at a more personal level.

The exploratory web platform and novel search interface is implemented for Tyne &amp;amp; Wear Archives and Museums' online collections and aims to encourage people to search and discover museum content online.

The seamless designed website invites users to dive into the collection and enables the experience of serendipity while browsing through artefacts. Adapting the users' scrolling speed the interface either keeps displaying related items or presents random new topics. Storing items that have been clicked on the website allows users to go back in their browsing experience. Also, a map view presents all items that are stored and their relations to each other. This feature provides the user with the opportunity to find more related content to collection items and to use this as a starting point for a new search.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C47EA1E0-36A5-4CCA-A987-6DD21654C839</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interface has received over 13,000 visits and has been integrated with the online search system for Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums online collection.

The game resurrects the mythical Wild Man of Belsay who features in the Middleton family's coat of arms. With location beacons hidden around the rooms, the experience is played through visitors' mobile phones, the voice of the Wild Man guiding them through challenges and responding to the players' actions as they explore the old hall.

This app takes users into a different time and place where wild creatures roam the rooms of Belsay Hall, challenging them to creep carefully through the halls to surprise the Wild Man - who listens and feels their every move.

Typically visitors get their information via audio headsets or information boards but these are very isolating and don't encourage people to engage either with each other or their surroundings. The aim of the Wild Man Game is to get people to look beyond the mobile phone and explore their environment in a way they wouldn't otherwise, immersing themselves in the history rather than simply looking at it from a distance.

The players in the game do not have to follow a set route around the house or look at things in a certain order. Instead it is about exploring in your own time and in your own way as the game develops around you.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CE69A3F-76AD-4C4F-8C50-E21716B850B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The augmented reality software from this App have been used in the Labella app which has achieved considerable success in the upcoming CHI 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Wild Man Game</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Following CX discussions with Ben Dalton on digital identity, web browser data and lifetime personal data stores the company Mydex developed and released a browser data plugin for their online Mydex PDS.

We'll show you on a handy map all of the places near you that have been reviewed by other mothers. We've also carefully designed FeedFinder so that it can be used one-handed as much as possible so that you can even be adding a review of a breastfeeding place as you breastfeed your little one.

You can use FeedFinder to find places around you where other mothers have had positive breastfeeding experiences. Every recommended place on the map will have been reviewed by someone who's breastfeeding. You'll be able to see not only how they have rated that place, but also any handy comments that they have added about their experience or the location, like whether they have toys and a menu for toddlers, or where the breastfeeding room is if it's a bit difficult to find.

If you can't find somewhere near you, or have found a new gem be sure to add the new place to the map. You'll find the process easy and convenient with FeedFinder doing most the hard work, like locating the place on the map, or adding the address details - all you'll need to do is add a star rating and your own comments.

FeedFinder is part of a research project based at the Digital Interaction group in Newcastle University, UK. Check out http://feed-finder.co.uk for more details about how we store, collect and use your anonymised data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D56D93E3-77DF-4D12-9C5B-4B02BA14C79C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The FeedFinder application has been widely received within the UK and further afield.

Participants simply connect to a specially designed web page to enable the performers to use their phone as a loudspeaker within the performance.
The specially made system allows for each phone to be controlled individually and for each audience member to hold their own distinctive part of the composition. Up to 300 people can connect simultaneously, the swarm of tiny speakers creates a collection of overlapping sound sources enabling listeners to gain a unique spatial perspective on their shared environment. Each phone also becomes a visual medium, screens flashing from white to black as sound is played. Coupled with the audio this creates an ever changing flickering of light and sound throughout the performance space. This work builds upon the Fields system which we have been implementing since early 2014, this provides the capabilities for network communication and sound diffusion necessary for this type of performance. Fields is released as an open- source program and benefits from a wealth of international performances in venues throughout Europe and the USA.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0A067F75-BB75-4699-9474-0F5613CF85A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fields has been performed in the following venues Cafe OTO (London, UK) ?

Lee Omar, the CEO, describes the impact on the company as follows: &amp;quot;Having direct access to work with a local authority in a paid capacity gave us confidence and credibility, which enabled us to design and develop a solution that enables more visibility for citizens living in urban environments.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Creative Exchange process was fantastic for us as we invested much more of our own time into the project to enable us to produce IP that we could commercialise. The learning of working with the city data sets as part of the Creative Exchange has enabled us to design and develop commercial products with a multinational energy company on a smart energy platform that will enable sustainable urban developments. Commercially this was valuable to us and is worth ten times the financial reward than the Creative Exchange project. This validates the extra work we did on the Creative Exchange project.&amp;quot; Since engaging with Creative Exchange, Red Ninja employs five times as many staff and their turnover has increased six fold. The company is also continuing the collaborative approach to work, sponsoring a programme of PhD students embedded within their practices and developing their own research arm. Additionally, as a direct result of things learned from the Open Planning project, Creative Exchange is funding a new twelve-month collaboration to develop a new platform by which public data (such as that held by city councils) can be held and provided back to relevant parties in a way that can be truly open and beneficial. It will involve working with current data handling companies to develop a new system, with the aim of scaling it across the country. It will initially be trialled in three cities: Manchester, Lancaster and Liverpool.</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://www.redninja.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2011</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:spinOutOutput><gtr:companyName>Made with Glove</gtr:companyName><gtr:description>MadeWithGlove is a UK wearable technology company designing fashionable heated gloves for women.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6F424E60-DC09-4B4A-BA1B-4D063292B6E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Numbers that Matter brought together academics, companies and hackers with an interest in wearables, open data and civic wellbeing. Together they looked at how to design empathy and community into an open hardware product development life cycle. The central concern and motivator for the project and its research approach was civic wellbeing, bringing a new angle to the timely topic of wearable devices and open data, including demographics outside the usual young technology aware user base. There is a lot of data that is about individuals but not a lot of data that is for individuals and their communities. Numbers that Matter aimed to design more meaningful ways of accessing and building with that data - not limited to designing for the tech elite of early adopters and instead responding to the day-to-day needs and concerns of a locality. The Numbers That Matter project held a Hackathon in March 2014. The winner of this hackathon, with financial and business development support from The Creative Exchange, went on to found a startup company Made With Glove developing heated glove wearable devices, and was shortlisted for The Pitch top 100, Britain's biggest small business competition. http://www.thepitch.uk/shortlist/made-withglove-ltd/220. After receiving a &amp;pound;5,000 innovation voucher from Innovate UK to conduct prefeasibility studies, the company founder Michelle Hua is now applying for the SMART funding through Innovate UK and hopes to launch a commercial product during 2016. &amp;quot;Creative Exchange have been very supportive in progressing my idea to prototype stage. While the funding itself was to bring an idea to prototype stage, I have received more than a prototype which has added great value to my business. The value, I believe, has been in making the right connections and meeting the right people to support my business. This is so important in every entrepreneur's journey. I was invited to attend and exhibit my prototype at the Prime Conference at the Royal Institution of Great Britain. I was inspired by all the speakers and made valuable connections with people from the industry. I was also invited to attend the AHRC and Innovate UK meeting in London to discuss ways in which AHRC and Innovate UK can have better relationships and how Innovate UK can better service its customers. We also addressed the challenges of small and micro businesses' access to Innovate UK. Being a startup entrepreneur, it was very interesting learning about the issues of funding from the funder's perspective. I was invited to showcase my prototype at the Innovate UK exhibition at Old Billingsgate in London with over 2000 international delegates, providing me with many opportunities for my business. The support along the way from the team has been invaluable, answering questions in relation to funding, business ideas, models and introducing me to networks of contacts as well as discussing and brainstorming ideas. It has been a positive experience and I am grateful for the support.&amp;quot; Michelle
