These churches have been labelled 'megachurches' for the sake of convenience and are normally defined as: Protestant churches attracting over 2000 attendees for the sake of worship each week. The megachurch phenomenon has been studied extensively in USA, to some extent in Asia (mostly Korea) and Africa (e.g. Nigeria) but only in a very limited sense in Europe (e.g. France). Therefore, it is extremely timely to consider the nature of these churches in the context of a global city such as London during a period of transnational movement and to understand their significance in relation to wider society and especially social engagement.

Therefore, the central aim of this project is to investigate the nature of social engagement among megachurches in London and to interpret the significance of this participation for public theology, elucidating the policy implications for religious faith and society. Examples of social engagement include work with specific groups, such as youth, the elderly and the homeless, counselling and support of people with learning difficulties and mental health needs, community development and educational projects, as well as social campaigning, for example against human trafficking or in favour of local and community needs. The findings of this research will have significance for UK government as well as local government public policy. It is conceived as a project in public theology (i.e. how theology addresses issues of broader public concern outside the community of the church) that will nevertheless use theoretical insights from sociology, cultural studies and social/public policy. Data will be collected from ten case studies that constitute the megachurches of London using qualitative research approaches. This data will be analysed theoretically in relation to transnationalism, globalization, urbanization, religious social capital and theological motivations. The study will examine the nature of these churches, how they interact with different voluntary and statutary bodies and whether they contribute to the common good and if so how and in what ways. These questions are particularly timely during a period of political and economic uncertainty in Europe because such circumstances often feed into the churches' identity, broader worldview and level of social engagement.

The findings from this project will be disseminated through different media: a webpage will be developed to profile the project and inform the general public. This webpage will highlight key information on megachurch social engagement activities, and, later, podcasts from team members and key megachurch figures that explore the public and theological significance of the social engagement activities. Two conferences will be organized, one to launch the project, inviting academics, church leaders, church-based researchers and stakeholders, the Christian media and religion correspondents from mainstream news agencies. A 'Faith and Social Engagement Consultation' will be established in order to share findings through the period of the project and invite participation among representatives from the churches under study and para-church organisations and local and national government policy makers. At the second conference a report will present the main findings and recommendations for policy consideration. Finally, a two-volume co-authored book will be written based on ten case studies, contributing to the public theology debate about faith and the public sphere and in particular the role of megachurch social engagement.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A number of different groups will benefit from this research.

Civic Leaders in society will benefit from this research because it will inform them about a significant and very visible group of churches that are already exerting considerable influence in the capital city. They will become better informed and thus able to make better decisions for the constituencies they represent on matters of faith and society.They will be able to better appreciate the role that religion plays in the lives of many citizens, its cultural contexts and in what ways religion can both enhance quality of life and also be detrimental to quality of life. The consultation process will invite them to participate in discussions, thus developing their own understanding directly, and the project report will summarise the findings in an easily digested form in order to inform their decision-making.

More specifically, political and social policy makers, both at local and national levels, will better appreciate how megachurch religion is a social force of considerable significance, which might be harnessed for the civic good. In many cases, faith-based organizations provide various services in the areas of social care, education and health, but it is not always entirely clear just how these services complement existing public services. This research will provide data for public service providers in order to assist them in the evaluation of their own provision and how it can be improved in the light of emerging evidence from the faith-based sector. The project report will make recommendations as to how this information can be translated into concrete action for the sake of enhancing exisiting practice and provision, and to address areas of weakness in policy and practice.

Megachurch leaders and megachurches themselves will benefit from this research because they will able to appreciate the nature of the social engagement across the range of the different churches. The process of consultation, meetings and conferences will provide a series of networking opportunities, allowing them to appreciate themselves as belonging to a web of interconnected religious and social groups cooperating in the public square. These networking opportunities will allow them to meet and develop professional working relationships with other community and political stakeholders. The website resources will provide them with key information, thus developing their own understandings and practices.The final project report will make recommendations to megachurch leaders regarding their own practice of social engagement.

Wider Christian organizations, Thinktanks and Networks will benefit from this research because they will be able to appreciate the nature and significance of megachurches directly and in detail. Again through the networking opportunities they will be able to establish professional working relationships. The final report will make recommendations as to how wider Christian organizations might better cooperate with megachurches to enhance social engagement on all sides.

An accessible Handbook will be written for leaders of large (but not mega) Churches based on the lesson learned from this research. It will provide a resource for large churches to enhance or develop their own practices of social engagement.

The wider public will also benefit from knowledge about megachurches in order to make informed choices about how to respond to them in their own contexts. They can contribute to the discussion by means of the online material, which will also provide useful resources for classroom use at School as well as University level. 

The wider academic public beyond the specialist audience of the researchers will benefit from the knowledge generated from this research through the two-volume book, the journal articles, conference papers, as well as the online material found in the webpage.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>574511</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> 'Alternative public theologies and their implications for social policy and practice' - Mark Cartledge and Heather Buckingham, presentation given at Megachurches and Social Engagement in London Day Conference at Royal Geographical Society, London on Tuesday 1st November 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>71A380D6-EF3A-4274-BABF-6B85D924DAB7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'Alternative public theologies and their implications for social policy and practice' - Mark Cartledge and Heather Buckingham, presentation given at Megachurches and Social Engagement in London Day Conference at Royal Geographical Society, London on Tuesday 1st November 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>What good are London's mega churches?</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C80AB0FA-8B9F-41B5-A792-3E71D79FC897</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog post from Andrew Davies on the Theos Team Blog which was retweeted and cited quite extensively at the time.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theosthinktank.co.uk/comment/2016/11/01/what-good-are-londons-mega-churches</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Faith and Social Engagement Forum 3</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1EF70518-2BB9-46E3-BE57-3660C3821A1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Approximately 20 policymakers, politicians and representatives of NGOs attended an evening presentation or dialogue on the theme of youth and education.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Stakeholder Conversation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A97366EC-5A1D-4153-A6AC-3267D9093D07</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Stakeholder Conversation brought together professionals from churches, NGOs and Think Tanks to discuss the nature of the project, share some very preliminary findings towards the end of the first year of research and initiate a conversation on the subject of megachurches, public theology and social policy.

All of the delegates asked to be kept informed of the developments in the project and were very interested to understand how they might contribute to further analysis of our findings. There was a lot of interest around more popular publication of the research findings and how leaders and members of smaller churches might apply examples of good practice found among the megachuches. Overall it was a very fruitful conversation and I am very pleased that we organised the event in London.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Faith and Social Engagement Forum 2</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E82F0504-8D5C-4D7A-B85B-86693762E90E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A special event focused on Young People, Social Aspiration &amp;amp; Innovation, Education, including presentations from the project team and speakers and participants including Theresa Esan MBE from Kingsway International Christian Centre, who runs their 'Breaking Educational Barriers' project &amp;amp; Mike Royal, Director of TLG The Education Charity .

We held a series of 'Faith and Social Engagement Forums' with practitioners, NGO, policy and political representatives to discuss our findings with them and compare them to their context.

2. We released a 'Megachurches and Social Engagement: Policy Options and Opportunities' policy briefing which was circulated to about 50 parliamentarians, plus officials in DLCG, third sector organisations, practitioners, church leaders, political representatives, mayor of London's office.

3. We held a briefing meeting to release the policy document which was attended by and reported extensively in the press.

We have had responses from a number of ministers and MPs, most prominently from John Glenn MP:

&amp;quot;The report bears out what I take to be the 'hidden' reality of Christianity in the UK - a number of growing, vibrant, socially-engaged churches that it is difficult to see behind the figures on Sunday attendance. When I was PPS at DCLG there was some recognition of this - especially in traditionally strong areas like homelessness - but always some level of discomfort with civil servants about the link between evangelism and social action. Whilst you suggest that there is still a distinction between the two, it is very helpful to have some rigorous work to show how it's actually theological commitments that drive socially engaged projects in churches - so the pretence that the UK could get all of the 'social' benefits with none of the 'religious' baggage becomes increasingly untenable.&amp;quot;

and Dame Caroline Spelman MP (and Church Commissioner) reported that she had found the report very useful and expected to refer to it in future to inform policy decisions.

4. We were asked to a meeting with officials at the DLCG about our research and also at the Mayor of London's office (both have yet to take place).

5. Our work was extensively covered in blog postings from the Evangelical Alliance and Theos Think Tank, and was covered in the Catholic Herald and Christian Today.

6. Our work is leading to collaboration with the Conservative Christian Fellowship and others on the concept of social justice from the Centre Right perspective.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7D8ACC63-905D-4562-B7EC-46D0165A02FD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We concluded:

A. For the megachurches and many other large and growing British churches, Christianity is about relationship with god and is not reducible to a set of beliefs, rituals or values or to a historic institutional culture.

B. Churches' social engagement activities place a far stronger emphasis on interpersonal relationships than on proselytization or evangelism.

C. The churches' social engagement should not be understood only in terms of services or activities they offer for those who are not part of their congregations (i.e., they also offer important services to their own attenders which are of considerable value).

D. The megachurches differed greatly in what they considered social engagement to be and how they went about doing it.

E. Most activities are resourced primarily by volunteers and voluntary giving, although in many cases paid staff play an important part in leading and overseeing them.

Our main academic publication (the book) is still outstanding and will be delivered to the publisher later this year. We are also still completing the Churches' Handbook on Social Engagement which will be released later this year too.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Other researchers could certainly develop the investigation of how churches provide social-type services. In particular they could explore how churches with less human resources can engage with social need when motivated by their faith to do so. In particular they could explore how smaller churches need to collaborate more extensively and how it is configured and with whom. Other religious traditions could be usefully explored in these terms as well.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ED7A5E9D-2FA0-455D-88CB-DAF5AD62899C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and
