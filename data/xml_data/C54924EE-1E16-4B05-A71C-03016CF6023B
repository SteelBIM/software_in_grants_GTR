These negotiations are framed by a Law on the Right to Prior Consultation, passed in 2011 under a newly elected government, which answers the internationally legislated right of indigenous peoples to be consulted on matters regarding the industrial development of their land, particularly where extraction of natural resources is at stake. The implementation of the principle of prior consultation in a multilingual and multicultural country like Peru, where Amerindian languages belonging to some 16 language families are spoken in addition to the majority language, Spanish, raises problems of communication across language and cultural boundaries, which are being addressed by a number of means. Under the terms of the Law on Prior Consultation adherence must be made to the Law of Language Rights (also passed in 2011), whereby the state must provide translators and interpreters to transmit the message of the Law and to mediate the consultations across cultural boundaries. The text of the Prior Consultation law has been translated into five indigenous languages, and more translations are being prepared. The state, under the aegis of the Viceministry of Interculturality (also created in 2011), is delivering an interpreter training programme from which more than a hundred bilingual speakers of Spanish with some twenty Amerindian languages between them have already graduated and are being contracted to work on the consultation sessions as they arise. This convergence in Peruvian social policy of concern with language rights of indigenous peoples and the right to prior consultation, brings together the spheres of law, health and the environment, in a way that creates new challenges for the state, as well as for the non-governmental organisations working in close contact with the rural populations around issues of equality. With the proposed project the investigators (two from the UK and one from Peru), take an interdisciplinary approach to researching the textual products (translations of the Law) and the social, cultural and linguistic processes (interpreter training and practice) that are emerging in this new conjuncture. To keep the scope manageable, we shall focus on translation of the text of the Law into four languages, two of the highlands (Quechua and Aymara) and two of Amazonia (Ash&amp;aacute;ninka and Achuar); we shall be assisted in the task by bilingual consultants with linguistic training and experience of translation. We shall bring the tools of anthropological linguistics, Translation and Interpreting Studies, and sociolinguistics of Peruvian indigenous languages, to bear in addressing the overarching question: to what extent is translation and interpreting in contexts of mediation between the state and the indigenous communities in Peru achieving its ostensive aim of greater equality of treatment, contributing to more harmonious relations between state and indigenous populations in a hierarchical postcolonial society, while allowing sustainable economic development to take place in conditions satisfactory to all sides? To come close to the contexts in which the processes are taking place, we shall work with two Project Partners (a government ministry and a non-governmental organisation with access to the indigenous communities). We shall apply a mixed-method approach to data collection and analysis, using ELAN software to assist processing. We shall disseminate results through workshops and symposia in Peru and in the UK, as well as via a dedicated Project website and publications in academic journals. We shall ensure impact in Peru through public events in the regions where the consultations are taking place (Cuzco and Iquitos).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project engages with social issues that are a prominent field of public concern in Peru at the current time. The results of this research will also be of interest, and potential impact, in the wider world where matters of environmental protection, indigenous rights, and communicative rights come together. A number of activities and public relations events will generate impact, as follows:
(1) Workshops and public meetings. Co-I facilitated Workshop in Peru for professional and trainee interpreters, hosted by Project Partner Viceministry for Interculturality. The PI facilitated workshop for development project workers on multilingualism, language rights and language ideologies in Peru's new legislative conjuncture, hosted by Project Partner SER (Servicios Educativos Rurales). Workshops open to wide audiences from diverse sectors as relevant: government (Ministries of Education and Culture), multicultural education (NGOs such as TAREA), rural development (SER), and biodiversity protection (NGOs such as Instituto del Bien Comun). Public meetings organised with indigenous organisation representatives and community authorities, and local government as appropriate, in the regions where we shall conduct the fieldwork (Cuzco and Iquitos): these will be for giving information, raising awareness, and gathering opinion with audiences. In the UK, at Newcastle and Heriot Watt, we shall convene Project Seminars to which we shall invite a cross-section of students, academics and public service workers interested in different aspects of the research: legislated mediation of minority rights, public health and environmental protection in developing countries, intercultural communication and language rights. Details of these seminars are given under Academic Beneficiaries. 
(2) Information dissemination. Information on the aims, development and results of the project will be disseminated via a number of media: TV and radio news channel exposure in Lima and in the regions where the consultation sessions will be observed (Cuzco and Iquitos); publication of a project flyer containing text in indigenous languages as well as Spanish (est. print-run 1000 copies) for distribution at public meetings; Project website with interactive blog; Project development reports for electronic distribution and discussion internally with Project Partner organisations. 
(3) Knowledge exchange. Knowledge exchange with Project Partners and members of the relevant communities of practice will facilitate discussion about key aspects of translation and interpreting practice: ethics in translating and interpreting; the difference between interpreters and intercultural mediators, and how this is manifested in Peru; the influence of bilingualism on the interpretation/translation process; sociological issues that affect interpreter training in Peru, related to inequality of educational opportunity, ethnic identity, and economic factors; discussion about interpreter codes of practice and guidelines.
Non-academic users of our research
Our principle non-academic research users will be Project Partner Viceministry of Interculturality within the Ministry of Culture, in particular its Department of Indigenous Languages and Department of Rights of Indigenous Peoples; Project Partner SER; civil society organisations such as the Defensoria del Pueblo (Ombudsman) with its office for Environment, Public Services and Indigenous Peoples headed by Alicia Abanto; indigenous organisations such as the Interethnic Association for the Development of the Peruvian Rainforest (AIDESEP) and CARE (Central Ashaninka Rio Ene) with whom we have contact through Ashaninka education specialist Caleb Cabello, a participant in a previous project of the PI; we shall communicate our results and discuss with other Amazonian indigenous and highland peasant (campesino) organisations through our relationship with our Project Partners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162981</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Pontifical Catholic University of Peru</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Peru, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pontificia Universidad Cat&amp;oacute;lica del Per&amp;uacute; (PUCP)</gtr:description><gtr:id>58CC2D6F-5AA4-4F75-867E-C26B1C20FACF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications in preparation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>PUCP releases the International Co-I Luis Andrade from other duties in order to conduct data collection, help to coordinate and take part in public engagement events, attend consultancy meetings, and write up results.

A large proportion of the audience was familiar with other aspects of the Prior Consultation processes (e.g. political, environmental, legal), but not about the intricacies of the interpreters' role in such processes.

The bid was timely, motivated by the fact that the Indigenous Languages Division in Peru had recently approached the PI for informal advice on the shaping of language policy for indigenous people in Peru. This timeliness bodes well for impact, now that the project has been successfully completed. We can expect impact to be ongoing over the next few years, becoming more evident once our results are more widely disseminated in published outputs. We can highlight some of the actions of our research already generating impact, and likely to generate it further in the medium term. (i) Our participation in the 8th Training Course in Translating and Interpreting in Indigenous Languages (August 17-Sept 4, 2015) led to our providing the Indigenous Languages Division (Ministry of Culture) team with a written report on our observations and recommendations for future changes to the training course content and mode of delivery (this report is an Appendix to the Project Final Report described in the Influence on Policy section). (ii) Raquel de Pedro was consulted by the Indigenous Languages Division on the draft Protocol for Indigenous Translators and Interpreters in Public Services. Once the Protocol is implemented, it is envisaged that the provision of language services will be strengthened, thus resulting in improvements in the access to health, justice and education structures for the millions of speakers of indigenous languages in Peru. Our research will have fed into these improvements. (iii) The panel discussion of the International Translators' Forum (FIT) in Lima, Sept. 2015, in which Raquel de Pedro participated, was highlighted in the FIT's press release, to quote: Of particular interest was the Roundtable on legal translation and court interpreting for indigenous languages - the first and timely gathering of this nature for all stakeholders, unquote; (http://www.fit-ift.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FOROFIT-Press-Release_EN.pdf). We will build on this experience with further public engagement events before the project end date, and expect impact to follow. (iv) The research is also beginning to have an impact beyond the audiences belonging to the ambit of the state training and language rights promotion activities, for example among indigenous women&amp;acute;s organisations with whom our other project partners (Servicios Educativos Rurales - SER) work. We flag this up as an area for future research in the Key Findings section.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>057B96E2-3A16-4FAE-8665-EB00B1A6F803</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) We discovered that the process of training translators and interpreters between Spanish and the indigenous languages of Peru has more complex levels of significance than we had previously anticipated, in so far as the indigenous trainees and the agents of the state working on behalf of indigenous rights, alike, have an active interest in promoting the cause of language rights, in addition to and beyond the need to train in the technical and cultural skills required of professional translators and interpreters. In sum, we found out the many ways in which translation and interpreting between Spanish and the indigenous languages raises complex linguistic, social and political issues that do not manifest themselves in the field of mainstream T&amp;amp;I practices. Many trainees, in addition to obtaining professional accreditation, were keen to maximise the potential for indigenous empowerment that the training context offered them. Our research also revealed new dimensions of the ways in which indigenous identity is lived and constructed in Andean and Amazonian societies. We explore these findings in our submission to the journal Indiana, particularly. 
(2) In terms of the translation of the language of the law into the indigenous languages, which we also proposed to examine, we focused on the translation of the Languages Act rather than the translation of the Prior Consultation Act as originally planned. This was due to the fact that translation of the Languages Act proved to have advanced across a much wider range of languages, had been conducted more systematically, and was a direct upshot of the translation training courses. Methodologically, the translations of the Languages Act thus provided us with a body of work that was easier to study in a comparative framework. We limited textual analysis to five languages: Central Peruvian Quechua, Southern Peruvian Quechua, Aymara, Ashaninka and Shipibo. Our analysis revealed the difficulties posed by the process of translation of a legal text written in Spanish into the indigenous languages, not only due to the lack of lexical equivalents to express many of the concepts expressed in the source text, but also due to the receiving languages belonging to a tradition of orality with no equivalent of the legal genre. Our study identifies the translation strategies adopted, and the potential for some degree of cultural appropriation of the message on the part of the indigenous translators who undertake the task. We explore these findings in our submissions to the journals Amerindia and Meta.
(3) Our work on interpreting between Spanish and the indigenous languages in prior consultation settings (consultation with the indigenous communities by the state prior to the latter authorising extractive industrial activity on community land) revealed the extent to which the role of the interpreter in such sensitive contexts needed to be further defined by those involved in its implementation. The distinction to be made between interpretation and cultural mediation was seen to need further definition in practice. Prior consultation as legislated for in Peru proved to be a uniquely Latin American context for the use of interpreting services. Our study of this process was highly original in this respect. We discovered how the interpreters' role in prior consultation in fact straddles the provision of a public service and the type of mediation required in business negotiations. This ambivalence results in a clash of the traditional codes of practice for each (impartiality in the case of the former and positioning in the case of the latter, albeit within the parameters of accuracy and completeness expected in both scenarios). This blend of two potentially competing sets of interests is a phenomenon which may compromise the interpreters' position in the exchanges. This is an area in which we were able to provide recommendations Through consultation provided verbally and in writing to our project partners, the DLI, as well as dissemination of our research findings through published outlets, we expect that there will be a raising of awareness of these issues, so that professional guidelines can be implemented and their observance can be monitored in an effective manner. This should result both in safeguards for the interpreters and quality assurance for the primary participants in Prior Consultation processes (the state and the indigenous communities). These findings are explored in our submission to the journal Target. 
4) Our research attracted the attention of the editors of a special issue of the International Journal of the Sociology of Language, on Translation Policy and Minority Languages; we have an article forthcoming with them that presents the issue of translation policy in Peru as related to the country's new legislation on Language Rights, and in regional perspective, comparing the incipient nature of state translation policy in Peru with that of Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Bolivia. We anticipate that this study will be of interest to our project partners, from a policy making perspective.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>(i) Our results can be useful to policy-makers in the fields of language policy and indigenous rights, in order better to understand the role and mode of operation of indigenous language interpreters in a country like Peru where the legacy of colonisation still sours levels of understanding between the state (many of whose representatives are Spanish monolingual) and the indigenous organisations and communities. We submitted a Project Final Report to the Ministry of Culture in November 2016 that included a set of recommendations intended to inform governmental processes and practices related to the training and certification of indigenous translators and interpreters, as well as the provision of their services. The Indigenous Languages Division (our Project Partners and the Ministerial department responsible for training) can put these recommendations to use and we have evidence that they have started to do so. Fuller detail of this report can be found in the 'Influence on Policy' section of this submission. 
Throughout the project, we provided input into the drafting and revision of relevant policy documents, such as:
? The Protocol for Public Service and Mass Media Translation and Interpreting in Indigenous Languages (&amp;quot;Protocolo para la traducci&amp;oacute;n e interpretaci&amp;oacute;n de lenguas ind&amp;iacute;genas para servicios p&amp;uacute;blicos o productos comunicacionales masivos&amp;quot;)
? The Directive Concerning the Operation of the National Register of Indigenous Translators and Interpreters (&amp;quot;Directiva sobre el funcionamiento del Registro Nacional&amp;quot;)
? The Regulation of the Indigenous Languages Act (&amp;quot;Reglamentaci&amp;oacute;n de la Ley de Lenguas&amp;quot;)
Our input here had influence, and can be expected eventually to have impact. 
(ii) In the academic field, our results could be taken forward and deepened in three fields of further research: (a) The cultural activism developed by the trainees; (b) The complexities of translation between indigenous languages, and Spanish, (c) The complexities of interpretation between indigenous languages and Spanish.
(a) In the field of indigenous activism, we identify three areas for future research, which we observed in the course of the project but which went beyond our proposed objectives:
- The presence of '[female] social translators' (traductoras sociales), indigenous women who work as ad hoc community translators and interpreters, without any formal training. 
- Digital activism in support of indigenous languages, based on social networking platforms such as Facebook and blogs, a phenomenon which is gaining ground among the trained translator-interpreters. 
- The existence of purist language ideologies among Amazonian trainees, associated with the incipient use of writing among Amazonian groups; such ideologies have been previously studied in the Andean region, but are not well known about for Amazonia.
(b) In the field of translation between Spanish and the indigenous languages, our project results could be deepened in the following aspects:
- The systematic study of the reception of the translations of the Languages Act into the indigenous languages, according to social variables of gender, age, and level of formal education
- A more extensive study of the strategies and sociocultural experience of translation (in both directions) across different contexts of translation practice, for example that of Amazonian people involved in Bible translation for missionaries in the mid- to late twentieth century, and that of Andean academics involved in ethnographic and literary translation up until the present day. 
- Our project focused on legal translation in one direction only, from Spanish into five indigenous languages, highlighting the problem of lack of 'equivalences' (as discussed in our article for Amerindia). There would be interest among speakers in a follow up study that focuses on the expression of moral values and customary law in the indigenous languages, and how, working in the other direction, these might be expressed in Spanish. 
(c) In the field of interpretation between the indigenous languages and Spanish, findings could be broadened in the following directions:
- Ethnographic study of interpretation in prior consultation settings, a task currently impeded by the restrictions placed on researchers being able to observe these processes. 
- The experience of legal interpreting in courts of law, building upon what we learned of the experiences of interpreters involved in a particular trial taking place in northern Peru (Bagua) during the period of the project.
- A comparison between contemporary interpreting strategies and experience and the colonial historical record (to be gleaned in archives) would be of academic interest in a number of disciplines.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>149449D8-EFB8-4552-BEDB-9E05605EB442</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://research.ncl.ac.uk/translatingculturesperu/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Project Final Report in Spanish for circulation within the Viceministry of Interculturality, Ministry of Culture, Peru, and eventual publication by them. 27 pages plus 3 Appendices (95 pages)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>South America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A88DD1C0-45B7-4B31-97F6-E9652C9B6E81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The recommendations in this Project Final Report, constitute areas in which impact is beginning or is likely to begin in the short to medium term, and include:
