It will be written simply, for the general reader; but should also interest specialists, since it will use Czech and Slovak archival material (including the entire post-war Czechoslovak secret police archive) which has not been consulted before, and which points to radical reinterpretations of even such well-known topics as the Munich Crisis and Prague Spring. Drawing on a wide range of sources, the book will seek to avoid Czech-centeredness, balancing the often sharply differing perceptions of the peoples who made up Czechoslovakia. As a close study of a state which, although it lasted only 74 years, experienced democracy, fascism and communism, The Czechoslovak Experiment, 1918-1992 should offer a valuable corrective to the great-power perspectives which underpin current interpretations of twentieth-century Europe.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27257</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Expert Panel (Prague Writers Festival in Pittsburgh)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3E44F139-9BC9-40F7-AB51-8B3FAD89CF7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk sparked discussion and questions; was covered by ABC news, Associated Press, Time, ?esk? televize 1, ?esk? televize 24 as well as local press (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, etc).

The entire 2-hour discussion, including questions, was shown live on Czech Television, and remains available to watch via iplayer on Czech Television 24. The event was followed by press coverage and internet discussion. Discussion was sparked in the Senate, the press, on blogs and websites and in people's homes.

The book's research findings, which challenge the former Czechoslovak state's reputation for liberal, democratic values and the decent treatment of its minorities, are changing public perceptions of the Czechoslovak past. These are gradually being absorbed and accepted. As Petr Pithart, former Czech Prime Minister, concluded his talk in the Czech Senate: 'Your book has helped by sparking our conscience... I believe that your book will contribute to a certain cleansing of the atmosphere in this country. But it's going to be painful.' Questions from the floor and press coverage afterwards suggest the same shift from an initially hostile press reception to a much more accepting and understanding one.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/kultura/223138-diskuse-z-festivalu-spisovatelu-zrozeni-a-smrt-ceskoslovenska</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lecture (Slovak Embassy)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>22FC17D8-5548-4577-81C8-82D3A0C74E79</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sparked discussion and questions from a live audience of several hundred at the Slovak Embassy; was reported and discussed in a variety of Czech and Slovak blogs and newsletters, including the Czech Chamber of Commerce, Czech Centre in London, Friends of Czech Buildings, Parks and Monuments etc

The talk was reported in Czech and Slovak embassy newsletters and blogs and picked up by Czech commercial and business blogs. It also led to my being asked to give the same talk to a public audience of about 100 Czech and Slovak emigres in Edinburgh, which I did in April 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://london.czechcentres.cz/programme/travel-events/czechoslovak-on-history-rough-seas-around-bohemia-/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prague Writers' Festival (one of 7 writers featured at)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9189FFD9-3EC4-48DD-9EA5-A0039E98EDA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Daily discussed impacts of my research findings/book with hundreds of festival-goers; autographed books; substantial media coverage; press, radio and TV interviews.
