It can be used to assess, cross-reference and filter site data and its outputs can be used to produce site investigation and technical feasibility reports. As such it is useful to a range of geo-environmental professionals and we believe the software has significant commercial potential. It may be particularly useful to small-scale projects that currently lack access to purpose-built digital tools owing to their high cost and complexity.

At the moment a free-to-use version of the software is available to download from the BGS website and has achieved well over 1000 unique downloads with no deliberate marketing effort. However, to make the software commercially viable it requires refinement to meet the exacting needs of the market, and a proper commercial plan that will back it up with the support plans, tutorials, documentation and so forth that are required by a commercial customer.

Commercialization would enable us to get the return on investment needed to ensure ongoing development of the product whilst equipping an army of small project teams in the public and private sectors with purpose-built geo-environmental software that is both simple to use and cost-effective at their scale of use. This will help them to grown their own businesses in the competitive domestic and international marketplace whilst enhancing the UK's reputation as a world-class provider of environmental and engineering consultancy services. To this end we would like to commission a market research exercise to (1) assess and confirm the nature of the market, and (2) identify potential routes to market (re-sellers).

The first thing we want insight on is the nature of the market to ensure it exists, estimate its size, and to enable us to target our product development roadmap and marketing efforts. From various networking efforts and collaborative projects we have anecdotal evidence that the software is most relevant to smaller consultancy firms and smaller projects within larger firms, owing to their lack of resources and trained CAD operators. This project will undertake the necessary research to confirm this by commissioning an independent market analysis report.

We are also currently unclear on the most appropriate options for taking our product to market. While we could distribute the software directly there may be better options which ease the administrative burden of the software development team and provide commercial opportunities for the UK software re-seller industry. We would like to commission the necessary research to identify potential commercial partners and distributors within the UK to inform an assessment of our distribution options.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Undertaking the appropriate market research at the earliest possible stage will help us to better align our product with the market. By making our software available commercially we will be offering a viable, easy-to-use option to this market at a reasonable cost and with the reputation of BGS behind it as reassurance of the long-term stability of the product. This will enable smaller project teams to work digitally, gain better insight into their data and produce higher-quality reports in less time. The benefits will be higher quality data insight and reporting on smaller projects, leading to lower financial and environmental risk/costs across the project. Access to purpose-built software tools will enable smaller consultancies to bid into higher status projects and grow their business, both in the domestic and international markets, and the return on investment back to the software team will underpin our ongoing software research and development work, thus contributing to development of UK IPR. Should we identify the best route to market as being via a commercial distribution partner the commercialization will also generate a wider benefit for the UK software industry.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>11851</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/R004854/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>97FC8337-8E84-46A6-ACF2-A6047DA8C582</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>60</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4A635FDF-4DC1-48AB-A010-04619A0042EF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Assess/Remediate Contamination</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DEEA5CB1-59E6-4D82-92D6-DB74E180E6F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth Engineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EDE0586F-810A-4956-BC26-74CA0D6759F6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Hydrogeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
