Irregular immigrants and control policies in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K005359/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This project will provide an explanation as to why, in the UK, despite increasingly strict immigration policies and continuously enhanced law enforcement politics (entry screening, ID and work permits checks, workplace and other raids, and employer sanctions etc.) irregular migration continues. This study specifically aims to uncover aspects that have received little academic attention, namely immigration enforcement, its impact and its limits.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The overarching theme of this study is to examine the impact of increasingly rigid legislation and robust enforcement measures on irregular migration. It aims to find if and how irregular immigrants navigate controls, to investigate the interaction between irregular immigrants' strategies, employer practices and enforcement measures, to show how enforcement measures are perceived by immigrant communities, to explore the impact of enforcement on IMs' access to fundamental rights, to understand the political, practical and ethical limits to law enforcement in order to highlight the impact and effectiveness of enforcement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is a qualitative, multi-dimensional, multi-sited (London, another city and a rural area), multi-actor (four immigrant groups, NGOs and statutory agencies) and mixed-methods (interviews, observations, policy analysis) study. Findings will be compared with studies conducted in 1998 and 2002, thus the study involves an element of serial research.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project aims to offer new evidence in order to improve understanding, communication and policy making in the field of irregular immigration, immigration law enforcement and fundamental rights. The project will build effective reciprocal and on-going academic-stakeholder relationships, from the research design stage, through to research and subsequent dissemination. Thus, a wide range of users will be involved in the design of the research, regularly updated and benefit from new evidence provided by this project.

First, national STATUTORY AGENCIES, such as the Home Office, UK Border Agency and Department for Work and Pensions, police, local governments, service providers and central government will find this project of benefit. Our research will provide a set of analyses, new evidence, and detailed insights that are not normally accessible by or shared between these agencies. For instance, actors involved in enforcement will gain analysis of the effectiveness, impacts and limits of current measures in order for them to be better informed of the wider picture that will be useful for future policy development. Local governments will be able to better understand issues to do with irregular immigrants in their constituency and shall be supported in identifying the policy implications. Department for Work and Pensions will be given analyses focussed on irregular immigrant workers. Thus, this research aims at aiding policy design, offering standard as well as alternative perspectives. Research results could optimise operations in the view of sensitive enforcement. Research results would also provide advice to principal policy-makers and police officers alike.

Second, the national VOLUNTARY SECTOR in the field of (a) Black, ethnic minority, and migrants and refugee support organisations; (b) human rights/fundamental rights organisations; (c) trade unions, (d) trades councils and employers' associations, and (e) other interest groups will be able to better understand the polices and policy options in this sensitive field in order to shape their responses and interventions. They would also gain information about the position of some of their clients and the needs of this client groups, so that better services and advice can be offered and the situation of the client group improved. Finally, we will discuss with them the impact that immigration enforcement has on immigrant communities in order to make suggestions as to ways of increasing the visibility of community views and concerns at a policy level.

Third, this study, because it is unique, will be of benefit to EU bodies, EU and other national law enforcement agencies, INTERGOVERNMETAL ORGANISATIONS, such as IOM, OECD, and ICMPD and INTERNATIONAL NGOs, like ECRE, PICUM and many others. It shall help to formulate and improve policies in this arena.

Fourth, the GENERAL PUBLIC will be informed through press releases to the media, as well as utilising social media channels such as facebook and a blog in order to activate a non-specialist discussion on this topic.

All users will be approached using targeted DISSEMINATION efforts. A key tool in our strategy will be plain English research and policy briefings of which some will be tailor-made for specific user groups. Progress and results will, within limits, be disseminated through a newsletter and reports made accessible on the project website. Furthermore, INDIVIDUAL MEETINGS will be offered to users at various stages of the project (beginning, in-between and end) to discuss research, findings and its implications, to gain additional feedback, ensure relevance and strengthen the impact of the research and consolidate and extend our user relationships and networks.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>487056</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview to Voice of Russia, 5/9/2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BF07AFE-673D-4880-995E-7E91BBAE08FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wide international audience listened to interview

During the first year the team conducted the desk research, some policy field analysis and prepared the conceptual and analytically framework of the project. During the second year, we conducted and finalised almost all fieldwork. Work in the third year was put on hold due to the maternity leave of one of senior researchers. Still, the analysis will only be conducted in the remaining year. Therefore, beyond ad hoc observations we did not yet generate systematic analysis, apart from four project papers, two conference papers and one blog. Nevertheless, our project has already raised considerable attention by the media and by other stakeholders. We have providing expertise to British and international media and provided input to stakeholder events (workshops) by the Home Office, NGOs and other research consortia. We also reviewed and added to the revision of an International Organization for Migration report to the European Commission and attended several meeting of the Brussels-based umbrella organisation Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) and contributed to shaping the organisation's policy.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5AE71D35-66EE-4D7A-8E13-F0081052CC7E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>As in previous projects access to the field meaning to irregular immigrants in the UK as well as to diverse state and non-state stakeholders had been managed successfully.

The project conducted 175 interviews with immigrants from five countries (Australia, Brazil, Turkey, Pakistan, and Ukraine) at urban and rural sites across the country. However, we noticed that some of the research groups were more cautious, notably in sites outside London, and thus more difficult to reach than others whilst certain groups were extremely difficult to identify. There were differences between groups, between sites but also between research conducted in 1998, when informants were generally less concerned and in 2016. For these reasons, research faced more obstacles and took longer than expected and also longer during the comparative project in the late 1990s. However, we met our targets and were thus successful with respect to the empirical research.

We also interviewed five policy makers, 29 representatives of enforcement agencies (Immigration enforcement, police), 20 public services representatives, 21 members from civil society and two from the private sector, 81 in total. We were also able to gain approval for conducting several days of observations of different types of immigration enforcement operations. In addition, we interviewed 20 employers of immigrants. Access to the field of immigration enforcement - a key prerequisite for the success of the project - proved to be feasible and the respective agencies even appeared to be more open than in the late 1990s.

Conventionally, research on irregular migration, apart from the project conducted by the PI (Duvell and Jordan) in 1998, focusses on the irregular immigrants themselves, like their strategies, perspectives and experiences. This project is thus unique as it gained access to enforcement agencies - the immigration service and the police - and conduct interviews and observations. This will enable us to better understand the interaction between the two key actors and thus go significantly beyond state of the art.

So far we have made three key observations. (1) Public and media perception has not only changed fundamentally from the late 1990s but now also has a stronger impact on shaping policy agendas and even politics, as our interviews with enforcement officers suggest. (2) Since the late 1990s, immigration enforcement in the UK has undergone major reforms and thus changed significantly over time; it has achieved higher levels of professionalism, has significantly higher resources, and conducts significantly more activities and operations. However, matters are rather dynamic, whilst the financial resources and organisational equipment peaked in the late 2000s this has been diminishing again due to austerity policy and budget cuts. This lead to significant strategic adjustment away from enforcement to increasing compliance and thus prevention. (3) Irregular immigrants continue to reside and work in the UK and can be found in many parts of the country. Unverified estimates suggest that despite enhanced enforcement numbers have even been increasing whilst they have largely moved out of larger industries or sites into small businesses or self-employment. Different nationalities and indeed ethnicities respond differently to the deterrence of immigration enforcement and detection; however, the deterrent effect still appears to be limited and no few informants were relatively relaxed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Too early to say</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9BE180CE-1958-4BE3-97C6-3C0752967191</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.compas.ox.ac.uk/project/does-immigration-enforcement-matter-diem/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice provided to author of report by IOM to EC DG SANTE</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D1E20340-1124-4C38-A4FE-0BE3BE3BC606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The information I provided went into the report to IOM and DG SANTE, improved its quality and contributed to guidelines on health care for migrants and irregular migrants.
