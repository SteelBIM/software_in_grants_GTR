Previous research suggests that alcohol intoxication narrows attention, thereby making people more responsive to the most central and emotionally salient elements of a situation. In sexual assault, the culprit?s physical appearance and actions are the most emotionally salient aspects of the situation. Other aspects - such as the presence of bystanders and the physical environment, are considered peripheral because they capture less of the victim?s attention.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this research, female participants will be given different doses of alcohol and then will read a sexual assault scenario. 24 hours later their memory for the scenario will be tested. The memories of participants who were given different doses of alcohol will be examined to see if they differ in terms of their accuracy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will also examine whether participants who were under the influence of alcohol whilst reading the scenario are more susceptible to memory distortion. The results will provide essential knowledge for establishing best practice guidelines for interviewing witnesses who were intoxicated. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A staggering number of crimes involve alcohol. Sexual assault is especially likely to involve victims and perpetrators who are under the influence. One problem the legal system faces in handling these cases is ascertaining whether victims can remember essential information. Legal officials commonly feel the following concern, which was shared by a detective: 

&amp;quot;Intoxicated victims. Advocates and SANEs [Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners] get frustrated when we can't move forward with an investigation, but sometimes we can't because the victim doesn't remember what happened or there are inconsistencies [in her story].&amp;quot; 

Given that alcohol is often antecedent to sexual assault--and that about only 1 in 10 cases reported to the police in the UK result in a conviction--it is important to study the relationship between alcohol intoxication and memory for sexual assault. To date, no research has examined the extent to which victims of sexual assault remember essential information about the crime, and systematic work of this kind is needed because detecting and prosecuting sex crimes is enormously costly, both to victims and society. First, a sex offender tends to commit a large number of crimes before being caught; hence, it is important to thoroughly obtain information from victims to detect and apprehend offenders as soon as possible. For example, polygraph interviews conducted with imprisoned sex offenders who had fewer than two known victims found that these offenders actually had an average of 110 victims and 318 offenses. Second, the Home Office estimates that the total cost of sexual offences is nearly &amp;pound;8.5 billion per year. Most of these costs relate to helping victims overcome trauma. Therefore, we need to apprehend a given offender as soon as possible reduce the number of people who are victimised. Lastly, intoxicated victims are currently a 'hot topic' because there is little to no research to guide police interview practice. Thus, the proposed research is an imprtant first step in describing and predicting memory accuracy in victims who were under the influence at the time of the assault. 

The proposed research may also contribute to reducing wrongful convictions. About 25 people every year in the UK receive between &amp;pound;500,000 and &amp;pound;1 million each because they were wrongfully convicted of crimes that they did not commit according to a 2010 UK Law Commission report (Consultation Report 190). Research in the US and in the UK has found that mistaken eyewitness evidence is the leading factor in cases of wrongful conviction. The proposed research may lead to the development of interview techniques that help prevent eyewitnesses from making preventable mistakes in their testimony. Additionally, by studying the characteristics of true and false memories (Experiment 1, using the AMQ) it may be possible to develop techniques for distinguishing between true and false memories in witnesses who were intoxicated. 

The proposed research will measure memory accuracy as a function of alcohol dosage and blood alcohol level. As a result, we will be able to describe the dose dependent relationship between memory accuracy and alcohol intake. What is more, we will be able to describe how memory for the perpetrator versus memory for other aspects of the rape scenario varies in relation to alcohol dose. If memory does vary in accordance with AMT, this is important information to disseminate to police investigators. Namely, it would encourage investigators to interview victims who were intoxicated thoroughly because they may remember critical details about the perpetrator that could lead to an arrest. Thorough interviewing may also uncover information about the quality of the memory which, given the proposed research is carried out, could be used to index its reliability.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-08-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>68237</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Crown Prosecution Service (CPS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>National Guidelines</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D843EF4-ABD2-4043-B88D-6FDF60C13D27</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Flowe, H., Carline, A., Takarangi, M., Humphries, J., French, S., &amp;amp; Prior, M.

Many of these attacks occur whilst the victim is under the influence of alcohol. Cases involving intoxicated victims are challenging to prosecute. Victim intoxication raises issues regarding the accuracy of testimony. We examined the influence of alcohol on remembering an interactive hypothetical sexual assault scenario in the laboratory using a balanced placebo design. Women's memory for the assault was 24 hours, 1 week, and 4 months later. We also considered whether central (i.e., information about the perpetrator) versus peripheral (i.e., the surrounding environment, such as bystanders) aspects of the scenario are differentially remembered depending on alcohol intoxication. Alcohol Myopia Theory (AMT) would predict that intoxicated women focus on central information at the expense of more peripheral information. Another question was whether women would be more susceptible to the influence of misleading postevent information if they were intoxicated rather than sober during scenario encoding. Finally, we were able to investigate alcohol expectancy effects on remembering, as half of the participants in the alcohol condition and half in the placebo condition were told that they received alcohol, whereas the other half were told that they received tonic.

Key findings were as follows: Participants reported less information (i.e., responded 'don't know' more often to questions) if they were under the influence of alcohol during scenario encoding. The accuracy of the information they reported, however, did not differ in comparison with sober participants, suggesting intoxicated participants can effectively monitoring the accuracy of their memory at test, as least at the dosage levels we investigated (BAC 0.04 to 0.08%). We did not find evidence in support of AMT; both sober and intoxicated women remembered more central than peripheral information about the scenario. Additionally, women who were intoxicated during scenario encoding were just as susceptible to misleading postevent information as women who were sober. Alcohol expectancy did not affect the amount or accuracy of information remembered. However, participants who expected alcohol reported having more intrusive memories about the scenario and were more concerned about gaps in their memory.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have begun to share our results with the Police, Crowne Prosecution Service, the College of Policing, and support agencies that serve sexual assault victims/survivors (e.g., Rape Crisis, Somerset &amp;amp; Avon Rape &amp;amp; Sexual Abuse Support). We have organised a series of workshops jointly with these stakeholders about how the research that we and other investigators have done can be applied to improve police interviews with victims who were intoxicated during sexual assault. The workshops will take place during 2015 and 2016, and are funded by the police, and the British Academy/Leverhulme foundation.
