The data systems and models we build offer prospects for practical testing of alternative transport scenarios on spatial structure by urban policy makers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The expected outcomes and impacts revolve around gaining a much better knowledge of social groups segregated by transport. We need to understand precisely why groups get locked out and this is not simply a matter of linking where they live to the transport available but relating this to other resources such as jobs, health and education. Any systems problem generates wide ramifications on other aspects of the urban system. We also need to identify the locations of such groups and this needs to be done with very detailed data systems at the level of streets and land parcels that approach the level of 'big' data. 

We will communicate our research activities and outcomes in the usual ways, through academic papers of various sorts. However as the portals are web-based, a web presence is essential to the way we will pursue this project and we therefore will quite seamlessly communicate our wares through the web and various weblogs. We have extensive experience of contemporary IT in terms of social media (see www.blogs.casa.ucl.ac.uk). CASA organises a yearly conference to support our dissemination and we will use this forum for engaging with a wider interest. Our trips to S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and London built into this proposal will be supported by seminars in both cities. 

We do not see IPR as an issue for all our software will be open source or at least non-proprietary. Our software for the various models is likely to be under a Creative Commons licence if there is a license at all. We will of course be careful about copyright of data that is collected and owned by others that we will use in the portal but we envisage most of this will be open data.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>212494</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>We will explore the impact of transportation on social segregation in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo and London,

the project has moved into a second phase and our first RA has moved to a lectureship at Kings. We now have comparative data and models of transport accessibility and segregation for Sao Paulo and for London and this is looking very promising. We had a short article on the BBC Brazil web site about the project</gtr:description><gtr:id>35F240BF-057A-4B49-A7F5-C604D66E9A55</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Environment,Retail,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have been at this grant for about 4 months and have already ascertained that the two cities are very different in terms of their transport, density and economic composition.

I really must object to having to fill this in as we have only been working on this for 4 months and we have met our Brazilian partners only once and will meet them again in London this June</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>to complete the grant research</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E26BBB62-D072-4C87-9216-D66CD253D010</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Energy,Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CAEA5044-7273-472D-9686-CC569B744058"><gtr:id>CAEA5044-7273-472D-9686-CC569B744058</gtr:id><gtr:title>Revealing centrality in the spatial structure of cities from human activity patterns</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Urban Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9102d2f08f60da2faded8af4cca89f9f"><gtr:id>9102d2f08f60da2faded8af4cca89f9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Zhong C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N011449/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>C087E953-30F3-4968-B0F3-D48A5998A2B4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Civil eng. &amp; built environment</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>3A4CB57C-9B22-41A2-AB15-127503299365</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Human Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>895D1683-DC4B-4292-BBC6-EC38672BFD10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>RCUK Programmes</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AEB7EC61-1574-4583-8B00-BD32275F29A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Complexity Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AF20B57E-E40B-45BC-85C8-DDC6F4777697</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Spatial Planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>0C5394E1-D713-4507-8021-0A9785789545</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Transport Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>AECBB1F8-45A7-48B4-9FBB-31FE4206AA69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban &amp; Land Management</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>19CA55B7-20B0-41C2-825B-06F2387EB8B9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Urban Geography</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes><gtr:rcukProgramme><gtr:id>C11BDEA9-7D9D-4728-B6A9-31032921B328</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Newton</gtr:text></gtr:rcukProgramme></gtr:rcukProgrammes></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
