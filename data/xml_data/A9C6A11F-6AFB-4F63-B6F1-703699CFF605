It will also attempt to assess how British and Irish theatre practitioners - from directors and actors to designers - have attempted to shape Beckett's work to the specific historical and cultural conditions within Britain and Ireland since 1955 in order to produce a distinctive 'aesthetic' for the work. The project will seek to evaluate the impact of producing Beckett's drama on the work of those practitioners, on contemporary practices of theatre directing, designing and performance, and on British and Irish theatre cultures (theatre programming, reviews etc). 

Samuel Beckett's theatre has had a major international impact not only on playwrights such as Edward Albee, Harold Pinter, Sarah Kane and Suzan-Lori Parks but also on mainstream and experimental contemporary theatre practice. His work attracts high profile directors (such as Peter Brook, Luc Bondy, Peter Hall, Yukio Ninagawa, Deborah Warner and Robert Wilson); West End and Broadway productions with star casts; and experimental interdisciplinary performance (such as the Mabou Mines' adaptations of Beckett or Katie Mitchell's installation programme of Beckett's late theatre). It has also featured on the programmes of touring and regional theatres. All of the above categories include many British and Irish productions, but influential studies such as Jonathan Kalb's Beckett in Performance (1989) and Lois Oppenheim's Beckett Directing / Directing Beckett (1997) tend to focus on Beckett's practice as a director of own work, on directors or productions undertaken in the United States (such as Alan Schneider or Joanne Akalaitis's controversial production of Endgame), or occasionally on productions by some European directors, such as George Tabori. 

In contrast, very little critical attention has been paid to the many productions of Beckett's work in Britain and Ireland. While some scholarship exists on a few directors - notably Sir Peter Hall's longstanding engagement with Beckett since the first British production of Waiting for Godot in 1955 - these accounts are frequently subjective and anecdotal. Much recent critical attention has focused on Beckett as an Irish writer with recent monographs including Emilie Morin's Samuel Beckett and the Problem of Irishness (2009) and Sean Kennedy's Beckett and Ireland (2010), but there are many gaps in research on productions of Beckett's theatre in Ireland and Northern Ireland. Some of these were included in an issue of the Irish University Review in 1984, and, more recently, work has been done on the Pike Theatre premiere of Godot (1995) and on the Beckett on Film project (2001), in which 19 of Beckett's stage plays were filmed and which featured a number of Irish directors including Neil Jordan, Enda Hughes and John Crowley. This grew out of the Gate Theatre Dublin Festival of nineteen of Beckett's plays launched in 1991. However, there is much scope for further research on the range of productions of Beckett's theatre in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and on the impact of such productions on the development of a Beckett aesthetic or style in UK and Irish theatre, or on acting, directing or designing practice (as in the work of Jocelyn Herbert). Moreover, hardly any research exists on regional or touring productions of Beckett's drama in Britain and Ireland. This project will offer substantial new data and insights into British and Irish theatre in the second half of the twentieth century. 

Our project aims to rectify such gaps and omissions in this area of Beckett scholarship through recognising and disseminating to the public, academic and theatre communities a detailed and critically robust study which will examine the long tradition of theatrically realising Samuel Beckett's work in the UK and Ireland.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
Since Beckett's work features prominently in British, Irish and international theatre and performance history and practice, this project will have a significant impact on (1) school, undergraduate and postgraduate students in a range of disciplines including Beckett Studies, Theatre and Performance Studies, English Literatures, Modern European / Comparative Literatures (2) theatre archivists (3) theatre practitioners and trainee practitioners undertaking a production of Beckett's work, or interested in engaging practically with the aesthetics of Beckett's theatre (4) the wider public, for whom Beckett's work continues to attract widespread interest. 

How will they benefit? 
(1) New research materials, knowledges and insights in relation to the study of Beckett's theatre. Beckett's plays are widely studied in literature and theatre courses in schools, colleges and universities. By researching and disseminating a comprehensive survey of productions of Beckett's theatre in the United Kingdom and Ireland, this project will provide new research materials and knowledge about the history of Beckett's theatre in performance, and into the ways in which Beckett's theatre has been produced across metropolitan, regional and touring theatres and productions in relation to conventions of performance, directing and design in Great Britain and Ireland during this period. The project will therefore enrich existing knowledge not only of Beckett's work, but of the distinctive, evolving cultures of the metropolitan and regional theatres investigated. We expect that the project will impact upon curricula and approaches to studying Beckett's theatre at secondary and tertiary levels.
 
(1) and (2) New data technologies and collaborative models of practice. The fact that the Beckett database constitutes a pilot launch of the National Performance Database will offer a model of recording, analyzing and disseminating data that will impact on archivists as well as on students and the scholarly community. The database will be able to capture user data in order to evaluate and demonstrate impact. The collaborative working methods involving scholars, the theatre community and archivists, and the skills necessary to undertake such collaboration, will also be offered as models of collaborative research. 

(1) and (3) Models of practice for practitioners and trainee practitioners. Many professional practitioners as well as trainee practitioners within or without the academy, generate new work through researching, citing or transforming past practice. The material gathered during this research and disseminated through the database, publications and conferences, seminars, broadcasts and public lectures, will offer a rich repository of diverse material on performance, design and directing practices relating to Beckett's theatre in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This material will be disseminated to professional or trainee practitioners through the database, broadcasts, sessions at conferences involving the theatre profession, and public lectures. We expect this material to inform many future productions of Beckett's work in diverse contexts. 

4) Enriched cultural engagement and understanding of Beckett's theatre and the heritage of metropolitan and regional theatre cultures on the part of the wider public. As numerous public events held by the Beckett International Foundation have testified, the public maintains a high level of interest in Beckett's theatre. This project will increase the accessibility of Beckett's drama to the wider public through its emphasis on specific productions and theatre cultures in the United Kingdom and Ireland, and will also enhance the public's knowledge and understanding of the rich metropolitan and regional theatrical heritage in these islands. The database, broadcasts and public lectures are aimed at such a broad public impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>668144</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Talk by Ronald Pickup April 15 Minghella Studios, Reading</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D52CBB27-DCD2-41D2-921C-6EB05EF0823A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was the final Public Talk in the project's series of interviews with theatre practitioners involved in productions of Beckett's plays in the UK and Ireland.

Rickson spoke about his production of Krapp's Last Tape at the Royal Court Theatre in 2006, featuring Harold Pinter. He discussed the challenges of staging both Pinter's and Beckett's plays, and the long-standing connections between both writers. There was a lively discussion afterwards where members of the public asked questions about directing Pinter in Beckett's work and the particular challenges of directing Beckett. A transcript of this talk will be publicly available on the Staging Beckett website, which is in development and will be launched in Spring 2015.

This is the first of the public talks which are part of the dissemination plans of the Staging Beckett project. The talk was widely publicised to the public.

However, during the course of the project, we have increased the awareness, understanding and appreciation of the important cultural heritage constituted by the performing histories of staging Beckett in the UK, Ireland and internationally, among theatre makers and programmers who have attended conferences and given talks and interviews, and amongst the general public who have attended public talks, interviews and exhibitions. 

Cultural institutions and organisations with which we have worked (such as the Annual Beckett Happy Days Festival in Enniskillen and the Omagh and Fermanagh District Council) have been impressed by the ways in which the pop-up exhibitions we have organised and the combination of original archival material with digitally presented material, has enabled the general public to appreciate the significance of productions of Beckett's plays to the local, national and international theatrical landscape, past and present, and the significance of archival materials in enabling ephemeral performances to become part of our cultural heritage. We expect to exploit the underlying performing arts database (which includes datasets from the National Theatre, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the English National Opera, and UK Theatre Web) in future years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>40AB6B4E-DD36-479B-B9CF-BE8CAAF9E67E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has uncovered the extraordinary extent to which productions of Beckett's plays have been staged throughout the UK and Ireland by the major national theatre venues and institutions and by regional and repertory theatres. Productions of Beckett's plays have acted as barometers of changing local, national and indeed international and global political and cultural climates over the last 6 decades. Productions of Beckett's plays are an integral part of the fabric of twentieth and twenty-first century cultural memory and performance history and heritage in these islands. 

The core academic findings of the project will be published in 4 outputs. Two related volumes of collected essays, co-edited by the two PDRAs on the project (McTighe and Tucker), are in press with Bloomsbury: Staging Beckett in the United Kingdom and Staging Beckett in Ireland and Northern Ireland. These will be published in the summer of 2016. In addition, two special issues of journals are in preparation: a special issue of Samuel Beckett Today / Aujourd'hui on Staging Beckett at the Margins, co-edited by PI McMullan and CI Pattie, to appear in 2017, and a special issue of Contemporary Theatre Review, on Staging Beckett and Contemporary Theatre and Performance Cultures, co-edited by PI McMullan and CI Saunders, will appear also in 2017. These publications include contributions from theatre practitioners as well as academic scholars. They emphasise that the overall impact and significance of staging Beckett in the UK and Ireland can be seen through detailed case studies: the significance of productions of Beckett's plays in the early years of programming the West Yorkshire Playhouse, for example, or of the Beckett Festival mounted by Cryptic productions in partnership with the Tramway and the Tron Theatre in 2000, both instances reflecting a growing cultural confidence in the cities as the programmers present the work of a writer perceived to be 'European' and 'avant-garde'. The Cryptic festival, Beckett Time, is also emblematic of the growing significance of Beckett's work being presented in Festival or Event packages (from the Gate Theatre Festival first launched in 1991), and also being presented in an interdisciplinary, creative arts festival bringing together visual artists, film makers and musicians, creative writers and theatre and performance makers. This indication that Beckett is an inspiration and impetus for cutting-edge interdisciplinary creative arts work is one of the most exciting of our findings. This interdisciplinarity is characteristic of the annual Beckett Happy Days Festival in Enniskillen, initiated in 2012, which has commissioned work from composer Gavin Bryers for example, based on Beckett's writing, and has showcased art inspired by Beckett by Antony Gormley, Tacita Dean as well as productions of Beckett's plays from across the globe. These Festivals are analysed in the above outputs. 

The project has also uncovered the impact of productions of Beckett's plays on theatre makers, scholars and members of the public. These are recorded in interviews which are being uploaded onto our project website, and in comments from some of our public events including public talks and question and answer sessions, and exhibitions. Productions or programmes of Beckett's plays, and the reviews, media coverage, talks and interviews associated with them, frequently constitute significant moments of engagement with an expanded sense of the limits, challenges, conventions and possibilities of the theatre medium. Recent more commercial productions have tended to focus on Beckett's plays as a vehicle for star performers which has introduced Beckett's work to a wider public.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The resources that we have provided (database, interviews, blog) can be used as the basis of educational workshops or public exhibitions in order to further engage specialist groups and the genera public in understanding and appreciating Beckett's work and in exploring their own memories of significant theatrical and performance events which form part of our cultural heritage. Several outputs registered under Engagement activities have already exploited this potential: workshops with Lagan College in Belfast for example, and the public exhibitions organised by the project team. The database and associated resources can be continually updated. 

The Staging Beckett database is a pilot for a wider national Performing Arts Database (PADB). The Staging Beckett project has developed the underlying infrastructure of the PADB and has provided a model for a public interface which could be rolled out for the PADB. We are seeking ways to develop the PADB in partnership with cultural institutions and interest groups who might benefit from the resources of the PADB.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B9B6E0C8-3E31-4E3C-A7FF-8E003D38FB96</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.reading.ac.uk/ftt/research/ftt-staging-beckett.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This database holds data on professional productions of Beckett's plays in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
