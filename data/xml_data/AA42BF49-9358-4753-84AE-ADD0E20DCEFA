These cells contain genes that control their ability to carry on dividing, but are also influenced by factors produced in the tissue that control how the cells develop. However, disruption of the tissue through injury may destroy certain populations of cells and change the environmental factors produced. We are interested in understanding how new cells that replace those lost through injury are programmed to re-colonise the tissue once it has healed.

The epidermis is the outer layer of the skin, and forms a water-tight barrier that protects us from dehydration and infection. The skin is constantly exposed to injury, and the epidermis contains several different populations of cells that continue to divide to maintain the tissue. Of these, Langerhans cells (LC) are a specialised population of cells that control immune responses in the skin. The progenitor cells that originally develop (differentiate) into LC enter the skin of the embryo before birth. They have the ability to keep dividing once they become LC, and in this way LC numbers are maintained in the skin indefinitely. If the skin is injured however, and LC are killed, then new progenitor cells must enter from the blood to replace the missing cells. These are different from the cells that originally entered the embryonic skin, and we do not know whether the LC that they differentiate into are the same as the original LC in terms of their ability to keep dividing and to control immune responses in the skin. We also do not know what types of cells are able to replace the damaged LC network after skin injury.

We have developed an experimental model in our laboratory, in which mild injury in the skin results in killing of the LC and their replacement by new cells, which we can track. Our research aims to use this model to answer three questions:

1. How does the repopulation of the skin after injury by different progenitor cells affect the ability of the new LC network to be maintained and control skin immune responses?

2. Which cells enter from the blood to replace LC after injury?


3. Do other cells in the epidermis produce factors that control the differentiation of the new progenitors that enter from the blood?

Together, the data we get from this research will help us to answer basic questions about the biology of LC, and also about how factors which are specific to a certain cell type work together with environmental factors in the tissue after injury to ensure that the cell population is maintained once the tissue has healed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Langerhans cells (LC) are a population of myeloid cells that form a contiguous network throughout the basal cell layer of the skin epidermis. The LC compartment is seeded before birth and is maintained in adult life by local division of differentiated cells. However, disruption of the network permits access to the epidermis of novel bone marrow (BM)-derived precursors, which establish a new population of LC. The identity of the precursors that give rise to long-lived LC is not known, but must be different from the macrophage-like cells that colonise the embryonic skin. In addition, extrinsic factors produced by other cells in the epidermis, such as dendritic epidermal T cells (DETC) that respond to stress-related signals in the skin, may also shape the differentiation of incoming cells. Therefore, repopulation of LC in the epidermis provides a unique and tractable model with which to directly compare how lineage priming (intrinsic) versus environmental (extrinsic) factors control the development and function of a novel population of cells.

We have developed a murine transplant model in which transfer of BM and host-reactive T cells to irradiated recipients results in deletion of the resident LC network and replacement by donor cells. In this proposal we aim to use this model to answer the following questions:

1. How does recruitment of an intrinsically different LC precursor to fill the epidermal niche affect the longevity and function of the resultant LC network?

2. Which blood-derived precursors are recruited to the epidermis following loss of resident LC?

3. Do DETC produce extrinsic factors that determine the LC-fate of recruited precursors?

Together our experiments will address fundamental questions about LC biology, and how intrinsic and extrinsic factors combine to control replacement of a cell population after disruption of tissue homeostasis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal aims to address questions of key importance to the fields of (stem) cell biology and immunology, and as such is likely to be of interest to, and benefit a broad range of beneficiaries. In particular, we expect this work to impact on academic scientists outside our immediate professional circle, clinical scientists interested in facilitating transfer of basic research to the clinic, and the general public, including school children as potential future scientists. 

Academic scientists: This research will provide important new data on fundamental aspects of cell biology and the impact of tissue injury on the fate and homeostasis of a replacement cell population. This information will be of benefit to academic scientists working across the fields of (stem) cell biology and immunology, who can build on our work within their own spheres of interest. In the short-term of the funding period we expect to benefit from this by opening up new networks and collaborations with international scientists. In the longer term we hope that this research will contribute to the realisation of funding to improve health by investigating how repopulation of Langerhans cells (LC) impacts on responses to disease and vaccination in the skin. Dissemination of the data and preparation of manuscripts for publication will provide the PDRA working on this project with key communication skills that are essential in all employment sectors.

Translational applications: Understanding how the cellular homeostasis of a tissue changes in response to injury, and how this may impact on the ability of that tissue to respond to subsequent infection and injury, will be of interest to clinical scientists with the facilities to build on our work to enhance quality of life in patients. While the immediate benefits of this work relate to basic cellular research, we intend to use our data to establish collaborations with translational researchers so that we can apply for further funding to explore the therapeutic aspects of manipulating the repopulating LC network. This would take place during the last months of the grant and we would expect the benefits of the future work to be realised in a 3-5 year period following this round of BBSRC funding.

The public / future scientists: We believe that the basic questions on which this research is centred are of interest to the wider public: (1) How are stem cells and precursors controlled by their genes and by the tissue around them? (2) How do tissues recover lost cells after injury? In addition, the immediacy of the skin as an organ that can be related to in health and disease, and the use of highly visual microscopic images for our study, mean that our work is very accessible to lay audiences, in particular school children. We hope that the public will benefit by understanding how important this type of research is as a building block for more translational studies that directly impact the nation's health, and that children will be enthused to pursue science as a career. We expect the PDRA to be actively involved in interacting with the public, which will foster the development of important skills in presentation and communication to non-specialist audiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>419739</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Institute for Immunity and Transplantation annual symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1695EC7-C8EB-40A8-B701-629B9C4D100D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited seminar at the Institute annual symposium.
