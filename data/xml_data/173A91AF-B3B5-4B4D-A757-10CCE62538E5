Gibraltar continues to be a major issue in Anglo-Spanish relations and at its very heart are the Gibraltarians who articulate a clear identity which is often passionate in denying any Spanish identity. This sense of being Gibraltarian, British and not being Spanish has not, however, been an unvarying constant over time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There is no doubt that it is the attitudes of the Gibraltarians which are at the centre of the issue of sovereignty and yet it is remarkable how little Gibraltarians attitudes to themselves and their Spanish neighbours has been studied. Gibraltarians sense of who they are is consequently poorly understood and often reduced to a caricature of expatriate Britons.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research project will conduct extensive oral history interviews with at least 400 residents of Gibraltar (with a small sample from across the border) focusing on three key aspects which underline the process of identity formation:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the border&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>ethnicity and religion&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>language&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Interviews will be conducted in English, Spanish, yanito (the local dialect), and Moroccan Arabic. The period covered will be from before WWII to the present day.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research will benefit a range of groups including the general public, the media, museums, interest groups and policymakers.

General public:

The general public will be major beneficiaries in terms of the creation of an unprecedented resource of oral historical accounts and linguistic material, as well as a film, which can be used for generations to come, helping to preserve Gibraltar's cultural heritage. The project will reinvigorate the debate about what it means to be Gibraltarian by enabling the local community to consider its past and gain a richer understanding of how their identity has evolved than has been previously possible. The interviewees will benefit from having their stories told; it will give them a voice and record their testimony for posterity.

Media:

The project as a whole, and much of the specific data, will be of great interest to the Gibraltar media in particular and provide a wide range of potential stories for them. The research team have excellent media links. There will also be media coverage in Spain and the UK through press releases and radio interviews.

Museums:

The project findings will impact on how Gibraltar represents itself in terms of its social history which will in turn have the potential to impact on how Gibraltarianness is represented nationally. An exhibition will be held at the Garrison Library which is open to the public. This will include archival material and video spots of people involved in the project talking about key historical events in their own words. The exhibition will focus on lived history as experienced by individuals rather than as abstract events recorded in pictures and print. A similar exhibition based around the World War Two evacuation of civilians from the Rock will be held at the Imperial War Museum in London. As well as the social and cultural benefits, the exhibitions will increase visitor numbers and income.

Interest groups:

The Gibraltar Heritage Society, the UK-based Friends of Gibraltar Group and Gibraltar House (the official residence of Gibraltar's UK Representative) will all benefit from their involvement in the project's activities. The outputs and findings will help them foster UK-Gibraltar links, contribute to heritage campaigns and promote interest in Gibraltar in the UK.

Policymakers:

UK policymakers will benefit from the research because it will clarify a significant element of UK policy towards Gibraltar and Anglo-Spanish relations. A more sophisticated understanding of Gibraltarians' attitudes towards the UK and Spain will be beneficial in developing policy and help serve to avoid repeats of some of the tensions of the past decade where the UK Government clearly miscalculated the response of Gibraltarians, much less understood why.

Spanish policymakers will benefit by gaining a better understanding of Gibraltarians' sentiments. This project will be important in improving relations with Spain because it will show the areas of commonality that can be fostered as well as providing a more nuanced understanding of the areas of greatest intractability. This project will be particularly interesting in the context of the new Instituto Cervantes in Gibraltar whose aim is precisely to foster better cultural understanding. The Institute's Director, Francisco Oda, is known to the PI and very interested in facilitating the research.

Gibraltarian policymakers will similarly have a better understanding of their own populations' attitudes which, to date, have only been surveyed on a superficial level on the basis of short questionnaires. 
 
The project will also benefit the UK Parliamentary House of Commons All-Party Gibraltar Group which takes a keen interest in Gibraltar's affairs and for whom the politicised identity of Gibraltarians is a compelling issue.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>422800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Shane Dalmedo, one of the project's researchers and an embedded artist produce a short video piece for a public event.
