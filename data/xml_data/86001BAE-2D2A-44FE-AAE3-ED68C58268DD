future</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008173/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The ways we have lived with energy in the past has often changed - and will change again. The question is: what changes do we want and how do we tell these stories of change?

The 'Stories of Change' project works with a range of communities to explore the varied and changing ways in which humanity has lived with energy in the past, and the choices available to us all in the future. It draws on history, literature, social and policy research and the arts to encourage a more imaginative approach to energy choices. The project supports the cross-party commitments to decarbonisation that sit at the heart of the UK Government's Climate Change Act. Research has shown that many people feel disengaged, disempowered or actively hostile to the kinds of changes to the UK's energy system required to meet the targets embedded in the Act. Societies the world over are faced with pressing shared challenges about future energy choices. Polling points to wide acceptance that actions will be required to reduce demand and cope with future environmental hazards. But new developments and measures to manage or reduce demand can generate conflict. Our project seeks to make space to work through the areas of conflict and identify elements of a collective vision. 

We are inspired by the example of the Mass Observation movement's stories of everyday life in the UK, above all in the 1930s and 1940s. Their work combined a desire to give ordinary people a voice, radical innovations in social research and bold new ideas about media and the arts. It has inspired our three objectives: 

1. To listen to and give a platform to more diverse, often unheard, voices;
2. To mobilise change through research and the arts, and;
3. To innovate in use of digital media. 

'Stories of Change' is organised around three mini research projects, or 'stories' and one cross-cutting project 'Energetic' that supports these, and draws wider conclusions. The project works with communities in three locations; each representing a different area of life. 'Policy Story: Demanding Times' gathers a novel mix of communities of interest around energy policy, and generates new accounts of energy policy and politics past, present and future. 'Industry Story: Future Works' is rooted in the English midlands, and seeks to unearth fresh accounts of the long relationship between energy, industrial making and landscape, and explores where it might go next. 'Everyday Story: Life Cycles' engages with the role that energy resources have played in shaping communities and everyday life in south Wales, from migration, for example from within Wales and as far as Somalia to work with coal, to new movements of people and things that support the UK's largest wind array.

We are working with stories because they offer a popular and engaging route into thinking about the past and present and imagining possible futures, and also because stories, narratives and narration are concepts that people from a range of academic and creative disciplines can gather around. History, digital storytelling, fictional narratives, and scenarios of the future all communicate different ideas about the consequences of change for everyday life, and explain different perspectives and attitudes towards change.

We will gather these stories - old and new - into an online publicly accessible collection (our 'Stories Platform'). We will offer pathways ('stories') through the materials, but it will also be easy for users to browse, or make up their own stories of change by threading material together using digital tools we provide. The academic team will also produce academic articles and a book, policy briefs and popular materials. The communities, our creative partners and the research team will also collaborate to produce a mix of creative writing, songs, short films, performances and museum and festival shows.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>IMPACTS OVER TIME There will be specific impacts within the life of the project, but it is also a platform from which we will develop a longer term body of impacts and university-community relations (including policy). Our Digital Strategy supports future evolution. Our Creative Commissioning Strategy will co-produce a body of finished work, but also fund development phases and seed applications for co-funding from Arts Councils England and Wales and charitable trusts, extending impacts in scale and time.

COMMUNITY IMPACTS To support progress towards more sustainable communities, we will:
* Uncover and channel, through co-design and co-production principles, the messages felt to be relevant by communities we work with via policy, web and other media pathways
* Leave a skills and capacity legacy - e.g training young people in eliciting oral histories, developing digital storytelling techniques and online documentary content
* Develop new connections within and between communities and new confidence around the value of their stories (via events programme; workshops; online tools)
* Reveal and promote, through our creative commissions and Stories Platform: a fuller account of popular views about and ideas in response to policy challenges and opportunities amongst policy communities (story 1); a wider range of views and ideas about low carbon futures by those involved in the industrial sector, supporting progress towards a greener economy (story 2); and a richer account of energy systems transformations as they affect everyday life, opening routes to environmental sustainability (story 3)

POLICY IMPACTS We view policy communities and their networks as a key constituency, rather than simply end users. To support progress towards the goals of the Climate Change Act we will:
* Produce policy briefings in print and podcast form
* Present key findings to policy audiences in local authorities and UK and Welsh Government
* Create greater awareness amongst policy makers of the range of responses to and ideas about low carbon transitions
* Extend awareness and experience of novel forms of community engagement rooted in stories, co-production and use of digital tools and platforms
* Support a novel body of 'connections with communities' for policymakers, and awareness of the potential and hazards surrounding co-design and co-production

CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS AND CREATIVE COMMUNITY IMPACTS Partnerships with museums, heritage bodies, galleries, festivals and media, as well as our creative partners, will support ripple effects, make many connections and ensure findings are heard well beyond the immediate communities and partners involved in the project. To help create longer term impacts we will:
* Critically evaluate impacts drawing on current academic research and leading arts impact evaluation practice
* Connect communities further with arts organisations and practitioners and seed further partnerships and engagement

TEACHER &amp;amp; LEARNER IMPACTS We will create 'learner pathways' through the Stories Platform content, and tools supporting user-generated content and permitting users to generate and share their own pathways/stories

MEDIA IMPACT To scale the impact amongst general publics we will:
* Catalyse fresh approaches in mainstream media storytelling about environment, society and energy, overcoming stale, incomplete representations of conflicts or static accounts of energy systems
* Create an online Story Platform to inspire users through the diversity and dynamism of humanity's life with energy, and allow them to: browse 'raw' content supported by semantic web tools; follow curated pathways; upload content and generate their own pathways

TEAM IMPACTS All members will develop digital humanities/social science, social media and digital media skills. They will also develop skills in rare but prized interdisciplinary multi-institution team-based working, and reflect on and promote awareness of the skills required.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1169421</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>2 poems inspired by our visit to interview Tom as part of the oral history interviews</gtr:description><gtr:id>E328F331-C5F8-42DB-B024-72AEF91673CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>artistic output was unsolicited and prompted by our visit and made author reflect on local wind farm development</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Tom Cadwallader</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of designed outputs including:

2015 UPDATE:
All our partners have contributed in varied ways. Some have conducted creative events with the aim to engage with the public and collect data for the research project (e.g. the NTW team and Emily Hinshelwood). Others have advised us and worked jointly with us to organise and run events (such as Artis Community, Welcome to our Woods and Storyworks UK in the case of the Treherbert pop up studio). Overall, they have contributed to the development and running of aspects of the project. BBC and RCT provided archives. 

[March 2016 update] Since the last update, we have had further contributions from some of our partners (e.g. Storyworks UK - editing of digital stories based on Treherbert interviews) 
The Local chapels group (Treherbert) invited one of us onto a live programme on Rhondda Radio for a debate on energy issues 
We have been collaborating with community representatives in Ynysybwl for the AHRC Connected Communities Utopias Festivals with the event scheduled in May.

2015 UPDATE:
The Story 3 team has been carrying out research activities in partnership with creative practitioners and a variety of community groups in a number of communities in South Wales. We carried out a series of oral history interviews in Ynysybwl with community members whilst we worked with community and project partners to run a pop-up story studio in Treherbert and we are currently planning workshops in both of those localities to share the materials that emanated from the activities. In Butetown and Tairgwaith, we commissioned creative partners to undertake and facilitate workshops around poetry and creative writing workshops respectively, supporting those activities as appropriate in conjunction with project partners. 

[March 2016 update] We held a series of &amp;quot;return workshops&amp;quot; in Ynysybwl where we showcased the edited oral histories we gathered earlier in 2015. In Tairgwaith, a series of six creative writing workshops took place through our commissioned partner, Emily Hinshelwood with a book being produced from the participants' writing for launch on 3 May 2016. In Butetown, work with some of the Somali community including women, older men and younger people by our NTW team partners culminated in a sharing event on 19 October 2015 when their worked was showcased to community members.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Future Works</gtr:description><gtr:id>291260D7-4393-461A-9A2C-3B48E62E0707</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Series of creative outputs from Portland Works partnership as part of One Great Workshop Live Project (Sept-Nov 2014), including blog, mappings, artefacts, design work, website content, info-graphics, performance, films and public presentations.

2015 UPDATE:
The Story 3 team has been carrying out research activities in partnership with creative practitioners and a variety of community groups in a number of communities in South Wales. We carried out a series of oral history interviews in Ynysybwl with community members whilst we worked with community and project partners to run a pop-up story studio in Treherbert and we are currently planning workshops in both of those localities to share the materials that emanated from the activities. In Butetown and Tairgwaith, we commissioned creative partners to undertake and facilitate workshops around poetry and creative writing workshops respectively, supporting those activities as appropriate in conjunction with project partners. 

[March 2016 update] We held a series of &amp;quot;return workshops&amp;quot; in Ynysybwl where we showcased the edited oral histories we gathered earlier in 2015. In Tairgwaith, a series of six creative writing workshops took place through our commissioned partner, Emily Hinshelwood with a book being produced from the participants' writing for launch on 3 May 2016. In Butetown, work with some of the Somali community including women, older men and younger people by our NTW team partners culminated in a sharing event on 19 October 2015 when their worked was showcased to community members.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cynnal Cymru Sustain Wales</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Everyday Lives</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFD882B0-770E-402A-9CFC-D49CADC2D48B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>2015 UPDATE:

2015 UPDATE:
All our partners have contributed in varied ways. Some have conducted creative events with the aim to engage with the public and collect data for the research project (e.g. the NTW team and Emily Hinshelwood). Others have advised us and worked jointly with us to organise and run events (such as Artis Community, Welcome to our Woods and Storyworks UK in the case of the Treherbert pop up studio). Overall, they have contributed to the development and running of aspects of the project. BBC and RCT provided archives. 

[March 2016 update] Since the last update, we have had further contributions from some of our partners (e.g. Storyworks UK - editing of digital stories based on Treherbert interviews) 
The Local chapels group (Treherbert) invited one of us onto a live programme on Rhondda Radio for a debate on energy issues

- eighteen blog posts for the Stories of Change blog

- fourteen interviews (ranging in length from 20 to 50 minutes) with energy experts from: national and local government; print and online media; academia and policy think tanks; community energy projects; the energy industry; and campaigning organisations. 

- a short film.introducing the project. This is available on the blog, on Vimeo, and on the AHRC Connected Communities Media Collection website

- produced thousands of photos, both contextual of the project's work, and photobooth portraits of experts, team researchers, and members of the public around London. These will be available through the project Flickr feed. 

- A summative 50 page report provides a substantial account of the activities and key findings of the project so far, including initial analysis of the data from recordings of training and evaluation session. This will be the starting point for academic publications in the future.

- three academic publications are planned drawing on the significant body of research data that the project has produced, to be submitted to impactful journals

- a range of engaging and informative material that can be used in teaching materials. Using the material from the interviews and vox pops, and with support from the Open University OpenLearn team, open-access teaching materials will be produced and made available on the OU OpenLearn site.

Some have conducted creative events with the aim to engage with the public and collect data for the research project (e.g. the NTW team and Emily Hinshelwood). Others have advised us and worked jointly with us to organise and run events (such as Artis Community, Welcome to our Woods and Storyworks UK in the case of the Treherbert pop up studio).

2015 UPDATE:
The Story 3 team has been carrying out research activities in partnership with creative practitioners and a variety of community groups in a number of communities in South Wales. We carried out a series of oral history interviews in Ynysybwl with community members whilst we worked with community and project partners to run a pop-up story studio in Treherbert and we are currently planning workshops in both of those localities to share the materials that emanated from the activities. In Butetown and Tairgwaith, we commissioned creative partners to undertake and facilitate workshops around poetry and creative writing workshops respectively, supporting those activities as appropriate in conjunction with project partners. 

[March 2016 update] We held a series of &amp;quot;return workshops&amp;quot; in Ynysybwl where we showcased the edited oral histories we gathered earlier in 2015. In Tairgwaith, a series of six creative writing workshops took place through our commissioned partner, Emily Hinshelwood with a book being produced from the participants' writing for launch on 3 May 2016. In Butetown, work with some of the Somali community including women, older men and younger people by our NTW team partners culminated in a sharing event on 19 October 2015 when their worked was showcased to community members.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Blind Summit</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Future Works</gtr:description><gtr:id>09CBA4F7-B9F7-4A73-950D-3933526CBDE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Series of creative outputs from Portland Works partnership as part of One Great Workshop Live Project (Sept-Nov 2014), including blog, mappings, artefacts, design work, website content, info-graphics, performance, films and public presentations.

Some have conducted creative events with the aim to engage with the public and collect data for the research project (e.g. the NTW team and Emily Hinshelwood). Others have advised us and worked jointly with us to organise and run events (such as Artis Community, Welcome to our Woods and Storyworks UK in the case of the Treherbert pop up studio). Overall, they have contributed to the development and running of aspects of the project. BBC and RCT provided archives.

2015 UPDATE:
The Story 3 team has been carrying out research activities in partnership with creative practitioners and a variety of community groups in a number of communities in South Wales. We carried out a series of oral history interviews in Ynysybwl with community members whilst we worked with community and project partners to run a pop-up story studio in Treherbert and we are currently planning workshops in both of those localities to share the materials that emanated from the activities. In Butetown and Tairgwaith, we commissioned creative partners to undertake and facilitate workshops around poetry and creative writing workshops respectively, supporting those activities as appropriate in conjunction with project partners. 

[March 2016 update] We held a series of &amp;quot;return workshops&amp;quot; in Ynysybwl where we showcased the edited oral histories we gathered earlier in 2015. In Tairgwaith, a series of six creative writing workshops took place through our commissioned partner, Emily Hinshelwood with a book being produced from the participants' writing for launch on 3 May 2016.

?A Scenario Workshop: with UTC apprentices on energy and making
?Conversations with invited speakers, including Stuart Mitchell and Dr Joe Smith open to the general public: 'One Great Workshop' ('OGW') on energy and making in Sheffield. We shared narratives surrounding the steel industry past and present with those involved with the industry and artist Nicola Ellis, whose sculptural work involved welding and steel fabrication.
?Industrial Walk led by Now'N'Then/ Timewalk Sheffield.
?Sheffield Live 'Green Friendly and Different' radio programme &amp;amp; TV broadcast, with Stories of Change RA Ryan Bramley and Charlotte Morgan and Interview with Renata Tyszczuk, Julia Udall and Charlotte Morgan on Monocle Magazine Radio Show

We are in the process of organising a series of focus groups to take the recordings back to the communities they came from and explore with them the meaning of listening to those for their thinking about the future of energy.

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and at the same time a story that the mainstream media seem to have little appetite for. What is going wrong, and who is responsible? Joe will draw on twenty years of experience of research but also practical projects at the join between media decision-making and environmental research and policy to sketch out some answers. He will explore the roles of media organisations, environmental NGOs, the research and policy communities and audiences/citizens/publics (us!) in constructing climate change as a 'difficult story'. Joe will also test and invite ideas about how we can all play a part in devising new storylines - above all some hopeful ones.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cugs.co.uk/events/2017-02-02-joe-smith---climate-change-in-the-media%3A-the-greatest-story-never-told%3F</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public lecture.

Working with creative partners fanSHEN, a theatre company with experience of making participatory theatre, and with photographer Tim Mitchell, the research team and the POT devised engaging and creative activities to encourage people to thinking imaginatively about our energy future. 

Members of the POT worked with fanSHEN to devise and run Model London, a game in which teams competed to devise solutions to our energy challenges &amp;shy; either ways of producing clean energy or using it more efficiently &amp;shy; and then critique their opponent's ideas. The purpose of the game was to highlight some of the complexity and interdependence of our energy challenges, and the need for creative and utopian thinking around solutions. Teams then worked together to build the winning solution out of lego, which was then displayed on our giant printed map of London. Proposals ranged from the sensible to the fantastical! 

The team worked with photographer Tim Mitchell, to further evolve the project's 'photobooth' which asks people to write a question about energy, and the pose for a portrait with their question. This has been developed as a provocation to discussion around energy generation and consumption. 

Energy Generation ran two event days at London's City Hall. The first, on 23rd April, was part of the Who Are Ya? event organised by the Peer Outreach Team, which drew a large and diverse crowd of young people and representatives of organisations working with young people. Approximately 300 people attended the event, and approximately 100 participated in our activities. 

The second was our eventmodel London, held across a full day on the huge satellite&amp;shy;photo&amp;shy;map floor of City Hall's lobby. This event was well advertised both within City Hall, and to wider networks, including posters around CIty Hall, and emails to all departments, and particular encouragement to the Mayor's Environment team to participate. As a result we had excellent participation across the day, including the Chief Advisor to the Mayor on Energy and Climate Change and several other members of the Environment team. Approximately 150 people participated in our activities, including employees at City Hall, two school groups visiting City Hall, and other visitors and tourists.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Treherbert Pop-up Story Studio</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D1F9D3AC-BD8F-4D93-A095-70C0B18883E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- Regular entries on blog https://storieseverydaylives.wordpress.com/

There were 700 visits from over 500 members of the local community in Treherbert to a pop-up story studio we co-created with project and community partners on the theme of energy in the past, present and future. Some people came just once but many visited several times over the duration of the studio. During the interviews carried out, visitors discussed how their relationship to energy in the specific context of a coal mining community has evolved and continues to evolve. They also talked about the uncertainties over the future of energy in their local community. In ad hoc interviews, they reported that the studio was a great success and it had helped them to remember stories of their past, to connect with other community members and to express their views on the future of energy. We also had email and verbal feedback from some of the community groups involved who said the event was a resounding success.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://storieseverydaylives.wordpress.com/category/project-updates/treherbert/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Brilliant Club Scholar's programme for Year 12 students based on stories of change research</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>030CD17E-A8B1-465A-A740-40D30E55E6CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>8 pupils attended 6 tutorials organised by the Brilliant Club, an educational charity that works towards widening participation in HE and that Mel Rohse has been working with since Sept. 2013.

Playing the audio stories of South Wales to the students proved a particularly interesting activity which sparked discussion about the past energy challenges that older generations would have faced. The pupils compared that with their own experiences and with the privileges they are afforded now.

The event, which took place at the Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution on 2 September 2016, was organised and introduced by Professor Axel Goodbody on behalf of the 'Stories of Change' team. Opening with a presentation from Drs Bradon Smith (University of Bath and Open University), Renata Tyszczuk (Sheffield), David Llewellyn (South Wales) and Mel Rohse (Birmingham), the evening got underway with highlights from the team's work during the first two years of the project. Showing how members of the Stories of Change team have successfully built relationships with communities in London, the West Midlands, and South Wales, the presentation took the audience through the project's approach from facilitated discussions about changing patterns of energy generation and consumption, to recorded interviews, all of which will be made accessible to researchers and the general public on a dedicated web platform shortly. These presentations were followed by an illustrated reading by the Scottish poet and artist Alec Finlay, entitled 'A Primer for the Archaeology of Energy'. Exhibited at the Tate Modern and many other galleries, Finlay's work exemplifies, in a unique way, the role which the arts can play in making energy visible in our everyday lives, and the impact of old and new forms of energy generation on people and the landscape. The evening closed with a Reception hosted by the University of Bath's Pro-Vice-Chancellor (Learning and Teaching), Professor Peter Lambert.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future Works and One Great Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E718B3F-13EF-416B-AF51-A9AD16FD4C87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two blogs and twitter accounts, plus sharing via facebook and Portland Works website, relating to Future Works and One Great Workshop [@energeticstory @1greatworkshop www.storiesfutureworks.wordpress.com www.onegreatworkshop.com www.portlandworks.co.uk] plus two public presentations including the showing of a film, the first to 150 people and the second to 30 people it a cutlery factory. Discussion and questions around the topic of energy resulted.

The students involved in the live project, when interviewed later discussed how their relationship to energy and climate change had evolved over the time of the project, leading to a desire to include it in every aspect of their work, rather than as an add-on at the end.

Our launch event, the TippingPoint/Stories event, brought 130 participants, including 80 artists and 20 from the business and policy communities, together to explore fresh ways of engaging with energy and climate change. In the eighteen months since then we have convened or participated in events in community and cultural centres and museums and shared our approach and early findings in policy, business, media and arts gatherings. In addition to sharing our material with these groups we have also sought ways to share our methodologies for thinking in fresh ways about significant societal transitions (in our case primarily about energy). We have built new partnerships since autumn 2015, including with journalists (BBC and former BBC) who have conducted or written in response to 'hard to get' interviews, and also forged a new project partnership with the Energy Institute. We have also created opportunities for some of our young community partners to speak directly with leading media figures. As PI I have been having meetings with NGO, charity and policy people to explore possibilities for scaling our approach. The Future Works strand has developed closer bonds to industrial partners in the English Midlands and is looking at an energy retrofit toolkit and workshop process, and the South Wales based Everyday Lives strand has extended its work with community partners in Ynysybwl, Treherbert, Tairgwaith and
Butetown. Diverse methods rooted in sharing stories and memories have been deployed, in partnership with creative and community partners.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A5C7B3F0-B32B-49DB-86F9-346A8E35281B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The End of the Truth War (presentation to BBC Academy Data Day - presenting alternative approaches to coverage of energy and climate change</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9775A795-A3FB-4470-8151-170B58D0DFD5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Policy advisory meetings: one to one hour long meetings with senior Whitehall civil servants, arranged by invitation by the Cambridge Centre for Science and Policy.

The one hour meetings see the academic share their expertise in relation to a body of questions previously submitted by the Fellow. These meetings have tended to draw directly on both my research for the Stories of Change and Earth in Vision projects, and to the older but still relevant Interdependence Day project. The questions pertinent to my work have spanned: environmental sustainability and systems change (energy; transport etc); public understanding and engagement; new tools for public participation in policy; media decision-making. On most occasions climate change has been a prominent thread. I have explicitly outlined the research projects and the origins of the funding (AHRC for Earth in Vision and Stories of Change, and when relevant NERC-ESRC for the Interdependence Day project). The fact that I am so regularly asked to contribute to this programme run within and for another university suggests that the organisers (CSaP of the University of Cambridge) are getting positive feedback about the policy relevance and professional value of my advice and opinion.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/policy-fellowships/policy-fellows/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>BBC3 Climate Change Brainstorm</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>07FACB33-D7BA-43A7-9FE3-4555416350FF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I devised, cast and facilitated a workshop for BBC Three senior commissioners and executives and a body of independent and in house producers that introduced them to the state of the latest thinking on climate change in the wake of the Paris UNFCCC talks (COP21). This took the form of a 50:50 'expert/media' meeting of around 20 people. My script was informed by my close knowledge of BBC treatment of climate change across three decades, drawing on the AHRC funded Earth in Vision project. But amongst the 'experts' were two of the young people who had participated the previous summer in the AHRC funded Stories of Change project. They represent the channels target demographic, and were able to talk about their own journey with energy and climate change issues, and own experience of producing their own media on the topic, due to their involvement in the project. The meeting was designed to help BBC Three consider commissions on the topic and encourage independent producers to develop ideas to pitch. But it was also designed to give the experts present - including people from architecture, fashion, and energy fields, UK and international - greater insights into media decision making.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation of Energy policy experts</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0A3FFB7-E951-4394-B777-58834263BDA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Working with young Londoners who are part of the GLA's Peer Outreach Team, we arranged training in interviewing and media recording skills, and then arranged for them to interview fourteen energy experts from across national and local government; print and online media; academia and policy think tanks; community energy projects; the energy industry; and campaigning organisations. Interviews ranged in length from 20 to 50 minutes, and feedback from participants - from, for example, DECC and City Hall - indicated that the experience of being interviewed by these young people was very stimulating. One aim of the project was to bring together two communities that might not otherwise meet, to facilitate a mutual exchange of views on energy policy, including what matters to todays' young people around energy and environment.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://storiesdemandingtimes.wordpress.com/category/energy-generation/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Developed by photographer Tim Mitchell this tool enables the visualisation of questions about energy change.
