emergency investigation of disease outbreak to improve knowledge of drivers</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/N007646/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Catastrophic disease events can be devastating for the survival of threatened species, and can reverse years of conservation effort. When populations are already small and vulnerable, due to poaching or habitat loss, disease can be the final straw. Examples of disease as a conservation issue include the Ethiopian wolf, which is susceptible to distemper and rabies from domestic dogs, and rinderpest, which decimated the wild and domestic ungulate populations of Africa in the 19th century. Recently it has been recognised that disease is best understood and tackled in a wider context than just the individual species of host and pathogen; resilient ecosystems are better able to accommodate disease outbreaks, and human-caused environmental change can make species more vulnerable.

The saiga antelope is a migratory ungulate which gathers to give birth in large aggregations. It is critically endangered due to a &amp;gt;95% decline in population size over &amp;lt;10 years due to poaching for its horns and meat. However one population (Betpak-dala) has recovered well, to about 250,000 individuals in April 2015. Mass die-offs from disease occur regularly in this species, but the causes and contributing factors have never been properly investigated. In May 2015, 120,000 saigas died within a few days in the Betpak-dala population, about half this population, and &amp;gt;1/3 of the global population. For the first time, a rapid response team was able to attend and collect samples from the affected saigas and their environment. Initial observations suggest that the deaths were a result of a complex interaction between particular environmental conditions (wet weather, lush grass) and the weakness of females which had just given birth, causing pathogens which were present but latent within the saigas to take hold. This is not the whole story, however, which may also include toxins in plants or water, an insect-carried disease, or a directly-transmitted virus.

In this project, we will analyse the already-collected samples to diagnose the causes of and contributing factors to this mass die-off. We will run an urgent mission to the field, to collect supplementary information which will help us to home in on the triggers for this disease. We will visit both affected and unaffected areas, to understand what the differences are. We will talk to local herders, and get weather records for the days leading up to the deaths. Next, we will compile everything we know about this outbreak, and about previous outbreaks (recent and historical, in saigas and similar species), to get an overall picture of the pattern of events and environmental conditions which leads to mass saiga deaths. Combining this understanding with projections of future environmental conditions (e.g. climate change) and emerging infectious diseases (e.g. peste des petits ruminants, which is entering Central Asia from Africa), we will explore scenarios of risk from a range of diseases to both saigas and livestock, and how risks could be mitigated (e.g. through vaccination or changes in land use practices).

Having assembled this evidence, we will help the Government of Kazakhstan to prepare for future disease outbreaks; we will design surveillance protocols so they can have early warning of potential triggers for mortality, and help them to examine whether, and which, interventions might reduce the risk of outbreaks, or mitigate them. We will run a technical workshop at the upcoming meeting of the UN Convention on Migratory Species' Memorandum of Understanding on saiga conservation, and support signatories (governments and NGOs) to develop and ratify an action plan.

This project is a unique chance to investigate a dramatic and complex disease event of huge conservation importance, which will also shed light on the relationship between environmental change and disease. This makes it of wide general interest for ecologists, and an opportunity which it is vital to take while there is still time to act.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of this project will be of major global interest, evidenced by the huge amount of press coverage worldwide, e.g. the New York Times, the Australian Broadasting Corporation, Liberation (France), Scientific American, New Scientist, Nature, Guardian, Independent, BBC (several branches). Team members R. Kock (RVC), S. Zuther (ACBK), E.J. Milner-Gulland (Imperial) and A. Kuhl-Stenzel (CMS) have been interviewed extensively. The coverage highlights the mystery surrounding the cause of death. As this project is specifically aimed at clarifying this, there is significant potential for substantial impact. 

Range state governments, particularly Kazakhstan, require guidance and support to plan effective disease surveillance and control, and to conserve this species given its proneness to mass mortality events. The Kazakhstan government has set up a Commission to investigate the saiga deaths and make recommendations, with RVC as a member and RIBSP as coordinator; this will be a key avenue for engagement. Specific relevant branches of government are: the Ministry of Agriculture, National Reference Veterinary Centre, State Veterinary Laboratories, Forestry and Hunting Committee (wildlife management authority), Analytic Control Department of Ecology, Kazakhstan Environment Ministry. Other range state governments will also benefit from understanding the potential for disease and the appropriate response. 

The general public internationally, and particularly in Kazakhstan, will benefit from information on the causes and response to this outbreak, and about future planning to mitigate future outbreaks. The project's scientific approach will reassure the public about the transparency of the assessment. Frequent references in the media to possible transnational influences, rocket testing and historic toxicologies is liable to raise tensions and political heat without a sound open research programme. The independence of UK engagement will provide a strong signal to Kazakhstan's political and civil society that the Ministry is acting in a responsible and transparent manner in its investigation.

Scientific institutions: Currently there is a lack of capacity for wildlife disease monitoring and diagnosis in Kazakhstan. The project will benefit partners RIBSP by tying them into international support. It will also provide the UK's Pirbright Institute an opportunity to use new technologies in their refurbished laboratories, including next generation sequencing to screen for possible immunosuppressive viral pathogens.

International organisations: Project partner CMS, which coordinates the MOU on saiga conservation, will draw lessons from this research for other species in its portfolio. IUCN - the World Conservation Union's Species Survival Commission will benefit from improved understanding of the conservation implications of disease in threatened species. The project will benefit FAO's newly establishing Astana office, supporting their role in the country and improving understanding of the threats to saigas in the context of emerging agricultural development policy on the steppe. 

NGOs: Project partner ACBK is the main conservation organisation in Kazakhstan, and works closely with government on saiga conservation. It will benefit from a better understanding of the issues surrounding saiga disease and how to prepare for and respond to future outbreaks. Internationally, the Saiga Conservation Alliance (chaired by co-I EJMG) and project partner FFI will benefit from better understanding of saiga disease, supporting engagement with donors and the general public to build a basis for future conservation action. Other beneficiary NGOs working on saigas include Frankfurt Zoological Society, Birdlife, Wildlife Conservation Society, WWF. 

The research will provide full results in the short time frame of a year, but we hope to provide an initial diagnosis and report by the time of the CMS's technical meeting in early September.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>51811</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Pirbright Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pirbright Institute</gtr:description><gtr:id>A53BE28E-0067-45E4-AF1A-CEBEEBA8E079</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Confirmed absence of virus of potential concern to the massive die off of saiga antelope in Kazakhstan.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>NGS on samples from Kazakhstan saiga mortalities to confirm viral absence or presence</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Providing material of interest to PI investigations on viral diseases from Central Asia</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>German Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Friedrich Loeffler Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Freidrich Loeffler Institute Berlin</gtr:description><gtr:id>FDD1DF9F-F5F7-46F1-879C-B29BB0547D9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sampled analysed by NGS and Pasteurella multocida pathogen identified and genotyped.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>NGS and pasteurella multocida genomics</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Provide material for general virological research at FLI from Central Asia</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wildlife Conservation Society</gtr:description><gtr:id>9726A4F2-783D-405B-A84D-BE2836C9BE30</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Review of histopathological material</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing of saiga material for histopathology review</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FCVMS</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>122C587C-D394-4D38-91C1-6C71D922221A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk to the One Health Society of the Vets and Medics at University of Cambridge on the saiga mortalities</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Landscapes and infectious disease - where are the boundaries?

The unusual nature of these events has generated global interest amongst the general public and specialist communities working in disease and with wildlife. 
The importance of research and monitoring has been shown to clarify complex disease ecologies and the need for better systems in National authorities to undertake this work including development of laboratory and field capacities and collaborations in Central Asia and particularly Kazakhstan. Constraints of transfer of samples across National boundaries has also arisen and momentum given to modifying Convention in International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) rules to facilitate diagnostic specimen movements and accelerate diagnosis.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0E2B766F-86A4-4D87-B1EB-B68E07977630</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The emergency grant enabled on ground and laboratory and other studies to better understand the event, its impact and the causes. 

The field mission in June 2015 after the mass mortality event (MME) in May clarified the extent and impact showing some surviving animals in the central core population of saiga and this was confirmed subsequently to be about 30,000 animals out of a total of 250,000 estimate. It is not clear if these came from affected aggregations or unaffected groups in 2015 but it was known that many male groups were much further north than the animals during the event and apparently were unaffected. No obvious extension of this MME to livestock or any other species was identified during post MME investigations. 

The further pathological investigation undertaken with this grant from samples collected during the MME has reduced the differential diagnosis to one significant aetiology for the mass mortality event (MME) in 2015. The pathology confirms haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) as the disease caused by opportunistic infection of saiga antelope at a population scale. The causative organism is Pasteurella multocida serotype B genotypically identical across outbreaks in 2015 and highly virulent. It is similar to other isolates of HS in domestic animals and saiga from earlier pathologies in the Eurasia. No other pathogens or toxicologies of significance and no viral co-infections have been identified using new generation sequencing on blood.

The epidemiology and laboratory results together strongly suggest that this was not a primary infectious disease outbreak but rather invasion by commensal bacteria (which the majority of saiga were presumably carrying), associated with an environmental trigger. The mechanism of infection could be either bacteriological, through a change in invasiveness or virulence and a cascade effect, or related to loss of host immunity at the mucosal surface, causing adult saiga to develop rapid fatal septicaemia. This was a near universal effect across a landscape and discrete aggregations at calving. Horizontal transmission most probably occurred, to some extent, following initial cases, but the rapid and near-synchronous onset points to a common environmental trigger rather than spread from pathogen introduction, although prior environmental conditions may have also contributed to higher prevalence of these bacterial parasites in the population. Calves died after the mothers, suggesting that there was not a lot of horizontal infection occurring as they would be highly vulnerable to this and die more rapidly, rather they acquired the infection through milk at the time of the die off.

These findings have focussed analytic efforts on environmental covariates that may have triggered this remarkable event; exploring these triggers statistically is the next stage of the work for this project (supported by the matched co-funding raised during the project). Current analysis of available data and controls over the five days leading up to estimated onset of die off in 2015, suggests an association with weather factors (the most significant being indicators of atmospheric moisture such as dewpoint temperature and relative humidity; Annex 3.8). This would be in line with understanding from the literature about the environmental associations with clinical signs of Pasteurella multocida septicaemia, which include high humidity.

Other factors such as snow and NDVI (plant growth) anomalies, higher low mean temperature range are also significantly associated but require more statistical work to clarify due to data issues. Other related studies include plant surveys which show considerable variation across the MME range and it is unlikely any plant community is relevant but the NDVI anomaly and association of sward length or abundance with humidity might be of interest. 

Evidence review suggests that at least one other historic outbreak, that of 1988 in Kazakhstan can be ascribed to be of a similar nature, with some other outbreaks showing some similarities in 1984, 2010. 

To further an understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the HS and infection with P. multocida sampling was undertaken under the project in 2016 on the surviving breeding aggregation in Betpak Dala and in the Ural population. From this PCR evidence for commensal bacteria of this type were found n 2 individual healthy calves, where the bacteria would not be expected, suggesting transfer of bacteria from the mother in the first days of life of a non-pathogenic character. Understanding of the prevalence of P multocida in the adult population is important to better explain the epidemiology of the MME as horizontal transmission cannot explain the rate and extent of infection observed. Any horizontal transmission is likely to take place between adult females at calving nest sites (aggregations within the aggregations for the period of calf delivery) shown by measuring the distances between nests at these sites showing a high density of animals. The other mechanism of transmission if from mother to calf most probably through the milk as evidence gathered suggests. 

Livestock investigations in 2016 showed no clear association between any species and saiga during the MMEs nor in terms of disease patterns. A better understanding of the interface in this geographic region where disease is clustering was achieved and relevant to future livestock management with respect to disease risk and saiga. 

There is also association between die-off events and calving, both temporally and in terms of geography. Review of ungulate die-offs in temperate systems with Pasteurella spp., reveals that they are frequently reported in conjunction with some adverse weather event, but the nature of these potential stressors is inconsistent and statistically robust analysis is lacking in all but a few cases. Nevertheless, the idea of weather triggers of wildlife die-offs from bacterial septicaemia is compelling across the northern temperate zone (Annex 3.5). Clear causal links and mechanisms for the triggering of the haemorrhagic septicaemia confirmed in 2015, occurring at a population level, are yet to be fully determined but considerable progress is being made to enable plausible hypotheses to be tested.

The NERC grant has provided an excellent platform to begin to explore the complex disease ecology of the saiga antelope, and its findings will have relevance to a much wider geography and animal science community. Haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) was considered second only to rinderpest in the Asian subcontinent in terms of impact on livestock over the 20th century, but was largely controlled through the use of vaccines. It remains a concern in many situations of modern agriculture and with some evidence of resurgence globally. Whether climate change is the key here is debatable but the science is needed to prove or disprove this as a driving force in the HS die off syndrome. The epidemiology of the disease tends to point to the need to investigate non-infectious diseases and parasite dynamics, ecologically linked to the environment. Natural populations are an excellent indicator of change in the environment and specific habitats, usually through changes in their own populations and their parasites, and saigas covering a huge landscape are a case in point. 

This event and the timely data collected through the project demonstrate that spontaneous invasion of the blood stream of the host (through body membranes or other route) by commensal parasites (in this case bacteria which might be an integral component of the gut microbiome) has the potential for large scale impacts on populations of threatened ungulates. The likely triggers are environmental and the risks of similar events in this and other systems in future are unknown, but could be substantial under increasing climate variability. Implications extend beyond conservation of individual species to ecosystem health and integrity, and disease risks for life support systems including agriculture. Mass mortality events from bacterial diseases have also been reported in reindeer, caribou and musk oxen in the northern temperate zone and Arctic and some speculatively linked to climate change. The extensive communication through the project, with other researchers working in this sector has led to a proposal to establish a community of practice working in particular on mass die-off events and the environmental factors leading to bacterial proliferation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Range states, conservation and research institutions under the guidance of the CMS process are adjusting policies and actions including future research and saiga conservation management priorities according to the findings so far.

This work will contribute to the overall debate on climate change and mass mortality events particularly in the northern hemisphere.

The pathologies and role of pathogens from within the mammal microbiome, in disease emergence events have been advanced and opens a major area for research to clarify these unusual and dramatic epidemiologies of wide significance.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>72E91A63-F501-4CB4-9CF9-289A8B542461</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CMS COP Saiga range states</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C66E046C-A786-4E06-90D8-8AFD51A462D1</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Kazakhstan Government Wildlife Disease Outbreak policy and standard operating procedures</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43FC1B96-33E5-49EC-95CD-BE22B444AB43</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The policy will improve the conservation of wildlife particularly saiga in Central Asia.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Development of a spatial model for exploring possible environmental co-factors to explain mass die off of saiga antelope Kazakhstan
