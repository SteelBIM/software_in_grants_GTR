That in turn has triggered a growing debate about judicial independence, and judicial accountability.\n\nThe judges are institutionally more independent, with a separate Supreme Court, and the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary in place of the Lord Chancellor. But they still feel uneasy. At their insistence, the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 places a statutory duty on Ministers to uphold judicial independence. \n\nThe Act does not define judicial independence. If it is to be upheld, it must be clearly understood by all the actors who are required to protect it. So two questions addressed by this project are:\n- What is the meaning of judicial independence, and its proper limits?\n- How is it best protected, and by whom?\n\nThe new arrangements also raise questions about accountability. The Lord Chancellor was politically accountable for the whole judicial system. Who is now accountable, and to whom?\n\nResearch questions\n- How do different political and legal actors understand judicial independence and judicial accountability?\n\n- What are the day to day contexts in which judicial independence and accountability arise as issues?\n\n- Who are the guardians of judicial independence, and accountability? How much coordination is there between them?\n\n- What do the new arrangements tell us about the changing relationship between the judges, government and Parliament?\n\n\nAcademic importance\nThere is little writing about judicial independence in the UK, and no accepted body of theory. We intend to develop a body of theory which explains the rationale for judicial independence and accountability in the UK, their proper limits, and practical requirements.\n\nMost books on judicial independence are comparative, edited collections. Ours will be an in depth study of how judicial independence and accountability operate within a specific system. It will examine not just high profile clashes, but the day to day decisions on the budget and management of the court service, judicial pay and pensions, complaints and discipline, appraisal and training. In the process it will identify all the 'hidden guardians' within the executive, parliament and the judiciary whose everyday decisions define how judicial independence and acccountability are interpreted in the UK.\n\nPolitical importance\nThe project is very timely. A decade of constitutional reform has transformed the constitutional landscape, with much greater separation of powers. The Lord Chief Justice has 80 staff to support him in his new role. Parliament has invited the judges to explain how the new system works. \n\nAll the actors - politicians, judges, parliamentarians and officials - are questioning different aspects of the new system, and developing a new set of rules. It is the perfect moment to capture the formal and informal conventions which are being developed; to explore emerging differences of view and the reasons behind them; and to suggest how some of those differences might be resolved. \n\nOutputs\nThe main outputs will be \n- a book\n- an interim and final report for policy makers\n- three academic articles\n- articles in practitioner journals.\n\nImpact\nThere will be a series of high level practitioner seminars running throughout the project; public lectures; a website and blog; interviews for radio and TV; articles for the press, and for legal and political magazines. \n\nProject team and timetable\nThe research team have long experience of working with government, Parliament and the judiciary. Prof Robert Hazell (Constitution Unit, UCL) will lead the project, working with Prof Kate Malleson (Queen Mary) and Dr Graham Gee (Birmingham). It will be a three year project, running from Sept 2010 to August 2013.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1 Who will benefit from the research? \nBeneficiaries from outside academe include all three branches of government, the legal profession, the media, NGOs and the general public.\n\nThe judiciary\nJudges and their officials and advisers.

The research findings challenged conventional wisdom about the relationship between the branches of government and the best way to protect judicial independence. The Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, has publicly referenced the research findings on a number of occasions in support of a more proactive approach, saying in a lecture that 'judicial independence is best served by more, not less, day-to-day engagement with government and Parliament.' Likewise, on 7 November 2016, Lord Hodge, Supreme Court Justice, argued for greater engagement between politicians and judges referring in support to the project and its 'warning that the disengagement of politicians from the justice system could be the greatest threat to judicial independence in future'. 
 
The Chair of the House of Commons Justice Committee, Sir Alan Beith MP, explained that the research had been 'very helpful to the Justice Committee at a time when we were actively developing the engagement of the judiciary with Parliament in ways which did not threaten that independence.' Nick Walker, the Clerk to the Justice Committee also noted that 'the research has provided welcome legitimation of the approach of Parliament and its committees to their relations with the judiciary, especially in supporting the idea that the judiciary should be less nervous about engaging with us. This is also supported by the important empirical evidence assembled and analysed demonstrating the increasing frequency and variety of judicial appearances before select committees, combined with the fact that the constitution has not collapsed as a result.'
 
Nor was the impact limited to England and Wales. in the speech by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Declan Morgan, at the opening of the legal year in September 2015, he drew on the research findings to argue for changes the arrangements for managing the courts: 'A recent study in the UK concluded that enhanced judicial independence and greater accountability are often two sides of the same coin, and highlighted the benefits of more active and transparent involvement of the Judiciary in the management of court business. I would, therefore, encourage the Department of Justice to give serious consideration to the possibility of legislating for a non-ministerial department in the next Assembly mandate.'</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>49C8F24B-3248-4BCA-B70F-67692A56816D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>?Judicial independence is a political achievement. That needs greater recognition, by the judiciary, but also by its multiple guardians in the Executive and in Parliament.

?Judges now enjoy greater power over judicial appointments, discipline, deployment, the courts service. They should be more accountable for the greater power they wield. They must give a fuller account of their stewardship to government, Parliament, the legal profession, the media, the wider public.

?Judicial independence is not a fixed concept. The core of judicial independence is decisional independence: the need for individual judges to be able to decide cases according to the law, free from any improper pressure. But around that core, everything else is negotiable, and continuously being negotiated

?Greater separation of the judiciary has increased the need for regular and close consultation with the other branches of government. Otherwise there is a risk of increasing lack of interest and disengagement by the political branches

?The pay freeze and reductions in judicial pensions were not a threat to judicial independence. But to ensure that the government pays competitive salaries, the convention that judges cannot return to practice should be abandoned.

?Parliament is a central guardian of judicial independence, with the new Select Committees more constant and systematic guardians than were the law lords. The judiciary deserve credit for their willingness to engage with parliamentary committees: it is a valuable two way dialogue.

?The judicial appointments commission is now an efficient recruitment agency but the judiciary has too much influence in the selection process while the Lord Chancellor's role over individual selections has been reduced to a rubber stamp. Attempts to improve judicial diversity are undermined by this marginalisation. The Lord Chancellor should be given real choice in relation to senior appointments, with a short list of three names. If that raises concerns about political bias, the appointees should be invited to pre-appointment scrutiny hearings by a joint parliamentary committee, to test their independence.

?Many judges are still in mourning for the old-style office of Lord Chancellor. But overall the judiciary and judicial independence have emerged stronger from the 2005 changes, with the inclusion of Tribunals into the judiciary and the courts system, a more independent and visible Supreme Court, and greater autonomy of the Lord Chief Justice as the new head of a more professionalised judiciary.

?Judicial accountability is also stronger, in particular through the frequent appearances by the LCJ and other judges before parliamentary committees. But the LCJ needs to submit an annual report, and parliamentary committees need to learn to be less deferential.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We were invited to give a presentation to the Judicial Executive Board, the Judiciary's 'Cabinet' (the Lord Chief Justice and his Heads of Division etc). We were also invited to a similar private discussion with the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice and her senior staff.

They all now have a much better understanding that judicial independence has multiple guardians, in the Executive and in Parliament as much as in the Judiciary: to take two examples, the MoJ Permanent Secretary and the Clerk of the House of Commons had not previously recognised their guardianship role, but they do now.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B3DAB1A4-006B-4F62-B98C-B2F14552B01F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/constitution-unit/research/judiciary-human-rights/judicial-independence</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Recognition by judges, politicians and civil servants that with the greater separation of powers following the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, the three branches of government need to engage more with each other, not less, in order to uphold judicial independence and strengthen judicial accountability</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F8F9A12-95E1-4C5E-9277-943D38ADA466</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Through practitioner seminars, conferences, meetings with the senior judiciary, ministry of justice officials and members of the judicial appointments commission, oral and written evidence to parliamentary select committees, written submissions to consultation papers, blog posts, journal articles and a monograph published by Cambridge University press, the research has led senior judges and politicians to rethink the way they approach judicial independence. In particular, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, has publicly referenced the research findings on a number of occasions in support of a more proactive approach by the judiciary to protecting judicial independence. During the three year project we ran 12 high level Practitioner Seminars at which senior figures such as the President of the Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice, chair of the Justice Committee, former Lord Chancellors and Cabinet Secretaries all attended and spoke. These seminars became an important forum to develop a stronger dialogue between the three branches of government about their shared responsibility for upholding judicial independence. They were such a success that we secured an extension of AHRC funding for a further six months to develop them. In June 2014 we were invited to give a presentation to the Judicial Executive Board, the Judiciary's 'Cabinet' (the Lord Chief Justice and his Heads of Division). In 2014 we were also invited to a similar private discussion with the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Justice and her senior staff. In Parliament we gave a talk to the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Constitution [date]. These meetings gave key stakeholders a much better understanding that judicial independence has multiple guardians, in the Executive and in Parliament as much as in the Judiciary.
In a lecture on 22nd June 2015 at the Institute for government, the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas stated that he: 'welcomed the study as a very important contribution to an on-going discussion, and more importantly, an on-going series of constitutional developments.' In September 2015 in a speech to the commonwealth magistrates' and judges' association he specifically referred to the findings of the research in arguing that 'the judiciary needs to engage with the other two branches of State within the confines of the Constitution', noting that the research had demonstrated that the result of recent constitutional changes was that 'judicial independence is best served by more, not less, day-to-day engagement with government and Parliament. It has also necessitated a much more proactive stance by the judiciary in promoting an understanding of the importance of justice and in taking more proactive steps in many areas it might traditionally have left to others.'</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy
