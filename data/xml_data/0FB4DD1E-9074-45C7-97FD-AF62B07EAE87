Proposals will be encouraged from across the community, and will be developed with support from our Knowledge Exchange and Research Commercialisation teams, and the Cabot Institute. An Assessment Panel will meet in December 2013 to award funds to proposals meeting these criteria:
- Proposals must make a clear link to NERC-funded research
- Projects should involve an external partner (business shall be emphasised)
- Clear plans for delivering downstream impact on an appropriate timescale
- An indication of next steps both practical and financial e.g. through KTP, TSB funding or commercial investment.
Expected outcomes are:
- 3-5 business engagement projects, mentored by a member of the Knowledge Exchange, Research Commercialisation or Cabot Institute teams, including members of the external Advisory Board.
- Follow-up plans for continuing the business engagement and achieving impact
- Shared institutional best practice during proposal development, which is then embedded in research groups through regular mentoring meetings

Objective 2 - 
We wish to develop cross-cutting impact activities in areas of strategic importance for the University of Bristol. To trial this approach we will invite the Cabot Institute to develop a proposal in the area of &amp;quot;Risk and Hazard&amp;quot;, to be reviewed by an internal panel as for Objective 1 above. This will be written in collaboration with the Dr Andrew Wray, Knowledge Exchange Development Manager, and Cabot's External Advisory Board. There will be &amp;pound;35,000 available from the NERC Phase II fund to be matched by at least &amp;pound;35,000 of Cabot's own direct funding.
The proposal is yet to be fully developed; however, we anticipate appointing an 'Industry Liaison Fellow' to develop industry and user engagement in areas such as volcanic, seismic and flood risk anazard. The Fellow will create and run innovation sandpits and stakeholder workshops to identify and develop new impact projects building on NERC research. They will also work with existing NERC investments, e.g. PURE Associates.

Expected outcomes are:
- Innovation sandpits on relevant topics
- Specific future projects and proposals which emphasise potential impact
- Development of new and existing collaborations with external partners 
- New understanding of how to develop cross-project impact in future rounds of Impact Acceleration.

Objective 3 - 
We will allocate &amp;pound;5,000 to developing impact case studies in three ways:
i) Our text-based 2012-13 case studies have received some online interest but we believe we can make more of this existing material. We also have REF Impact Case Studies some of which could be developed for a wider audience.
ii) The five Phase I projects have progressed well and may provide valuable new case studies in how we create impact as well as its consequences. We will also review other recent projects, collaborations and awards to identify new studies.
iii) The University has made use of video in recent years to showcase research, researchers and to illustrate how science operates for potential students and research beneficiaries. We shall explore the use of images, video and exhibition material to maximise the impact of our impact.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201620</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Between April 2013 and March 2015, the University of Bristol was awarded &amp;pound;270k IAA with objectives to:
? Strengthen interaction between NERC funded science and the business community to accelerate and amplify the impact of NERC science
? Increase the number of high quality case studies related to the direct and/or indirect impact of NERC science

Overall, 16 projects have been funded over three rounds. Subject matter has been broad, with applications from the schools of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth Sciences and Geography. Outputs include a social network of conservation practitioners, a volcano modelling website for hazard monitoring, a global flood analytics company, and the launch of a new business partnership programme to bring together companies and academics to solve environmental and risk-based problems. A list of awarded projects is at [add web link].
Funding calls have been promoted across the University and proposals assessed by a Funding Panel of School Research Directors, School Impact Directors, the Director of the Cabot Institute and the Director of Enterprise. The award has been managed by Research and Enterprise Development (RED), who have provided in-kind support and guidance to academics and companies. Individual project reports are available on request. Highlights from Bristol's IAA are:
? The formation of 1 new company, SSBN - a global flood analytics company, which has received 7 contracts totalling &amp;pound;185k, and &amp;pound;258k in further grant funding for the research group.
? Projects with 20 company partners.
? Engagement with 6 policymakers, 10 NGOs and 4 universities.
The total external support leveraged to date is &amp;pound;868,055 . This includes:
? &amp;pound;25,500 in-kind support and &amp;pound;608,288 industry income, showing that IAAs unlock private sector investment in innovation
? &amp;pound;234,267 in further innovation grant income.
? Leverage of funding from the STFC IAA.
This represents more than 3 times NERC's original investment only a short time after projects have finished. This investment and the impacts that follow will continue to grow and we will report on these in future years.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>1CE09BA1-7667-4BB6-A444-17F236E118A4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant supported a dozen projects developing impacts and benefits from a wide range of NERC-funded original research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Each funded project has made plans for the further development it's partnerships and impacts, whether through business-focused grants, collaborative R&amp;amp;D or direct industry investment</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FFA7AA97-E744-4533-9429-9B7FB2979E3F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Dr Juliet Bigg's group used IAA funds to build a Global Volcano Deformation system which hosts data on 1,000 volcanoes.

The research group forms a world leading authority in the field of modelling flood risk, and SSBN was started by four of its members. We aim to utilize the unique skills of our team to provide cost effective flood risk analytics based on cutting edge research methods. We aim to transfer this knowledge to deliver truly innovative and cost effective products, enabling our customers to make confident decisions based on robust estimates of risk.</gtr:description><gtr:id>99727E7A-F77E-42B1-A711-A116DF2439DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>SSBN is collaborating with Google and NASA JPL on new global flood data layers.
The company made its first sale of flood risk data in Summer 2014.

o SSBN won contracts with insurers such as Sompo Canopius, for US flood data. 
o Been invited to NASA Flood Response Workshop 2016
o Incorporate their model in the World Bank's &amp;quot;THinkHazard!&amp;quot; tool
o Produced data for all Africa at 90m resolution; discussing applications with NGOs.
Those flooding projects have led to new work in the University itself with reinsurance experts Guy Carpenter LLC, and inspired production of a UoB Global Flood Model to be used on GCRF projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:url>http://www.ssbn.co.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:yearCompanyFormed>2013</gtr:yearCompanyFormed></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">NE/L012731/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5B25B6A3-B218-4F11-8A9D-661236DF455C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agri-environmental science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EE4457DB-92A3-44EA-8D5F-77013CC107E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Climate &amp; Climate Change</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>794345CD-A1D5-4984-ADDD-088BCF41822F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Agricultural systems</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4237918D-61A8-47E0-91EE-65E98661A88B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth &amp; environmental</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BE94F009-26A1-4E5B-B0B3-722A355F282C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geohazards</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>396591D1-8226-43A9-991D-8E0D265D99D0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Regional &amp; Extreme Weather</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>052183D5-AB83-4C5E-97FA-7B0C1D4AF3FA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>20</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Volcanic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
