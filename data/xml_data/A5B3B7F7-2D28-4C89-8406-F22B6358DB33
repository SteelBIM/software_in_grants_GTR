Use of large quantities of variable generation sources has already caused changes to the way electricity networks are designed and operated but as penetration pushes onward to 30% and thence to 50%, it becomes significantly more challenging to maintain the stability and availability that people have come to expect. It is widely said that the resolution of this problem is offered by a smart grid but despite much discussion of smart grids there is still a lack for detailed specification of the intelligent and automated functions required to operate network of the future..An example smart grid feature is that, to a much greater extent than today, demand needs to be influenced to follow available generation. With the advent of half-hourly resolution of electricity bills, facilitated by smart meters, there is a mechanism in place to reward customers who make their consumption flexible and responsive to changes in electricity availability and price. In this example of &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; technology there are very many questions over how exactly this might work, how people would engage with this technology and how coordination of millions of individual actions will add up to stable operation of the grid.

We set out to answer two broad questions. First, how exactly should new computational techniques help mange the future grid? Specifically how can we use decentralised control to perform demand-supply balancing (and voltage control, etc.) at a local level and facilitate coordination and collaboration between decentralised controllers. Also, as part of that, how do advances in data analytics help gain useful control information from the masses of data being produced in the system. Second, in this more complex system, how do we analyse the risk of a system failure and design in resilience to mitigate risk. Traditionally we have had good models of the probability of the failure of, say, a transformer. How can we analyse and design for the highly variable behaviour of customers' responses to short term electricity prices and the short term fluctuation of PV and wind energy. New design principles are needed to ensure continued high reliability of supply. Being smart about the use of decentralised control and the harnessing of newly available data is crucial to ensuring we provide an electricity system able to incorporate large amounts of renewable energy without burdening us with undue cost or degrading performance.

Alongside these specific technical ambitions, HubNet maintains its role in bringing together the many academic groups who can contribute, not just electrical power engineering but also computational sciences, energy economics and behavioural modelling. Further, our role is to be the conduit for the academic community to converse with the network operators and equipment vendors so as to keep our research relevant to the sector's major challenges and provide a route to demonstrate and deploy our findings. We will continue to help identify the key research questions for the community to address and we will continue to use our findings as evidence to support energy policy and regulation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate creating impact under the following headings
 

1. With the Technical Community
Following the pattern of the existing HubNet consortium, we will use position papers to elaborate what we collectively see as the research questions in key topic areas. In this extension to HubNet we will base the formulation of those positions on the outcomes of a number of 1-day research colloquia. The existing position papers have been very widely read, the first 9 having been downloaded 5,000 times in total.

The continuation of the Smart Grid Symposium will also ensure we have a single place each year where our disparate technologies are reviewed together, and our researchers are exposed to the whole cross-disciplinary community. 

Our international academic impact will naturally arise through publications in leading journals and international conferences. Moreover our continued interaction with other research programs, such as RCUK's Energy Programme's joint projects Indian, Chinese and, shortly, Korea. 


2. Research Translation and Innovation
HubNet universities, and their research programmes have been a significant source of analytical support to projects supported by the Low Carbon Network Fund and the new NIC/NIA funds. These activities have been the main conduit for creating industrial impact from HubNet's academic work. We will work with the ENA and exhibit at the LCNI conference to ensure this continues to be the case. 

We will continue to contribute to the DECC/Ofgem Smart Grid Forum and the IET/DECC Future Power System Architect project to influence the sector's collective view on innovation. We will also continue to contribute to standards bodies, notably Cigre Technical Brouchures.


3. Wider Public Impact
We will use the HubNet website to continue to have a broader presence. Many HubNet academics contribute interviews of new and science output in broadcast and print media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2049875</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>keynote speech at Energetika  2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F23422F4-9061-4425-A180-F35DB5C0A118</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Key note speech at the conference talking about challenges and solutions to control of future power networks with RES and storage</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visit to industry colleagues in California to broaden impact links</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>70A7BEC9-0469-40E8-86B4-105D3F75197E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visit to colleagues in California, including CA Independent System Operator, Public Utilities Commission, Stanford Research International, Electric Power Research Institute.
