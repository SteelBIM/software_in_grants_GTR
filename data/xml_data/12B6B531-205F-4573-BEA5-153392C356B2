Images</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K023578/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Imagine being able to take a camera out of doors and use it to capture 3D models of the world around you. The landscape at large, including valleys and hills replete with trees, rivers, waterfalls, fields of grass, clouds; seasides with waves rolling onto shore here and crashing onto rocks over there; urban environments complete with incidentals such as lamposts, balconies, and the detritus of modern life. Imagine models that look and move like the real thing. Models that you can use with to make up new scenes of your own, which you can control as you please, and render in how you like. You can zoom into to see details, and out to get a wide impression.

This is an impressive vision, and one that is well beyond current know-how. Our plan is to take a major step towards meeting this vision. We will enable users to use video and images to capture large scale scenes of selected types and populate them with models trees, fountains, street furniture and such like, again carefully selecting the types of objects. We will provide software that recognises the sort of environment the camera is in, and objects in that environment, so that 3D moving models can be automatically created.

This will prove very useful to our intended user group, which is the creative industries in the UK: films, games, broadcast. Modelling outdoor scenes is expensive and time consuming, and the industry recognises that video and images are excellent sources for making models they can use. To help them further we will develop software that makes use of their current practice of acquiring survey shots of scenes, so that all data is used at many levels of detail. Finally we will wrap all of our developments into a single system that shows the acquisition, editing and control of complete outdoor environments is one step closer.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>630625</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>BBC Research &amp; Development</gtr:department><gtr:description>OAK Industrial Advisory Panel (BBC, Gobo, DNeg, Foundry)</gtr:description><gtr:id>82D47F0E-2369-4EE9-BBC1-A1BBF39B53FC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are actively engaged with partners to transfer our research IP into their hands.

A virtual world is a simulated environment in which users may interact with virtual objects and locations of the virtual world. Each user may control a respective avatar through which the user may interact with other users' avatars in the virtual world. An avatar generally provides a graphical representation of an individual within the virtual world environment. Avatars are usually presented to other users as two or three-dimensional graphical representations that resembles a human individual. Frequently, virtual worlds allow multiple users to enter the virtual environment and interact with one another. Virtual worlds are said to provide an immersive environment, as they typically appear similar to the real world and objects tend to follow rules related to gravity, topography, locomotion, physics and kinematics. Of course, virtual worlds can suspend or alter these rules as well as provide other imaginative or fanciful environments. Users typically communicate with one another through their avatars using text messages sent between avatars, real-time voice communication, gestures displayed by avatars, symbols visible in the virtual world, and the like.

Some virtual worlds are described as being persistent. A persistent world provides an immersive environment (e.g., a fantasy setting used as a setting for a role-playing game, or a virtual world complete with land, buildings, towns, and economies) that is generally always available and where events continue to occur regardless of the presence of a given avatar. Thus, unlike more conventional online games or multi-user environments, the virtual world continues to exist and plots and events continue to unfold as users enter (and exit) the virtual world. Virtual environments are presented as images on a display screen and some virtual environment may allow users to record events that occur within the virtual environment.

SUMMARY
Embodiments presented in this disclosure provide a computer-implemented method of scene generation. The method includes receiving an image depicting a scene and annotated by a sparse set of labels. The method also includes generating, based on the sparse set of labels, a dense set of labels annotating the image and a density map associated with the image. The method also includes generating a virtual scene based on the dense set of labels and the density map, where the virtual scene is output.

Other embodiments presented in this disclosure provide a computer-readable medium for scene generation and containing a program which, when executed, performs an operation that includes receiving an image depicting a scene and annotated by a sparse set of labels. The operation also includes generating, based on the sparse set of labels, a dense set of labels annotating the image and a density map associated with the image. The operation also includes generating a virtual scene based on the dense set of labels and the density map, where the virtual scene is output.

Still other embodiments presented in this disclosure provide a system for scene generation. The system includes one or more computer processors and a memory containing a program which, when executed by the one or more computer processors, is configured to perform an operation that includes receiving an image depicting a scene and annotated by a sparse set of labels. The operation also includes generating, based on the sparse set of labels, a dense set of labels annotating the image and a density map associated with the image. The operation also includes generating a virtual scene based on the dense set of labels and the density map, where the virtual scene is output.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7DF2AC56-E5A8-4296-9DD3-C8D9509DEE13</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None so far.</gtr:impact><gtr:licensed>No</gtr:licensed><gtr:patentId>US9262853</gtr:patentId><gtr:protection>Patent granted</gtr:protection><gtr:title>VIRTUAL SCENE GENERATION BASED ON IMAGERY</gtr:title><gtr:yearProtectionGranted>2016</gtr:yearProtectionGranted></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput></gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. We discovered general principles to create naturally looking output that mimics a given style. We demonstrate this in one publication on generation of landscapes with realistically looking vegetation (which is very close to the original proposal), but also in more general terms, as evidenced by a recently accepted publication on synthesis of different handwriting styles.

2. We discovered a novel approach to capture complex reflectance properties of a natural surface material in a practical setting -- with nothing more than a hand-held camera phone. This is a critical ingredient of OAK's overarching goal of practical capture of natural phenomena.

3. Similarly, we contributed improved methods for practical, hand-held geometry capture using inexpensive, off-the-sheld depth cameras.

4. We further developed a fundamentally new geometry capture approach that works for highly specular surfaces, a regimen where traditional scanning approaches fail, by extracting shape directly from observed surface reflections.

5. We improved our methodology for combining image analysis and machine learning, and evaluated them in an applied context, by training a system to accurately count drosophila eggs in microscope images.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the base technologies we developed and published could be used by others (subject to licensing requirements - with one method we are currently pursuing a patent application.)

We hope that, in the upcoming year, these technologies will further combine to create overarching content creation solutions that are of more immediate value to our industrial partners from the special-effects and games industry.

In addition, we started putting these technologies to a use in cultural-heritage digitisation applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BFFECEF2-77DE-4B84-B24A-D5F9824EBFFA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset contains photos and calibration for many camera views of each specular object.

Mean shift is usually associated, in computer vision at least, with the segmentation of an image. Whilst this library supports that scenario, it is far more general. Mean shift is a gradient ascent method for finding the modes of a kernel density estimate, so this library is as much a kernel density estimation library as it is a mode finder. It includes the usual kernel bandwidth estimation methods and also supports subspace constrained mean shift, which finds edges/manifolds in noisy data. Support goes far beyond the typical Gaussian and Uniform kernels: It has ten kernel types, as well as the ability to combine them, with different kernels on different parts of a feature vector. The kernels include directional distributions, so it supports density estimation over the position and orientation of an object, for instance. It also supports the multiplication of density estimates, which allows you to perform non-parametric belief propagation using mean shift objects as the messages between random variables. Also has methods to approximate values such as the entropy of a density estimate, and the KL divergence between two estimates.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFA09B87-4EDC-47D8-B430-D0E2FDA3F3B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>At this point, we have no reliable information on the user basis of this library.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Mean Shift Library; 02/2016</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://reality.cs.ucl.ac.uk/projects/haines/haines16meanshift.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>This software allows a user to 1st train a statistical model of appearance, and 2nd to count the number of instances of that object.
