&lt;p>Nevertheless, the UK faces challenges in the ability to commercialise science. Britain has low R and D outside a few leading firms and a large proportion of R and D funded by foreign firms. Part of the problem is the 'funding gap' that British firms face at various stages of development, which is a serious impediment to realising the economic potential of publicly-funded science. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This funding gap differs among high-tech industries. In biotechnology, the gap is in late-stage funding, making UK biotech firms attractive acquisition targets for foreign firms. While there is much speculation about the funding gap, little is known about the effects of this funding gap on innovation. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research aims to understand what happens to the technological resources and assets of British science-based firms when acquired by foreign firms. Drawing on multiple case studies in Cambridge, Manchester and Oxford, the study derives different patterns of knowledge base combinations through acquisition that have different outcomes regarding innovation and important effects for the local science and technology system. &lt;/p>

This is an issue of gret importance to economic competitiveness of the UK. Discussions with practitioners and policymakers revolved around the way in which the multiple combinations of firms' technology and discovery and development capabilities have different effects on innovation. Also, awareness has been raised on how the relation between the complementarity/ similarity of the technology and of the discovery and development capabilities of the target and buyer firms and the buyers' ability to absorb the knowledge and capabilities play an important role in the further development of the acquired firm's technological assets and capabilities in the UK after acquisition. 

An important part of the discussion with practitioners and policymakers focused on how the cognitive, tacit knowledge embedded in scientists and specialists in universities, firms and laboratories provides the (national and regional) innovation system with unique competitive advantages and draws investment from both foreign and domestic firms. Awareness has been raised on the importance of investment in policies that support and develop these capabilities and networks that can strengthen the ability to appropriate value in these acquisitions. This involves not only proximity to universities, guaranteeing access to scientists, but involves a number of other features of a regional system of innovation and production.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CEF61C86-5866-4426-BB27-6D543EE47EEA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project's aim was to understand what happens to the technological resources and assets of UK science-based firms when acquired by foreign firms. We used a multiple case study research design, interviewed senior managers of UK biopharmaceutical firms and analysed patent data. We derived different patterns of knowledge base combinations through acquisition that have different outcomes in terms of innovation. These patterns are based on combinations of two factors: the complementarity or similarity of the technology, and the complementarity or similarity of the discovery and development capabilities of the target and acquiring firm. These combinations have clear differential outcomes in terms of investment in the acquired firm's technology and important effects for the local science and technology system. 

The scientific impact is three-fold: 
1) We make a theoretical contribution by advancing the discussion at a conceptual level, arguing that multiple combinations of firms' technology and discovery and development capabilities have different effects on the innovation performance of the acquired firm.
 
2) We extend the realm of inquiry on the effects of mergers and acquisitions to science-based firms. Previous literature has explored the relation between mergers and acquisitions and innovation for medium- and high-tech firms, which face different challenges from science-based firms.

3) We contribute methodologically by using a combination of interview and patent data. Previous studies rely primarily on patent analysis. We argue that in order to assess the relatedness of technology and discovery and development capabilities, careful analysis of interview and patent data is needed for each case.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project has developed some unique insights, particularly in relation to the knowledge base combinations through acquisition that have different outcomes in terms of innovation. 
Our findings also have important messages both for business leaders and policymakers, and we have sought to create awareness among practitioners and policymakers through workshops and discussions about what happens to the technological resources and assets of science-based firms when they are acquired by foreign firms. 
Our findings are also used in teaching, particularly in the Masters in Innovation Management and Entrepreneurship and MBA courses at Manchester Business School and Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences among others.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E0C2E6F1-236D-457B-874B-11D237F9CC98</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical
