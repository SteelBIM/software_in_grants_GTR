&lt;p>One-hundred 6-year-olds will participate in two studies testing whether exposure to oral narratives with a high ratio of subordinate clauses will lead to an increase in the use of these subordinates in their own retelling of similar narratives. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is divided into three phases:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>In phase 1 the children will be tested for their comprehension of words and of language structure through standardised tests. Their use of subordinates will also be tested through the elicitation of narratives. &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>In phase 2 the children will be divided into two groups: the experimental group will be exposed to narratives containing a high proportion of subordinate clauses; the control group will listen to narratives with a high ratio of coordinate clauses.&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>In the third and final phase the children will be tested again to evaluate whether the experimental group benefitted from the intensive exposure to subordinate clauses. &lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The hypothesis is that there should be a significant increase over time in the experimental group, but not in the control group. &lt;/p>

The second and third story were collected after the intervention phase, one week and ten weeks later respectively. The narratives were digitally audio-recorded and transcribed using the CHAT format specified in the CHILDES manual (MacWhinney, 2000).
