For women with preeclampsia currently available therapies improve the outcome of the illness, but the final cure only comes with delivery of the baby. Prompt delivery, preferably by the vaginal route rather than by caesarean section, is therefore vital to achieve good maternal and neonatal outcomes. There are various methods available to start the woman?s labour, and it is crucial that the method used is both effective and safe for mother and baby. This is especially important in low resource settings where the underlying illness is often severe and there are few facilities for monitoring the mother and baby. The World Health Organisation currently recommends two low cost options ? oral misoprostol (OM) tablets and transcervical Foley catheterisation (TFC). Whilst in the former method a tablet is swallowed every two hours, in the latter a thin rubber (?Foley?) catheter is threaded through the neck of the womb and held in place with a small inflated balloon at its tip. Although OM has been widely studied, it is infrequently used in India. Furthermore, there is comparatively little research on the TFC and the two methods have never been directly compared despite their great promise. Current evidence suggests that OM may be faster but sometimes ?overcontract? the uterus, whilst TFC may be slower but safer.

We propose a study to be conducted in two large government hospitals in Nagpur, India. 800 women with preeclampsia will be randomly allocated to use OM (25mcg tablets 2hrly) or TFC (size 18F with a 50ml balloon for 12 hours) for their induction. The main outcome is the attainment of vaginal delivery within 24 hours, and a variety of other measures of maternal and neonatal morbidity including cost effectiveness will also be collected. Currently 15% of mothers with preeclampsia suffer stillbirths in this setting ? this trial will also examine whether the use of the balloon catheter can reduce this.

Recruitment rates in a recent study of preeclamptic women using the same team and site demonstrate that 800 women can be recruited in 2 years. The study will be managed on a daily basis by the successful team of Dr Mundle in GMC Nagpur and Gynuity Health Projects, one of the most successful low-resource setting clinical trial specialists in the world.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Up to 80,000 pregnant women die annually from pre-eclampsia and eclampsia ? many of them in India where there are more maternal deaths than any other country. Current therapies reduce the morbidity associated with pre-eclampsia but the final cure only comes with delivery. Prompt delivery of the baby, preferably by the vaginal route following labour induction, is vital to achieve good maternal and neonatal outcomes. The need for an effective and safe induction method is especially important in low resource settings where the underlying illness is often severe and there are minimal facilities for monitoring of mother and baby. The WHO currently recommends one of two different interventions for low resource settings ? oral misoprostol (OM) and transcervical Foley catheterisation (TFC). Although OM has been widely studied, there is comparatively little research on the TCF. Neither are widely used and the two methods have never been directly compared. Current evidence suggests that OM may be faster but with more uterine hyperstimulation, whilst TFC may be slower but safer.

We propose an open label randomised trial of OM (25mcg tablets 2hrly) versus TFC (18F with 50ml balloon for 12 hours). The study will be conducted in two large government hospitals in Nagpur, India and will recruit women with preeclampsia who require induction of labour. Following informed consent, labour induction will be carried out using the selected method, followed by artificial membrane rupture and oxytocin infusion as required. The primary outcome is the attainment of vaginal delivery within 24 hours which is expected in 62% of women in the OM group. To detect an absolute reduction of 10% in this rate (i.e. 62% to 52%) with 80% power (two-sided a =0.05) we will require a sample of 768 women. This number will also have 80% power to detect a reduction in stillbirth rate from 15% (data from a recent study in the same site) to 8.5%. The secondary outcomes will include measures of maternal and neonatal morbidity up to the time of hospital discharge as well as a detailed economic evaluation.

Introduction Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains a major cause of maternal mortality and simple, low-cost, nonpharmacological therapies are urgently needed. Bimanual
uterine compression (BMC) is effective, but is both painful and intrusive. The PPH Butterfly is designed to make uterine compression much less invasive. This will expand access to PPH therapies and provide 'surgical treatment' at an early stage in the PPH process.Methods The PPH Butterfly was designed by a multidisciplinary team and reviewed by public and clinical focus groups during its development. The device was compared to standard BMC in a cross-over study. Twenty clinicians with previous experience of BMC, and 22 without conducted two forms of uterine compression in succession, each for 5 min. The order was randomly allocated. The mannequin (Noelle, Gaumard Ltd) was supplied with an 'atonic uterus', modified to allow BMC and to include a pressure sensor. This assessed the amount of intrauterine pressure produced by the participants' compression.
After regulatory approvals, the device was tested in healthy postpartum women.Results Users and focus groups found the PPH Butterfly device acceptable and easily used. In the mannequin studies there was huge interpersonal variation in the amount of pressure generated, but no significant difference between the two techniques or groups of users. With both methods, intrauterine pressures declined over the 5 min of use.Conclusion The PPH Butterfly is simple to use, even among obstetric care providers with little experience, and produces equivalent pressures to standard BMC.

Introduction 
Between 40 000 and 80 000 women die annually from hypertension in pregnancy. Prompt delivery, preferably by vaginal route, is vital for good maternal and neonatal outcomes.
Two low-cost interventions-oral misoprostol tablets and transcervical Foley catheterisation-are recommended for use in low-resource settings, but their relative risks and benefits are not known.
Methods In all, 602 women with a live fetus requiring delivery for pre-eclampsia or hypertension were randomly assigned to cervical ripening with oral misoprostol 25 lg every 2 hours
(maximum of 12 doses) or transcervical Foley catheter (size 18 F with 30-mL balloon). This remained until active labour started, the Foley catheter fell out, or 12 hours had elapsed. Induction continued with artificial membrane rupture and oxytocin. Funded by MRC.
Results More women in the misoprostol arm had a vaginal birth within 24 hours (57.0% versus 47.0%; P = 0.014). Women induced with misoprostol were more likely to have a vaginal birth (59.3% versus 49.7%; P = 0.017) and with a shorter time to delivery (771 min versus 861 min; P = 0.013). Oxytocin requirements were higher in the Foley arm. Rates of uterine hyperstimulation were very low in both groups (0.7% versus 0.3%; P = 0.566) and no differences were seen in neonatal morbidity. More women in the misoprostol group would use the same method in the future should they require another induction (82.8% versus 72.0%; P = 0.006).
Conclusion Oral misoprostol 25 lg was more effective and more acceptable to women than a transcervical Foley catheter for induction of labour in women requiring delivery because of preeclampsia or hypertension.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Women's Research Society(GLOW) Annual Conference, Manchester, UK.

This study looked at the &amp;quot;Induction of labour in pre-eclamptic women: a randomised trial comparing the Foley balloon catheter with oral misoprostol&amp;quot;. Pre-eclampsia remains a significant problem for pregnant women in low resource settings. Drug regimens can achieve some improvement but the best course of action with the best outcomes is prompt delivery of the baby. Prof Weeks gave a synopsis of the study primary and secondary objectives. setting of the research (Nagpur, India), number of women recruited and randomised to the study (602), the primary outcome measure (Attainment of vaginal delivery within 24 hours). This study told us that misoprostol is the more successful of the two methods tested from both the clincians' perspective and also from the women's perspective. Women were interviewed about their expectations before their induction commenced and were then re-interviewed within 48 hours of their delivery to ask for their opinions on the induction process, their labour and delivery and their perspective on each of the two technologies used and women were asked for their overall impression of the whole induction/delivery experience. The women were also asked to express their ideas on what they would like to see changed in any future inductions.
Professor Weeks applied to the MRC for further funding to take this research forward to look at what the best clinical care protocol will be for pre-eclamptic women again in Nagpur. The results of this application will be known later in 2017.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) World Congress, Vancouver, Canada October 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5CB556AD-C791-4CBF-9555-CEF284233602</gtr:id><gtr:impact>FIGO operates on a global level and is the only organisation that brings together professional societies of obstetricians and gynecologists on a global basis. Attendance at this conference had a two-fold purpose. The audience over the course of the 3 conference days attracts in excess of 1000 attendees, many operating at the highest levels of clinical practice and research within their own organisations. Therefore attendance and presentations made at this conference allows access to a significant number of fellow professionals who can go back and influence their policy and decision makers. Researchers can allow interact with fellow reserachers in bringing together ideas for further research. 

At the 2015 meeting in Vancouver we presented 2 posters - one giving the 'breaking' results of the INFORM study (we were too late to put the results in the submitted abstract and so were ineligible for an oral presentation) and the other giving a progress report on the development of the PPH Butterfly (device design and mannequin studies).

The second purpose of this visit was to meet with fellow investigators working on the INFORM project. This gave many members of the trial management group (TMG) attending the conference the opportunity to discuss issues face-to-face (members of the TMG are located in New York (USA) Nagput (India) and Liverpool (UK). The logistics of setting up a TMG for this study together with the travel costs usually makes regular face-to-face communication very difficult. The team could also spend a great deal of time discussing future plans in relation to a INFORM 2 study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at MRC Centenary event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0BA8CE61-A4A3-4FD7-9498-FC7D54B4626C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The talk was very well received and many people came up to me afterwards to chat about maternal health (as well as to try abdominal palpation on the mannequins).

The meeting was followed by a shared meal as a way of thanking the local team for their participation in the study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/680D8801-6A3E-4C49-8612-A6A162A34C5B"><gtr:id>680D8801-6A3E-4C49-8612-A6A162A34C5B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Simplifying oral misoprostol protocols for the induction of labour.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cc015ef2ddd0a3e10294dd731a6d42b0"><gtr:id>cc015ef2ddd0a3e10294dd731a6d42b0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weeks AD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1470-0328</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DD63A82E-1ADA-4780-9DE6-8DE4057DBE89"><gtr:id>DD63A82E-1ADA-4780-9DE6-8DE4057DBE89</gtr:id><gtr:title>Oral misoprostol for induction of labour.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Cochrane database of systematic reviews</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c82414dabe811d35aba7a3fc3b81b83a"><gtr:id>c82414dabe811d35aba7a3fc3b81b83a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Alfirevic Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1361-6137</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C33DCFE8-5813-4BFB-9051-DE5C087B34C6"><gtr:id>C33DCFE8-5813-4BFB-9051-DE5C087B34C6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/453c0cb175f156d881916f8b2190ab67"><gtr:id>453c0cb175f156d881916f8b2190ab67</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Polk J;
