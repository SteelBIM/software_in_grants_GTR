 Powerful ideas about European cultural origin stemming from the writings of classical authors who drew a distinction between 'civilization' and 'barbarism' have been used to contrast native peoples with Roman invaders. In Britain concepts of civilization and barbarism have influenced how people understand the extent and character of the territories that make up the UK, the origins of their inhabitants and how they relate to people from overseas. The Iron Age and Roman periods are highly popular in present-day Britain as demonstrated, for example, by the frequency and interest with which important archaeological discoveries are communicated via newspapers, magazines, television, films (e.g. 'Centurion' and 'The Eagle') and novels. Community projects focusing on the Iron Age are addressing themes such as housing and sustainable ways of living, while the Roman past offers opportunities for considering military identity, concepts of civilisation and multicultural origins (see the visual evidence). Ancient monuments dating to these periods and the museums that display them are popular visitor attractions. Re-enacting, metal-detecting and taking part in archaeological projects are generating new and relevant forms of knowledge. 
 Academic research on the Iron Age and Roman past in the UK is widely recognised across Europe and America for its excellence, but, until now, the exploration of meaning in the past has often been distanced from the interests and concerns of the broader public (Hingley 2015). This project offers the new perspective of studying the living meaning of Iron Age and Roman materials and ideas by examining the creative and variable ways in which stakeholders incorporate the past into their researches, performances and actions. We will also unpick the values of heritage that are specific to the Iron Age and Roman pasts from those that are not. Our methodologies will allow access to significant new bodies of information both online and offline. 
 We will communicate our findings in order to challenge the divisions that currently separate the interests of stakeholders, including (but not limited to) academic archaeologists, heritage managers, re-enactors, visitors to ancient monuments and teachers. We intend to promote our work by developing existing contacts with researchers and practitioners in archaeology, heritage and museums nationally and internationally. Drawing upon the project team's connections, we will exchange knowledge of our results through digital means, conferences, and publications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will provide benefits for:
 POLICY-MAKERS AND FUNDERS IN THE HERITAGE SECTOR (Historic England, Cadw, Historic Scotland, HLF, AHRC, etc.). Policy is gradually moving away from a narrow focus on conservation toward a greater appreciation of the importance of cultural heritage to individuals and communities (e.g. JPI 2014). Research has explored the cultural value of urban and industrial landscapes but approaches regarding ancient monuments generally remain focused on protection. This would seem to be a particularly timely opportunity to influence policy with the creation of English Heritage/Historic England. The perspectives and materials to be developed (Outputs 9, 11) will build upon PI's experience from the 'Tales of the Frontier' project (Hingley 2012), and on the work the present team have undertaken on digital heritage and ethnography.
 ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND HERITAGE MANAGERS WORKING IN LOCAL AND NATIONAL MUSEUMS AND OPEN-AIR MUSEUMS. We will communicate a more coordinated and nuanced interpretation of IA&amp;amp;RH that can be drawn upon at monuments and museums. Only limited research has been undertaken to examine the ways that these places interpret the past, we intend to provide academic support for the development of future initiatives (Outputs 6, 9-10).
 ARCHAEOLOGISTS WORKING IN LOCAL MUSEUMS, COUNCILS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL UNITS INVOLVED WITH COMMUNITY PROJECTS either in a managing role or as advisors. There is relatively little synthetic research that addresses the community initiatives funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund or other organizations including AHRC. A set of archaeological guidelines (HLF 2013) focuses on excavation and recording only. This study will provide a fuller assessment of the contributions made by community groups to archaeology which should help justify the resources and to communicate the important role of archaeologists (Output 10). 
 COMMUNITY GROUPS AND DIGITAL COMMUNITIES with an interest in IA&amp;amp;RH. A number of community projects draw upon archaeological research, (re)construction and living history and we will provide a more informed understanding of the range and character of such work (Output 10). This should help to support the growth of new and existing communities initiatives offline and online (Output 7). 
 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO VISIT IA&amp;amp;RH places (ancient monuments, open-air museums and museums). Output 9 will be freely available on the Internet that will itemize, communicate and interpret places in public ownership and the range of values that stakeholders attribute to these. 
 STORYTELLERS, RE-ENACTORS, DRUIDS AND PAGANS. Archaeologists are often critical of the heritage created by these groups, but by taking a more open approach we seek to communicate and promote a coordinated agenda that draws upon their activities and attitudes to create a broader range of concepts of heritage (Outputs 5-11).
 TEACHERS IN SCHOOLS who teach the IA and Roman past can currently draw upon a range of digital sources, some of which are free of charge and others not. We will provide a synthesis of these data sets and will emphasize the importance of IA&amp;amp;RH in school education (archaeology currently remains fairly marginal to the curriculum). The potential to address issues of mobility and frontiers is clearly indicated by existing teaching packs and community projects and we aim to provide an academic context for the educational themes by exploring the potential of IA and Roman places (Output 8).
 DIGITAL ENGAGEMENT PRACTITIONERS working in the heritage and museum sectors. The digital technologies and online platforms that we seek to develop (Outputs 3, 7) aim to provide models for future research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-10-16</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>689801</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture at 'Celtic Classical Conference' in Oxford in June 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>144F371C-9BA2-462F-97B6-B59CFEC6D327</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk on Hadrian's Wall at Celtic Classical Conference in Oxford on the inclusive and divisive uses of Hadrian's Wall in the past decade.

The CI working on digital heritage was appointed then (Chiara Bonacchi). The PDRA undertaking the ethnographic work was appointed in October 2016 (Dr Kate Sharpe). We have been scoping the digital and ethnographic research that is to be undertaken on the project and have been working hard to co-ordinate research in Durham and University College London, where the project members are based. Initially, we have been working on a range of themes to focus upon with regard to the development of the two halves of the project, developing existing contacts with project partners, designing the website and some initial research on digital heritage. We seem to be about on target according to the schedule set out in our application, so have answered 'yes' to the next question. Evidently, the findings recorded on the web are provisional only at this early stage in the project. We have a workshop organised for the Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference in March 2017 and a session accepted for the European Archaeological Association in September 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The digital aspect of the project on the website noted above is actively seeking input from anyone that wishes to contribute. We are designing the research through discussion with heritage practitioners in national heritage agencies, museums and open-air museums to ensure that our results are of value and to arrange access to audiences.
