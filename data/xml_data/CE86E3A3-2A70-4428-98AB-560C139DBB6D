Thus, for example, if the general situation for workers improves, it may be that a firm seeking to hire new workers feels it needs to pay more to new hires; the supposition is that in fact the firm cannot bring in new workers at a higher wage than it is paying to its existing workers, so it would either have to raise the wage of the incumbents, or not offer as much as it would like to attract new workers. It is hypothesised that wages will be less variable and employment considerably more variable than if labour markets behaved like markets which satisfy the usual laws of supply and demand. Detailed data on individual wages will also be used to try to gauge to what extent this equal treatment is a feature of actual labour markets. The data is drawn from two datasets, one from Portugal and the other from Brazil. Each dataset provide objective records on millions of workers matched with firms over a number of years.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274382</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Equal treatment, worker replacement and wage rigidity</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:id>4E5BA55A-8004-43CD-A2B1-D736242A098C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at the Bank of Spain, 19th October 2011</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project aimed to build formal theoretical models of how wages and employment evolve when firms cannot pay discriminate (or can only discriminate to a limited extent). It is indisputable that pay relativities within organisations matter. There is much anecdotal evidence that, in many occupations, a worker might be especially put out to find out that a similarly qualified colleague is being paid at a higher rate. Understanding this phenomenon may well be more a matter of psychology than of economic theory. 
Our research suggests that wages will be less variable and employment considerably more variable than if labour markets behave like markets for other commodities. The reasoning is as follows. When a firm is hiring new workers, conventional supply and demand analysis suggests that if the labour market is tight, say, with low supply of workers or high demand, the price (wage) will to rise to bring supply and demand into balance. If, however, the firm cannot pay newly hired workers at different rates from existing workers, the analysis is very different. In these circumstances, the firm wants to pay a high rate to new workers because the market is tight and it will also have to pay existing workers at this high rate. This could be very costly if the existing workers would have been content to work at lower rates without new hires. This also means that the firm has an incentive not to raise wages as far as it would do in the normal supply-demand analysis, so wages do not respond fully to normal market signals. 
The same happens when the labour market is slack in downturns: the firm could potentially hire at lower wages but these new hires would not be content to work alongside better paid but otherwise similar employees. The firm could cut the wage of incumbents to match that of the new hires, but there are reasons why this is difficult. One possibility we will investigate is that incumbents do not want a wage which fluctuates greatly in line with market conditions, but instead would prefer more stability. We find that the firm prefers to maintain the wage close to its previous level and bring in new hires at this higher rate even though it is paying more than necessary to attract the new workers.
We also investigated the extent to which this equal treatment phenomenon can be detected a detailed dataset from Portugal, and we found evidence to support the idea that wages of new hires do not vary markedly more over the business cycle than those of incumbent workers.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that the main area would be in academic research. The project has developed dynamic models of equal treatment, where cohorts of new hires to a firm cannot be treated independently of incumbents. Simple, tractable equilibria have been derived. These models behave very differently to comparable models in which employers can bargain independently with each new cohort of workers, exhibiting less flexible wages and more variable unemployment. We also developed the methodological point that panel estimates of tenure specific sensitivity of wages to the business cycle are subject to likely biases in the presence of equal treatment of workers. In particular, canonical variables used in the literature such as the minimum unemployment rate during a worker's time at the firm and the current unemployment rate interacted with a new hire dummy can be significant even in an extreme case when each worker in the firm receives the same wage, regardless of tenure (equal treatment). This means that conclusions typically drawn based on such estimates about the nature of contracting and the variability of wages over the business cycle of different cohorts of workers, are potentially suspect. In matched data the problem can be resolved by the inclusion in the panel of firm-year interaction fixed effects to eliminate the common wage components within each firm. The project has also developed a simple methodology for calculating how the wages of the cohort of new hires responds to the business cycle.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>01BC528D-6EC6-4A48-91FC-0C8940B84197</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.econ.ed.ac.uk/papers/focus_papers/School_FocusPaper03.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6D0AC575-C7F2-4014-83C8-8801AD12EE7E"><gtr:id>6D0AC575-C7F2-4014-83C8-8801AD12EE7E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Equal treatment, worker replacement and wage rigidity</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Bank of Spain</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ef119a1aecba09e6e761fd44f5352122"><gtr:id>ef119a1aecba09e6e761fd44f5352122</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell, A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/55AEF735-135E-4860-8F48-D95AB2FD9C04"><gtr:id>55AEF735-135E-4860-8F48-D95AB2FD9C04</gtr:id><gtr:title>Downward Wage Rigidity in a Model of Equal Treatment Contracting*</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Scandinavian Journal of Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4b3f694f615ee3cadf2e83aeae1b6dd6"><gtr:id>4b3f694f615ee3cadf2e83aeae1b6dd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martins P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5162B5F5-3249-4B95-A95F-E1EC0742615C"><gtr:id>5162B5F5-3249-4B95-A95F-E1EC0742615C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Labor Contracts, Equal Treatment, and Wage-Unemployment Dynamics</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3fe73e6e5e1753ac774e6d40571c73c6"><gtr:id>3fe73e6e5e1753ac774e6d40571c73c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/499A5D04-81A7-40BA-BE51-3C276CAA6B15"><gtr:id>499A5D04-81A7-40BA-BE51-3C276CAA6B15</gtr:id><gtr:title>Measuring What Employers Really Do about Entry Wages over the Business Cycle</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4b3f694f615ee3cadf2e83aeae1b6dd6"><gtr:id>4b3f694f615ee3cadf2e83aeae1b6dd6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Martins P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/33FF5AE4-0BC5-4C5C-A755-5A7883B1A09A"><gtr:id>33FF5AE4-0BC5-4C5C-A755-5A7883B1A09A</gtr:id><gtr:title>A COMPETITIVE MODEL OF WORKER REPLACEMENT AND WAGE RIGIDITY</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Economic Inquiry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3fe73e6e5e1753ac774e6d40571c73c6"><gtr:id>3fe73e6e5e1753ac774e6d40571c73c6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Snell A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8A4032CF-092A-45A1-A217-37A470660A1C"><gtr:id>8A4032CF-092A-45A1-A217-37A470660A1C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Skills, mismatch and inequality : labour market frictions and costly technology</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/165088ab5a94f1ce2d61addae6afc631"><gtr:id>165088ab5a94f1ce2d61addae6afc631</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Richard Holt (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-0546</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/E020623/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp;
