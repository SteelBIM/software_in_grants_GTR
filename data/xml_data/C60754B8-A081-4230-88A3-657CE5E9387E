After a brief spell of violence in 1991/2, the de-facto state of Transnistria came into being, and despite numerous settlement proposals from all parties involved in the so-called 5+2 settlement process, the status quo of 1992 has been consolidated and, until recently, no tangible progress was made towards a settlement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Following a German-Russian initiative, the parties agreed in September 2011 to resume official negotiations in the 5+2 framework. Unfortunately, the conflict parties lack a wider understanding of good practices and how the issues that they are dealing with have been resolved in other countries. Furthermore, some of the mediators lack knowledge of past attempts to resolve the Transnistria issue and are unfamiliar with the complexities of the situation on the ground and how similar negotiation processes have successfully concluded elsewhere. Against this background, this project follows on from two previous research projects that the PI conducted on the establishment and sustainability of governance arrangements in divided societies, especially the use of autonomy and power-sharing arrangements.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The intended beneficiaries of the proposed follow-on project are: the Government of the Republic of Moldova, especially the Bureau for Reintegration (GoM); the authorities of Transnistria, especially the Chief Negotiator and his team (AoT); the European Union, especially the Moldova desk in the EEAS and the Delegation in Chisinau (EU); the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, especially the Mission to Moldova (OSCE); Her Majesty's Government, especially the British Embassy in Moldova, the Eastern Research Group, and the relevant thematic and country desks (HMG); and the Government of Germany, especially the Foreign Ministry and the Chancellery (GoG). All stakeholders will have opportunities to have direct and continuing input into the direction and substance of the intended outputs, thus ensuring their relevance. This multistage engagement will also enhance the quality of relationships with stakeholders and thus increase the potential of achieving lasting impact.

Through an initial stakeholder consultation on existing settlement preferences, the discussion of draft option papers with stakeholders, and the presentation of the two finalised option papers to stakeholders individually and in groups, the intended beneficiaries will all become aware of the full range of options for a settlement of the Transnistrian conflict and their respective implications. 

Related to this, and specifically for the GoM and AoT, it is expected that impact will also include that the sides move away from their currently entrenched focus on 'labels' (e.g., unitary state vs. confederation), obtain better informed negotiation positions/strategies, focus on individual issues that need to be resolved as a way of building towards a comprehensive settlement, and build sustainable institutions and mutual relationships (partially as a result of additional peer-learning opportunities created in the final stage of the project when completed options papers are presented to all stakeholders at the concluding conference in Vienna).

For the EU, OSCE, HMG, and the GoG, an additional expectation of impact is that they become aware of a full set of options for pursuing their efforts to mediate a conflict settlement and to contribute to its implementation and accordingly shape/modify their current strategies to facilitate a negotiated settlement between GoRM and AoT. It is also expected that they will transfer generalizable options and policy recommendations from each paper to other conflict situations that they are currently dealing with or might be dealing with in the future so that the key policy outputs of the proposed project have a legacy effect in terms of adding to institutional knowledge and understanding on third-party conflict management. 

Impact generation through transfer of generalizable options and policy recommendations will additionally be facilitated through a wide range of circulated briefing papers (for example on confidence-building measures, settlement options, guarantee mechanisms, reintegration challenges) which will provide non-academic users with readily accessible information in a specialist area of knowledge and further their understanding of the complexities of the conflict settlement process and the contribution they can make to it. Dissemination of these briefing papers will happen through the networks of the PI and his project collaborators, including the Governance and Social Development Resource Centre (based at the University of Birmingham) with its direct links to UK governance advisers and the Stabilisation Unit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>72450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Special Status: Can the Moldovan-Transnistrian Conundrum be Resolved by Consociational Democracy?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5D7646BF-C00F-4C46-90D0-326ADE9A447A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a co-authored working paper on which I based my talk at Uppsala University in December 2013 and subsequent briefings for officials in the Moldovan government, the OSCE (Vienna and Chisinau), the EU EEAS and EU Delegation to Moldova, and the British FCO.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Progress Stalls on Moldova-Transnistria Conflict</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>171ED699-D1C5-4C13-99B6-7F874F147C4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a Briefing for World Politics Review offering an assessment of the situation in the Moldova-Transnistria conflict after the collapse of the Moldovan government on 5 March 2013.

I have also worked extensively with the Government of Moldova, especially the State Chancellery and the Bureau for Reintegration within it.

In late 2015, I was engaged by the EU Delegation in Chisinau to write (with three co-authors) a draft a report on a law for the transitional framework of the Transnistrian conflict settlement process. 

In July 2016, I hosted a delegation of the Moldovan government at the University of Birmingham for an intensive one-week training on conflict resolution strategy. The delegation was led by the country's deputy prime minister with responsibility for reintegration.

Throughout 2016 and since early 2017 I have also worked with the German and then Austrian chairmanships of the OSCE on the Transistrian settlement process and co-authored a paper on trade as a confidence-building measure the findings of which featured prominently in a report (http://osce-network.net/file-OSCE-Network/documents/Protracted_Conflicts_OSCE_WEB.pdf) by the OSCE Network of Thinktanks and Academic Institutions presented at the 2016 OSCE Ministerial Meeting in Hamburg, Germany.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>ADB5EC15-AA3D-496B-B176-1AEE69E5C9FE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Being funded under the follow-on scheme, this project did not generate any new research per se, but applied existing knowledge and understanding to the conflict over Transnistria in Moldova. In so doing, I engaged with all relevant stakeholders in the Moldovan government and the Transnistrian authorities up to the level of Deputy Prime Minister and Chief Negotiator/Foreign Minister, respectively, and with officials in the EU and OSCE, as well as the FCO and the foreign ministries of Germany, Ukraine, Sweden, Finland and the United States.



As a result of these discussions (see further under exploitation routes, below) I gained additional knowledge and understanding of the complexity of this particular conflict and its associated mediation process. In particular, it became clear that the negotiation process suffered from three deficiencies: conflicting priorities among the mediators/guarantors/observers (EU, US, OSCE, Ukraine, Russia), and particularly Russian reluctance to move towards a discussion of political/status issues; lack of a clear strategy and an understanding of the implications of specific bilateral policies on the part of the EU (especially related to the proposed Association Agreement with Moldova); and a lack of capacity on the part of the Moldovan government to engage systematically and strategically with the negotiation process.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have consulted widely to all parties involved in the Moldova-Transnistria conflict resolution process and am continuing to do so. This has included briefings and presentations to the European Parliament, the EU Delegation in Moldova, the EU External Action Service in Brussels, the foreign ministries and embassies in Moldova of the UK, Germany, Sweden, and the United States, the OSCE Mission in Moldova, the OSCE Conflict Prevention Centre in Vienna, and the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities.



As a spin-off of these activities and based on the insights gained as part of this project, I am now running a series of workshops for the Moldovan government on increasing conflict resolution capacity (especially negotiation strategy), have advised the the EU Special Representative on Georgia and presented at an information session for the Geneva Discussions on Georgia, and produced two chapters for the Geneva-based HD Centre's mediation handbook (see outputs). As detailed under outputs, one peer-reviewed journal article has already been published, and I have given several invited talks based on my work under this grant, including at Princeton, LSE, and Uppsala University (see outcomes section). I am currently working on a further journal article (based on my Uppsala lecture) and a book manuscript.



I am also using findings from the project in my teaching, especially in my MA course on post-conflict peacebuilding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BD1D19E6-7DB0-4CDA-9474-1C15511CFBC7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.stefanwolff.com/projects/conflict-resolution-in-moldova</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE597CEB-954A-4C85-9561-2E3036A6070C"><gtr:id>BE597CEB-954A-4C85-9561-2E3036A6070C</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Transnistrian Issue: Moving Beyond the Status-Quo</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/431612150bd64e1897c201173db82658"><gtr:id>431612150bd64e1897c201173db82658</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wolff Stefan</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CE9F3DBA-C2A6-452F-B3AD-60E41020C0A0"><gtr:id>CE9F3DBA-C2A6-452F-B3AD-60E41020C0A0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Linkage and leverage effects on Moldova's Transnistria problem</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>East European Politics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d22c3e8125d18cce7019a5eb8793b045"><gtr:id>d22c3e8125d18cce7019a5eb8793b045</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Beyer J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J020710/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4CC238CE-229E-47B9-A4BD-01A3E3C7000C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Diplomacy &amp; Internat Relations</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F7EEE6CD-E283-4BAB-BA5E-70B4B0F1F1A6</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Political Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
