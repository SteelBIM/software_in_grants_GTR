Yet older people's work is disregarded through uninformed policy and planning; exposing older people to policy shifts that can threaten their livelihoods and undermine their rights as workers and their right to development under the UN Convention on the Right to Development. This follow-on project will update research on recent developments in older people?s livelihoods. The findings will be disseminated in easily accessible formats that will spur a widespread public debate on policy with a view to building a broad campaign to safeguard livelihood rights in old age. To do this a project team, comprising academics and campaigners for old age and social justice, will develop a range of materials that will be circulated to policy makers, opinion shapers, civil society organisations, United Nations agencies and the public.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will benefit a range of non-academic and academic users

The non-academic impact will occur at local, national and international levels and will benefit policy-makers, within international, national, local government agencies, campaigners, activists, law makers, administrators and the judiciary as well as the wider public, the urban poor and the urban poor in particular.

The impact will take the form of:
1) demonstrating pervasive age discrimination and stereotyping that strips older people of their rights as citizens and workers.
2) spurring the reconceptualisation of older people's capacities and contributions to the economy and society across a wide range of contexts (policy and planning, implementation, interpretations of the law).
3) opening up new avenues around old age in emerging and on-going campaigns, including in campaigns against the shift from in-kind welfare support to cash transfers, the setting of the poverty line, slum relocation and the squeeze on street markets.
4) creating a more positive discourse on the inter-generational relations amongst the urban poor which may in turn generate a more wholistic understanding of the cumulative pressures on the urban poor arising from economic and social transformations and their policy roots.
5) demonstrating the benefits of collaboration between researchers and campaigners 
6) demonstrating the value of using compelling, easily accessible and assimilated methods to spread radically new perspectives to mass and targeted audiences.

The academic impact comprises:
a) enhancing the knowledge economy by providing new knowledge on impact of significant pension rate increases on the work participation of the older working poor in a developing city context. 
b) the development and utilisation of new and innovative methodologies, techniques and cross-disciplinary and cross-sector partnerships for disseminating findings on the economic contribution of older people, including the development of visual and audio-visual materials and tool kit.
c) training highly skilled researchers in Chennai with the capacity to work between the academic and policy sectors.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>82029</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>HelpAge India</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>2013 Documentary launch and exhibition of photo essay</gtr:description><gtr:id>20AC3769-481F-4BE8-9C4D-9A351B1F67E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1.

1. It is difficult to ascertain the impact of a particular blog but the fact that HelpAge International are willing to host such a blog demonstrates that they consider this research important in supporting their own work - at this time the development of the Global Age Watch Index with UNDP and others for which, one index, on older workers is controversial from a high income country perspective but a reality and a necessity in low and middle income countries. Global Age Watch Index was launched in 2014.

Print media and India has used the outputs of this award to spread awareness of the role of older people in the economy and the shortfall in older people's rights as citizens and workers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2B3496A3-A8AA-492D-AE4F-C23009F80ACE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant was an ESRC Follow-on grant for expanding the impact of funded research (ES/F016077/1, 2007-2010) which was graded as 'very good'. The aim of this project was to generate materials that could extend the research impact into North India and abroad. This necessitated finding a means of disseminating the research in an accessible manner and of demonstrating its validity beyond the confines of its original setting, the low-income settlements of India's fourth largest city, Chennai. The outputs comprised the making of two documentaries, 'We're Still Working' (17 mins, English and Hindi versions), 'The Forgotten Generation' (40 mins); the development and exhibition of a photo essay on older workers in India; the development of a campaign toolkit and project website. The award also included up-dating earlier research with a study of what difference the State of Tamil Nadu's 125% increase in the social pension, in 2011, made to older people's lives. 

The project produced a photo essay of forty-four A2 photographs and associated text which was very well received in the UK and India. It was taken up by two national level campaigning networks in India that campaign for food security and civil rights, the Right to Food Campaign and the Pension Parishad for their rallies, conventions and conferences. Through these activities the photo essay was seen by the public, social activists, academics, policy makers, UN personnel and the media and spurred the emerging recognition both that older people make vital contributions to the Indian economy, despite ageism and age discrimination, and that their rights as workers and citizens are not being met.

The project produced the two very well received documentaries in conjunction with an award winning director, Deepa Dhanraj and cinematographer Navroze Contractor, which are available on vimeo and have also been circulated to Non-government organisations in the UK and South Asia, the latter through the support of HelpAge India and other NGOs. 

In the final months of the research the project approached The Hindu, one of India's leading English language newspapers, to run a 'national level photo competition on the working elderly'. The first objective was to get an idea of how extensive is older people's work across India and of what kinds of work they do. The second objective was to raise awareness of older people as workers. The third was to establish a long-term on-line gallery of older workers. The photo competition was supported with a six week campaign in The Hindu and by a social media campaign. Nearly 3,000 photographs of older people working across India and in a very wide range of activities were submitted and over 34,000 votes were cast for the 'people's choice' prize. This proved a highly effective and evocative means of gathering data and this data did support the 2007-10's project findings that older people do work and vast numbers of them work in the most insecure and most lowly paid sectors of the economy.

The research into the impact of pension increase found that 125% increase in the pension level did not relieve older people of the need to work. It did, however, give them some sense of security, allowing them to buy more of the medicine or food that they needed. The research found that because pension values were not linked to inflation their real value rapidly declined such that by 2014 the pension rise had done little more than bring older people's real incomes back to where they were in 2008. However, by comparison to most of India, where pension incomes have remained unchanged since 2008, hence fallen by half in real terms, this is a considerable improvement.

All the materials continue to find new users, most recently by the International Federation of Ageing.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings and outputs are readily available on the internet. They are actively being made available to NGOs (HelpAge International, Age International) in the UK, India (Right to Food Campaign, Pension Parishad) and to global networks, such as the International Federation on Ageing, which are using them to further their thinking and their advocacy and campaign work with policy makers, Parliamentarians and UN agencies. 

The work is also being taken up by the emerging field of global ageing within the wider ageing/gerontological studies in the UK and USA and in Development Studies teaching in the UK.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0466A694-FB7D-4ED4-89CC-CA7759D6209E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F6BD1B01-12EE-47C5-B7B7-DC6845664B91"><gtr:id>F6BD1B01-12EE-47C5-B7B7-DC6845664B91</gtr:id><gtr:title>Forgotten Generation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/038ad9f070136d4dd7f6dc5827c12028"><gtr:id>038ad9f070136d4dd7f6dc5827c12028</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vera-Sanso, P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1A12A48E-865B-4BE9-999A-1F8CEA70173E"><gtr:id>1A12A48E-865B-4BE9-999A-1F8CEA70173E</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Health Costs of Bolstering the Indian Economy</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Global Ageing Issues &amp;
