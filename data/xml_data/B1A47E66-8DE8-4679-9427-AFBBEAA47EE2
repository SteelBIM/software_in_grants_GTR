1879-1914</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/I021671/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research project explores the histories and legacies of British investment in Chilean nitrate mines and involvement in its global trafficking. Through an examination of sites, artefacts and images, the project will trace nitrate's route from natural mineral state processed in the oficinas (works) of the Atacama desert through transported commodity and stock market exchange value to become, ultimately, part of the material and symbolic inheritances of London mansions and of estates in the capital's surrounding countryside. It undertakes new audio and visual documentation of geographically disparate but historically connected landscapes, remote nitrate fields and metropolitan financial districts, accompanied by an analysis of nitrate's material and visual culture. \n\nAs a basic ingredient of both fertilizers and explosives, nitrate was intimately connected with the industrialization of life and death, yet an account of its production and trade, including the pivotal role played by British merchant houses and adventure capitalists, is quite unfamiliar beyond specific research communities devoted to Latin America economic development. Thus, the project entitled Traces of Nitrate, directly addresses a lack of historical understanding and cultural awareness of the significance of the nitrate industry by disseminating its research through a photographic exhibition, video installation, programme of public events as well as scholarly publications aimed at interest groups in and outside the university sector. Seeking to uncover the extent to which a once highly prized mineral was at the centre of the relationship between Britain and Chile between 1879 and 1914 and how, in this period between the beginning of the Pacific War and the outbreak of the First World War, it was connected to fortunes of City of London, ports of Liverpool, Pisagua and Iquique, the research will also locate nitrate within a process of globalization shaped not only by the expansion of consumer culture but also by the extraction and depletion of non-renewable resources. \n\nThe 'trace' of the project's title thus refers to a process of delineation as well as to the objects of inquiry: the physical remains. Their transformation over time will be carefully mapped to create 'biographies' of nitrate artefacts, paying close attention to how mineral wealth has been collected or allowed to disappear and to the preservation or regeneration of twentieth century landscapes of finance. Sustained archival research will enable the identification of particular places and objects but these records of nitrate industry (for example, photographs within the Fondo Fotogr&amp;aacute;fico Fundaci&amp;oacute;n Universidad de Navarra or papers of Antony Gibbs and Son, Guildhall Library) will be also scrutinized as representations that deploy categories of the 'foreign' or 'familiar', define land as a commodity or as a nation and cast the character of the financial investor or identity of nitrate miner. Assembling and analyzing these spatial, visual and material records will indicate where British and Chilean histories converge and separate allowing insights into the selective process of remembering and forgetting the past.\nTraces of Nitrate engages with three fields of current academic inquiry: visual cultures of colonialism; contemporary photographic practice; the material culture and heritage of conflict. Its scope is dependent upon the different expertise of Ribas (PI) and Purbrick (Co-I) in documentary photography and the interpretation of visual and material culture, respectively, and their overlapping interest in the investigation of contested spaces and unequally shared legacies. As part of the project, they will jointly supervise a doctoral student. Traces of Nitrate is conducted in collaboration with partners in Chile, Spain and Britain: Universidad UNIACC, Santiago, Universidad de Navarra, Pamplona, Virreina Centre de la Imatge, Barcelona, Open Eye Gallery, Liverpool.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>International exchange and cultural understanding\nA long term aim of the Traces of Nitrate project is to increase understanding of international interconnections across Britain and Chile; it is thus appropriate that the development of the research and its dissemination is based on cultivation of relationships between educational and cultural institutions based in the European and American continents. That four partners (Universidad UNIACC, Universidad de Navarra, Virreina Centre de la Imatge, Open Eye Gallery) have agreed to participate in and support the project is evidence of confidence that it will bring economic, educational and cultural benefits to their institutions and the communities they serve in Chile, Spain and Britain. Our partnership will develop through sharing local, subject specialist knowledge and professional expertise; it is characterised by an international reciprocity that will ensure that benefits are spread across the project. Knowledge transfer is embedded in the research process: the documentation in Chile will develop a working relationship with UNIACC; the curating of the touring exhibition will be a collaborative effort with Virreina Centre de Imatge. The planning of conferences and public events at Universidad de Navarra and the Open Eye Gallery will place local collections and regional images within in global histories creating a dialogue between institutions that will extend to their audiences. \nCultural engagement: addressing different publics \nTouring exhibition\nPublic exhibitions are cultural events that provide a space in which people can explore histories and identities. They are key tools for making research available without precondition, such as enrolment in an educational programme. Traces of Nitrate will address a general audience at each of its tour venues (Barcelona, Brighton, Santiago, Liverpool) and a series of related events will involve a wide range of specific interest groups in each location, including, for example, local historians and archaeologists, photographers, artists, art critics, heritage professionals, families of former nitrate miners and Latin American communities in Britain. English-Spanish and Spanish-English translation will facilitate both public and interest group participation. Furthermore, as well as providing access to new research in arts and humanities and enabling participation in educational forums, Traces of Nitrate will contribute to creative economies and community development in the manner typical of public exhibitions.\nWebsite communities\nA project website is an integral part of the process making research widely available and fulfils the responsibility for openness expected of any publicly funded project. An important function of the Traces of Nitrate website will be to facilitate contact between university researchers and practitioners and those outside the university sector encouraging the participation of English and Spanish speaking on-line communities devoted to advancing discussion about the interpretation of contemporary heritage and development of sites of conflict, the use of photography. The website will also be used to house a digital archive of the touring exhibition and its related events, extending their impact beyond their immediate local audience. \nDeveloping Heritage Policies and Practices\nHeritage is an important point of popular access to history. Participants in the field of heritage are diverse, encompassing tourists, local activists seeking conservation or re-development, heritage managers and policy-makers. All play a part in the stewardship of the historic environment and their ability to learn, explain, record or protect it will be enhanced through the creation of new visual documentation and historical information relating to the heritage of the nitrate trade in Britain and Chile and its specific sites in the Atacama</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>264357</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Group exhibition of works curated by Matt Packer at the Treignac Project in France (http://treignacprojet.tumblr.com/post/84122572895/o-chair-o-flesh-25-may-29-september-2013).

The works interrogate a number of events and documents construed as distant echoes, in the recent history of Chile, Great Britain and Spain, of the detonations in the late 19th and early 20th century nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert. The series is an appendix to Ribas' long term project Nitrate, presented in 2014 at the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona [MACBA], and conjures up a wide network of interconnected geographies and histories, of personal and collective memories on the distinctive political contexts of Spain and Chile around 1973, and on historical relationships between Chile and Great Britain - Ribas' country of residence since 2000 - which are at the heart of the Nitrate project. For both bodies of work, the Atacama Desert operates as a vanishing point.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E17A79C-8BF8-413E-86C2-4EA103E84B4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Exhibition review in Frieze: http://www.frieze.com/issue/review/xavier-ribas/

The works interrogate a number of events and documents construed as distant echoes, in the recent history of Chile, Great Britain and Spain, of the detonations in the late 19th and early 20th century nitrate fields of the Atacama Desert. The series is an appendix to Ribas' long term project Nitrate, presented in 2014 at the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona [MACBA], and conjures up a wide network of interconnected geographies and histories, of personal and collective memories on the distinctive political contexts of Spain and Chile around 1973, and on historical relationships between Chile and Great Britain - Ribas' country of residence since 2000 - which are at the heart of the Nitrate project. For both bodies of work, the Atacama Desert operates as a vanishing point.</gtr:description><gtr:id>25E9B262-7185-4BEE-B977-BDC875A7B083</gtr:id><gtr:impact>On the occasion of the exhibition I was invited to do a talk about the work at the Universitat Polit&amp;egrave;cnica de Val&amp;egrave;ncia: http://cargocollective.com/tracesofnitrate/filter/Events/2015-Universitat-Politecnica-de-Valencia

The research continues to attract interest and several publications and exhibitions are in process. 

The research is now part of World of Matter (http://www.worldofmatter.net), a multimedia project providing an open access archive on the global ecologies of resource exploitation and circulation, and Temporary School of Experimental Geography (http://tsoeg.org), an itinerant network of artists sharing ideas and responses to landscape through fieldwork.
