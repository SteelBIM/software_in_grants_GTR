Research into memory is particularly important as it gives us our sense of identity. Deficits in learning and memory occur in many diseases, injuries and during aging. Identifying the key molecules involved in these processes, will help reveal targets for new therapeutic interventions to reverse the devastating consequences of memory loss, this research is particularly important for our aging population. The brain consists of many cells or neurons that communicate via connections called synapses. Information flows through neurons via small electrical impulses, a bit like a computer. At most synapses these electrical impulses cause release of chemicals that bind to the output neuron causing it to become more excitable and propagate the electrical impulse to the next neuron in the circuit. The brain also stores information during learning and retrieves it as memory. There are special parts of the brain for learning e.g. the hippocampus. When an animal experiences learning stimuli there is a persistent increase in synaptic transmission between hippocampal neurons called Long Term Potentiation (LTP), this increase continues after the original stimulus is removed and is a synaptic mechanism for learning. These long-term changes in synaptic activity can cause increases in synaptic growth and connections between neurons, a process called synaptic plasticity that is thought to be a synaptic mechanism of memory. LTP and learning is initiated by calcium (Ca2+) entering the neuron and activating an enzyme called Ca2+ responsive kinase (CaMKII). CaMKII is abundant in the brain, constituting 1-2% of its total protein and is one of the main synaptic proteins. Once activated by increased Ca2+, CaMKII is able to cause a switch in its own activity so that it remains active even after Ca2+ has gone down. This special ability of CaMKII to maintain its own activity has been termed 'the molecular memory switch' and is required for both LTP and learning. CaMKII then regulates the activity of other proteins at the synapse that together maintain the increased synaptic transmission of LTP. In addition CaMKII activity can lead to many of the other changes occurring during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These CaMKII mediated changes in synaptic plasticity are required for learning and memory in most animals including Drosophila. Although fruitflies are small they are smart, for instance they can land on the ceiling and detect that fruit in your fruit bowl has gone off before you can. In this proposal we wish to study CaMKII-mediated synaptic mechanisms of learning and memory further taking advantage of powerful genetics of Drosophila. One important question we wish to answer is: How is CaMKII's activity regulated and localised at synapses during learning? We have found that in flies like in mammals, at inactive synapses with low levels of Ca2+, CaMKII can regulate its own activity by a second mechanism that tends to inactivate CaMKII. We found a novel protein that interacts with CaMKII at fly synapses called CASK that tends to inactivate CaMKII thereby disrupting the ability of CaMKII to undergo the molecular memory switch. These changes would be predicted to interfere with LTP-like events and learning and memory. Therefore in this proposal we wish to determine the direct role of CASK and CaMKII activity in synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory using flies. To achieve this we will make new fly CaMKII and CASK mutants and determine the effect of these together or alone on a range of synaptic events in parts of the fly brain that mediate learning and memory. Finally we will determine the role of CaMKII and CASK in the fly's learning and memory behaviour. This will provide important insight into how brains have evolved their huge capacity to acquire and store information.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>CaMKII is an abundant kinase in the brain, constituting 1-2% of its total protein and is the main protein in the hippocampal postsynaptic density. Once activated by increased Ca2+, CaMKII is able to cause a switch in its own activity (called T286 autophosphorylation), which allows it to have increased enzymatic activity independent of elevated Ca2+. This special ability of CaMKII has been called the 'molecular memory switch' and is required for LTP and learning. In addition CaMKII can mediate other changes that occur during synaptic plasticity and memory formation. These CaMKII mediated changes in synaptic plasticity are required for learning and memory in most animals including Drosophila. Recently we and others have shown that when Ca2+ is low (i.e. at quiescent synapses) CaMKII can regulate its own activity by a second mechanism (called T306 autophosphorylation) and this tends to inactivate CaMKII even if postsynaptic Ca2+ levels rise. We found a novel protein that interacts with CaMKII at fly synapses called CASK which is able to increase the ability of CaMKII to undergo T306 autophosphorylation and by doing so interferes with the ability of CaMKII to undergo T286 autophosphorylation, This interaction would be predicted to interfere with LTP-like events and learning. Therefore in this proposal we wish to determine the role of CASK and its regulation of CaMKII activity in synaptic plasticity underlying learning using the genetically and experimentally tractable Drosophila system. To achieve this we will make new fly CaMKII and CASK mutants and determine their effect together or alone on changes in synaptic Ca2+ signaling, synaptic growth and activity-dependent changes in T286 and T306 autophosphorylation. Whenever possible we will measure these changes in parts of the fly brain that mediate learning and using acute changes in electrical activity or learning stimuli. Finally we will determine the role of CaMKII and CASK in associative learning and memory.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>432782</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Exeter</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Harnessing CRISPR/Cas9 technology to develop new models of epigenetic changes underlying Alzheimer's disease</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D640389-F314-475E-935E-472A5B77B0B6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Generation of preliminary data for follow on funding</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>1.

This work-package will be led by Dr James Hodges (Bristol) and will investigate the consequence of altering ANK1 gene expression in Drosophila models. For this work-package we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 system to up-/down-regulate the gene, for instance targeted change in expression of human ANK1 transcript associated with Alzheimer's in the fly. We will test these novel Drosophila models of Alzheimer's for any disease relevant changes in viability, longevity, neurodegeneration (of the compound eye), locomotion, circadian rhythm, sleep (all measured using the Drosophila Activity Monitor system) and associative memory (adult olfactory-shock assay). Based on this powerful phenotypic analysis of ANK1 mis-expression in future we will determine the underlying mechanism of action of any given defect using molecular genetic and electrophysiological protocols the latter informed by Dr Jon Brown and colleague's electrophysiological characterisation of ANK1 in iPSCs (work-package 4). In future we aim to exploit the ease of genetic manipulation and short generation and senescence time of the fruitfly to determine the age dependent changes in AD pathology resulting from ANK1 mis-expression. We would also aim to investigate if the changes alone are sufficient to cause AD-like pathology or perhaps synergistic when combined with transgenic expression of human mutant tau or toxic Amyloid ?42 peptide. This work-package will ultimately allow us to determine the function of the ANK1 gene and will have established an in-vivo model that will allow us in future to perform forward genetic screens and medium to high throughput drug screen for novel targets and treatments for AD compatible with the NC3Rs which we can then validate in our mice models and human cohorts.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>1 month research Lab project by 3 undergraduate student from various countries</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8A0A3BA7-A111-4FFE-9230-3F05B89CA0C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Training young people in Drosophila research

The discovery of a key molecule that triggers the chemical processes in our brain linked to the formation of memories could help to improve our understanding of memory loss.
BBSRC-funded research, led by scientists at the University of Bristol, is helping to better understand the mechanisms that enable us to form memories by studying molecular changes that occur at synapses in regions of the brain dedicated to memory.
Our ability to learn and form memories is due to an increase in nerve to nerve, 'synaptic' communication called long term potentiation. This communication is initiated through a chemical process triggered by calcium entering brain cells and activating a key enzyme called 'Ca2+ responsive kinase' (CaMKII). Once CaMKII is activated by calcium it triggers a switch in its own activity, enabling it to remain active even after the calcium has gone. This special ability of CaMKII to maintain its own activity has been termed 'the molecular memory switch'.
But, until now, the question still remained as to what regulates this key chemical process that allows us to learn and form long-term memories. 
Researchers from the University's School of Physiology and Pharmacology, conducted experiments using the fruit fly (Drosophila) to analyse and identify the molecular mechanisms controlling this switch. Using advanced molecular genetic techniques that allowed them to temporarily inhibit the flies' memory, the team were able to identify a gene called CASK as the synaptic molecule regulating the switch. The findings were published in Frontiers in Neural Circuits.
Dr James Hodge, the study's lead author, said, &amp;quot;Fruit flies are remarkably compatible for this type of study as they are both highly genetically tractable and possess similar neuronal functions as humans&amp;quot;. 
Memory test
In experiments to test learning and memory ability, the team trained flies to recognise two odours, one associated with a mild shock, the other without a shock. They found that around 90% were able to learn to avoid the odour associated with a shock after just one cycle of training. 
The team also found that flies lacking the CASK and CaMKII genes showed disrupted memory formation. In repeat memory tests, flies lacking these key genes were shown to have no ability to remember at three hours (mid-term memory) and 24 hours (long-term memory), although their initial learning or short-term memory wasn't affected.
Finally, the team introduced a copy of the human CASK gene into the genome of a fly that completely lacked its own CASK gene and was, therefore, not usually able to remember. They showed that flies which had a copy of the human CASK gene expressed in the part of their brain dedicated to learning could remember like a normal wildtype fly. 
Dr Hodge said, &amp;quot;These findings not only pave the way for us to develop new therapies which reverse the effects of memory loss but also prove the compatibility of Drosophila to model these diseases in the lab and screen for new drugs to treat dementia and age-related memory decline. Furthermore, this work provides an important insight into how brains have evolved their huge capacity to acquire and store information.&amp;quot;

? We find flies like humans find it hard to remember when they get old, by 20 days a fly is aging and is only able to remember 50% as good as a young 2 day old fly. We wish to study this aging process in the lab.
? We wish to know if manipulation of certain learning genes and changes in diet can improve the memory of these aged flies and allow them to have the memory of young flies again.

Learning and memory can be assayed in larvae to study the effect of neurodevelopmental genes and in flies to measure the contribution of adult plasticity genes. Furthermore, the short lifespan of Drosophila facilitates the analysis of genes mediating age-related memory impairment. The availability of many inducible promoters that subdivide the Drosophila nervous system makes it possible to determine when and where a gene of interest is required for normal memory as well as relay of different aspects of the reinforcement signal. Studying memory in adult Drosophila allows for a detailed analysis of the behavior and circuitry involved and a measurement of long-term memory. The length of the adult stage accommodates longer-term genetic, behavioral, dietary and pharmacological manipulations of memory, in addition to determining the effect of aging and neurodegenerative disease on memory. Classical conditioning is induced by the simultaneous presentation of a neutral odor cue (conditioned stimulus, CS(+)) and a reinforcement stimulus, e.g., an electric shock or sucrose, (unconditioned stimulus, US), that become associated with one another by the animal. A second conditioned stimulus (CS(-)) is subsequently presented without the US. During the testing phase, Drosophila are simultaneously presented with CS+ and CS- odors. After the Drosophila are provided time to choose between the odors, the distribution of the animals is recorded. This procedure allows associative aversive or appetitive conditioning to be reliably measured without a bias introduced by the innate preference for either of the conditioned stimuli. Various control experiments are also performed to test whether all genotypes respond normally to odor and reinforcement alone.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8C557C1A-0FC0-4C03-A172-E80FACDD15DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>More researchers using Drosophila as NC3Rs compatible organism for neuroscience
