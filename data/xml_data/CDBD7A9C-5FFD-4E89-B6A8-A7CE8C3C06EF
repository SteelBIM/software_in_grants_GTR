MAKESPACES</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M017591/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The main aim of the Network is to develop a shared multi-disciplinary vision and research agenda for the the role of makespaces in re-distributed manufacturing. A makespace is a catch-all term for an open access community fabrication workshop. It encompasses Fab Labs, Hackerspaces, Makerspaces and other facilities that can broadly be described as spaces with a suite of fabrication tools and technologies openly accessible for use by a community. The cross-disciplinary network of academic, industrial and policy experts will establish the future place, purpose and philosophy of makespaces within re-distributed manufacturing and investigate key drivers in enabling sustainable re-distributed manufacturing at a grassroots level. Insights will be gained into the opportunities for decentralised manufacturing and product innovation in makespaces, the role of makespaces in local communities and to nearby manufacturing businesses, as part of digital networks and in national and global supply chains. This will initially involve hosting research workshops and public facing discussions with invited experts, conducting research in towns and cities in the UK to map the current and potential interplay between makespaces and manufacturing businesses, waste management companies, education centres, suppliers and retailers. Following this work a set of feasibility studies will be run in order to trial potential opportunities and understand barriers and challenges. These activities together will signpost the research needed to fully explore the role makespaces can play in the future in acting as vital constituent in a rich landscape of re-distributed manufacturing. The Network will publish these research challenges to the wider community.

The network will be co-ordinated by Sharon Baurley at the Royal College of Art, who brings extensive experience of working in academia and collaborative research with industry. The network includes a broad spectrum of academics with expertise in industrial design and manufacturing, materials, standards and regulation of emerging technologies, technology and innovation policy, geographies of innovation and technological change, geographies of creative practice, sustainability and environmental impact, urban policy and regeneration, cities and climate change, waste management systems, new economic and business models enabled by the digital economy, interactive cooperative systems, digital innovation and IT as a utility. The network will also include the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) as well as makespaces from across the UK, micro and SME manufacturing businesses, waste management and recycling companies, software developers, technologists and technology developers and GOs and NGOs with interests in craft, design, innovation and manufacturing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will contribute to the development of a shared multi-disciplinary vision and research agenda for the 'role of makespaces in re-distributed manufacturing'. This vision will be explored at four different levels: At the Makespace level we will identify a vision for the key technologies, people and skills, tools, materials, resources, cultures and methods that are needed in makespaces for them to support redistributed manufacturing and in order to move from linear economy practice to circular economy practice. Key beneficiaries here include citizens, the communities to which they belong, the individuals, groups and organisations involved in the creation and sustainability of makespaces, and the suppliers of technologies, tools, and materials that enable makespaces. 
At the Local level we will identify a vision for how makespaces can help their local area with respect to manufacturing and manufacturing business development, and to successfully respond to economic (business generation), social (employment, training, skills), environmental (local manufacturing, supply, waste management), and technological changes. Key beneficiaries will be local businesses, local government, community groups, and individuals exploiting the potential of makespaces. 
At the Digital level we will identify a vision for the requirements of a digital network, resources, and tools to network makespaces and others (manufacturers, retailers, suppliers, support networks, investors, educational institutions, research centres, material resources, waste management, communities) in relation to small scale manufacturing within an online community of business, social and marketplace networks. The beneficiaries here will be all stakeholders in makespaces (at both local and national level). The ability to connect makespaces with each other, with businesses, and with tools and technologies, to share resources, opportunities and experience is critical to success.
At the National level we will identify a vision for how government policies and support, national institutions and networks, EU directives, and regional and national businesses and supply chains, can support and enable the 'makespaces in re-distributed manufacturing' model. The successful integration of makespaces into the wider take-up of redistributed manufacturing and the associated industries and businesses will serve to benefit these bodies and organisations through new models for industries, businesses, economic and investment, and quality, regulation and legislation. 
We will contribute to the development of a cross-Network vision and research agenda. We will work with the other RDM networks to ensure integration of makespaces into the ways of working of national and multinational industries and service organisations, and in the definition of a research agenda that accelerates this integration. 
By its construction and nature the Network will be an inclusive and collaborative body driven by its membership's needs and aspirations. The overall activities, and those of the groups working at the four levels, depend both upon the inputs of members and their uptake of the outputs, be they the overall vision and practice of integrating makespaces into mainstream re-distributed manufacturing, or participating in the future research agenda the Network will produce. 
The executive group will lead on the impact activities, with specific investigators taking a lead on identifying the vision and research challenges that relate to their expertise. 
Members of the executive group all have track records of working in close collaboration with industry, organisations, policy makers/government, and in the preparation of exhibitions and public engagement material. The RSA will be our principal impact partner, having many conduits - dissemination, industry engagement, public engagement, policy - through which the Network will ensure impact, namely the Makerspace Network, The Great Recovery, City growth Commission.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>467177</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>MCQN Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Indie Manufacturing Study</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D34E4AC-A14C-4140-8200-54A0970CEB3A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>N/A</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The core partners are undertaking action research in partnership, including data collection, analysis and defining a new model of mid-scale manufacturing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We hosted the symposium which brought this collaboration together, and held the research call that this project was proposed too.

During the case study participants were encouraged to collaborate on a design problem and to work together to develop designs via reflection on physical prototypes. The aim was for participants to learn from each other, so that the vocational learners at MAKLab could develop conceptual and theoretical understanding of the design process, while the Open University design students could engage with the making process and the realities of production. 

The 14 participants were randomly allocated partners to form designer-maker pairs, and within their pairs they were tasked with designing a chair that can be economically manufactured and transported. 
This brief was composed with reference to the earlier study reported by Prats and Garner (2009). MAKLab identified CNC (computer numerical control) routers as an appropriately flexible technology, with scope for learners to develop useful skills and expertise. The other requirements were identified with the intention to constrain the design process, and to ensure the designers' material discovery was focussed on human needs and production realities (Morgan, 2012). It was anticipated that the resulting project would be a collaboration between designers and makers, with both developing skills and knowledge, as they worked together in a manner that mimicked a real-world scenario of distributed manufacturing.

8 pairs of maker -designer started this research exercise with 7 pairs completing it. Resulting in a dataset and research insights documented elsewhere.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Making Futures conference - Future Makespaces</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E87781B-E03D-4E0B-B0D5-7334F9D9BF70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following the process of double-blind peer review, the authors were been accepted to present at the conference.

In particular, he focuses on the design of systems that lower societal materials intensity, primarily by decoupling use and ownership - in other words, systems of shared use. Cameron has published a range of articles on the role of design in the promotion of the sharing economy and collaborative consumption. Framing Transition Design as a response to the imperatives for change: the need to develop societies that resource themselves in more sustainable and equitable ways. This event brought to bear this thinking and expertise on the subject of redistributed manufacturing and the roles of makespaces in enabling new forms of value creation and distribution, product design and new types of business models.

The structure of the event enabled rapid trust forming and the opportunity to discuss in depth and in detail with a peer group of international professionals. Following on from this event, a collaborative paper is in progress and a range of formal and informal interdisciplinary collaborations and research partnerships have started.

Workshop 2: Innovating Accreditation (Milton Keynes, 04/09/2015) was developed and delivered in collaboration by Mark Gaved, Iestyn Jowers and Simon Cross from the Open University in collaboration with Delphine Dallison and Mark Craig from MAKLab. 

Alternative accreditation could be a way forward for makespaces, but they need to work in partnership with industry either at national level (via job centre, SDS or other governmental bodies) or at local level (makespace identifies local industry training needs and works with them to tailor accredited training). This gathering of &amp;lt;20 experts in open making, distributed education and accreditation was impactful, triggering engagement with Open University's Open Educational Resources project team (ongoing discussions) following Workshop 2 (regarding Open Badges and other alternative modes of accreditation).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Final workshop RE:FORM</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD6CFCD2-AD99-4918-BDAB-E4E7C34E798B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of the final workshop was to report on RE:FORM activities to the network we had developed, and propose future directions to interested parties. Based on the lower than expected turn-out in Workshop 2, we decided to change the format, moving from a single all-day event to an early evening public dissemination event (open to all), to attract participants who would not be able to attend during working hours; and a second, invitation-only event to representatives from MAKLab's industry contacts where we would present our work and request feedback. 
A further third event was added: a debriefing and reflection session for the summer school makers and designers. A number of designers had indicated that they'd like to see MAKLab and meet their partnering makers, and we also felt this might be a good opportunity to describe the overall research aims of the project to summer school participants and invite their feedback, both reflecting on the summer school but also their consideration of the project and its outcomes as a whole. 
The event was successful, triggering further discussions with the scottish government about accrediting manufacturing experience in makespaces through apprenticeships.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RE:FORM website</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F5DAFF2-D49D-4BBC-A958-8A49601C5280</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A project website has been central to RE:FORM (http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/reform).

Our goal from the beginning has been to build something useful and useable for makerspaces, researchers, and anyone with a general curiosity. Along the way, we've gathered identifiable data on makerspaces' locations, space, tools and materials, membership and users, amenities and services, external relationships, legal structure and founders, as well as aspirations and challenges. There's also some anonymised data on makerspace turnover, income, expenditure and business rates. - See more at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/top-findings-open-dataset-uk-makerspaces#sthash.I4IISHSk.dpuf</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B15F2F7-20A4-4871-A396-34CF6DDC3D68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Makerspaces are a open access resource which has grown exponentially over the last decade, they are associated with some rather grand rhetoric around their role in civic and industrial life and there was a poor understanding of the types and range of facilities and aptitudes they possess. As this was the first large scale database with a clearly defined and rigorous method, pursued in an open manner, this dataset has had significant impact, enabling both researchers, policy makers and makerspaces themselves to understand more about the broader makerspace territory and the challenges and successes of a range of types of spaces. The associated user guide to the dataset provided easy access to headline findings and initial analysis through infographics and commentary, whereas the dataset github release has enabled other researchers to build upon and integrate this research into their work.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>NESTA Open dataset of UK Makerspaces</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nesta.org.uk/uk-makerspaces-data</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This dataset records the asynchronous communications of research study participants over a 12 week time period. 

A variety of methods were used to record all aspects of the case-study. The primary method was an online forum that participants were encouraged to use to communicate with each other and with the project team. Forums have limitations as methods of communication, being impersonal, asynchronous and text-based, but they also have significant strengths, because they can be accessed at any time and place, their asynchronous nature encourages more reflective and considerate dialogue, and a record of conversations is kept and can be revisited (Ellis, 2001). For the purposes of this research, forums were deemed appropriate to replicate real-world asynchronous communication that often takes place between distributed designers and makers. The record of conversations was also identified as an important benefit, because it resulted in a rich data source which could be used to analyse the participant's communications.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4DCC0C01-ED76-4E48-9784-B5E3D1D97258</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This dataset has enabled analysis of effective learning in distributed teams for redistributed manufacturing.
