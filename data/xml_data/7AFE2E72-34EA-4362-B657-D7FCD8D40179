Through participant observation and virtual archival research it explores UK Uncut?s peculiarly twenty-first century approach towards activism. Instead of being connected to each other through newspapers and national meetings, this nationwide movement is gathered under its website and facebook page. Instead of slogans and marches, UK Uncut put on playful street performances called ?actions?. Instead of offering a comprehensive political programme, they raise awareness of the impact of austerity policies by acting them out in microcosm. So the unemployment caused by public sector cuts on the day of the Chancellor?s third budget becomes a dole queue outside Whitehall, while the coalition government?s decision to block Legal Aid becomes a people?s road block in streets across the country.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study examines therefore, the ways in which their activism takes the form of certain creative theatrical engagements with ?the spectacle? (our social reality as constituted by the media), in order to convey their political message. More broadly, it situates the movement within its own cultural context: exploring how the movement?s vision of a moral society emerges from within a specifically British paradigm.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This study aims to understand contemporary forms of political sociability and active citizenship in Britain. Its potential wider impact is therefore profound, to the extent that it will provide politicians, policy-makers, other civil servants, think tanks, public intellectuals and commentators, and the general public, with new insights into both public opinion and more critically, into how the British people actually live their shared lives as citizens today. It is widely acknowledged that there is growing apathy and disaffection in Britain with traditional political parties, visible in the decline all established parties have seen both in passive membership and activist enthusiasm. The story of UK Uncut's comparative success, will help those listed above to comprehend what forces compel certain portions of the British public to mobilise themselves, what social institutions they hold sacred and will act to defend, as well as how they go about doing it. The reinvigoration of civil society is a universally desirable social turn across the whole political spectrum, and my research and analysis will uncover and illustrate the manifold ways in which this is already happening, enabling reflection and action from a whole range of actors.
 A second more direct group of beneficiaries are community or civil society organisations themselves. In the project title I am deliberately playing on the double-entendre of 'spectacular': meaning a form of activism which performs for the spectacle, but also one which is 'daring, thrilling'. UK Uncut's extensive use of Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Ustream, email and SMS messaging, takes advantage of the possibilities of digital technology in a way which has enhanced social reach and powerful effects. Civil society organisations, particularly small community-based groups which are not host to expensive public relations departments, would benefit in the same way from updating their cultures and practices to exploit digital technology more thoroughly. Such cybernetic communication tools, can help local or even regional communities to share resources, support, services and all other forms of community exchange, with more rapidity and ease.
 Both of these groups will be effectively reached through a variety of different means. For the first group, the most effective medium for communicating my research outputs will be through the established press. Articles, interviews and podcasts will all be exploited for their potential for wide societal extension. Public-speaking events such as UCL Lunchtime Lectures are also a quick and effective way of reaching a local London audience. However, it is important for me not to be too 'London-centric' in my public engagement. This study concerns events that are unfolding in the UK as a whole and it should be clearly manifest in my impact methodology. As a result, I will also commit to a two-week 'Impact tour' at various regional cities around the UK, to screen the documentary-film I aim to produce, about UK Uncut as a new kind of digitally-mediated civil society organisation. Finally, I will set-up a personal website with a variety of audio and visual files, as well as feedback forms and contact details, so that both groups are presented with a further resource on which to follow up their interest in the study.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>155554</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>I was asked by the curator of the material culture collection at UCL Anthropology to loan three artifacts from my fieldwork for display in the foyer.

This is usually accompanied by a specific 'crisis' (the loss of a job, some kind of physical or emotional trauma) which initiates a process of politicization.

I have also learned that Anonymous as a political movement does not exist before 2011, and as such is closely chronologically linked to the financial crisis of 2008 and the austerity response which followed it.

I have also discovered that film and visual media are key sites of inspiration and learning for people from the movement. The role of documentary films in particular being primary media for the acquisition of knowledge about the society, politics and the environment.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The essential discovery of this project, is that 'Anonymous' is not simply an 'anti-austerity' or even an 'anti-capitalist' movement, but one which has brought about profound symbolic transformations. This means that members engage with the symbolic mediums through which the public sphere is constituted (institutions, the mainstream media, the law, money, taxation etc) in very different ways from non-members. At present it is impossible to say what the long-term consequences of these symbolic shifts will be, but simply that anonymous is a contemporary case study of a profoundly changed relationship to citizenship in Britain, arising from marginalization.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A7594EDC-131F-4A2F-8128-4E7EBD9552F4</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F262F0AE-2956-4AE9-995B-50EAD993F945"><gtr:id>F262F0AE-2956-4AE9-995B-50EAD993F945</gtr:id><gtr:title>The negation of hierarchy and its consequences</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Anthropological Theory</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a5ad8d9bd2e9fd44e46da44a3ce74e01"><gtr:id>a5ad8d9bd2e9fd44e46da44a3ce74e01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peacock V</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1463-4996</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B08AE0E1-AE23-40BC-8453-153D958EB2D6"><gtr:id>B08AE0E1-AE23-40BC-8453-153D958EB2D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Jeffrey S Juris and Alexander Khasnabish (eds), Insurgent Encounters.
