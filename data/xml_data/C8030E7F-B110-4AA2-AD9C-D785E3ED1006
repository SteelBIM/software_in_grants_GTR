In 2009, the UK Border Agency announced moves to increase the private provision of dispersal accommodation for asylum seekers and to halt contracts with local authorities. Such a move effectively ends the provision of public housing to asylum seekers in a number of British cities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research represents the first endeavour to examine the impacts of this policy shift. The project aims to explore how four urban authorities are responding to these changes and how subsequent negotiations between urban authorities, the UK Border Agency, private accommodation providers and asylum support groups affect the lives of those seeking sanctuary. The multi-sited research is centred upon four cities with significant dispersal numbers; Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow and Sunderland. In each city a multi-method approach will involve:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>archival and media research&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>interviews with key figures in the refugee sector and local authorities&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a public forum for stories of asylum&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>focus groups with asylum seekers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>observation of asylum campaigns. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The research will be disseminated widely via a series of podcasts to communicate key findings to policy, media and third sector communities.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will benefit a wide-range of user groups, being of particular benefit to; 
1. The UK Border Agency who control UK asylum policy nationally and run nationwide dispersals. The potential for impact is significant here in terms of shaping future policy approaches to asylum dispersal, accommodation and welfare provision through highlighting experiences of dispersal in Britain today. 
2. The local authorities, councillors and MP's of the four case study cities, along with other dispersal zone urban authorities. These groups will benefit from a focus on their work to accommodate asylum groups and impact is envisioned in best practice cases being transferred between authorities. 
3. Regional Strategic Migration Partnerships in each study area will benefit from an examination of the experiences of asylum seekers within their region, together with an analysis of the power relations of different asylum organisations and authorities. Impact would be evidenced in offering evaluative data to support the work of migration partnerships in accommodating those seeking asylum. 
4. Asylum seekers in each of the four cities will benefit from the opportunity to discuss their experiences of dispersal. These narratives will be utilised to offer policy recommendations to local authorities and UKBA and as such may indirectly impact the lives of those seeking asylum both now and in the future. 
5. Asylum NGOs, service providers and third sector organisations will benefit from the heightened profile of their work in each city and through a greater understanding of the contexts and experiences of urban dispersal. Best practice cases of asylum provision and support will be transferred between cities and via dissemination documents and presentations so as to impact future approaches to asylum welfare. Here the researcher has existing links with British Red Cross as a starting point for networking. 
6. Social movements and campaigns on asylum such as No Borders, City of Sanctuary and Refugee Action will benefit from a focus on how they may influence the negotiations of urban authorities on asylum. Cases of good practice and creative ideas for advocacy will be compiled and disseminated through the researchers existing network of contacts with City of Sanctuary (see letter of support). 
7. The Asylum Seeker Support Teams of each urban authority will benefit from a comprehensive exploration of the context and experience of dispersal in their city, thus allowing insights into asylum seeker's use of services and support to be communicated. 
8. The wider public of each city may benefit from an in-depth focus upon the history of their city relative to asylum, from the opening of debate over asylum issues within their city and from opportunities to engage with asylum groups in discussion forums. Impact here may be long term and incremental in terms of a shifting orientation to asylum issues in the future. 
9. Urban housing authorities will benefit from the study of dispersal accommodation and the ways in which different cities negotiate contracts with UKBA and private housing contractors. This will impact future decision-making and policy transfer between cities. 
10. Nationwide think-tanks and public policy groups such as IPPR, ICAR and the Institute of Race Relations will benefit from research which intersects with their key agendas. The research will help to shape the approaches to asylum these groups take in their lobbying activities. 
11. European policymakers, practitioners and organisations with a focus on forced migration, such as the European Council on Refugees and Exiles, will benefit through a focus on the practice of dispersal in the UK context as a means to draw comparisons to other European dispersal schemes. Examples of good practice, the privatisation of asylum accommodation and the impact of welfare restrictions on asylum experience will all be used to promote policy transfer and the impact of the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>160576</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lianhe Zaobao media commentary</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C8FA356A-4AD1-4A26-AC8D-BA551AEB6D2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Media commentary on refugee resettlement and accommodation in Europe for the Singapore-based Chinese language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>IMISCOE Conference, Geneva</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D7642F8-28F5-4ACF-A263-7C46A71C73AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I presented findings from my urban asylum research at the International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion network (IMISCOE) annual international conference in Geneva.

First, at a governmental level, the initial findings have been cited in parliamentary debates in the House of Commons and cited in a Home Affairs Committee investigation into asylum accommodation in the UK. In both instances, research findings were used by MPs as a means to question current policy, to challenge the evidence of housing providers contracted to offer asylum accommodation on behalf of the government, and to propose alternative means of communication between the Home Office and local authorities in terms of asylum housing policy and support mechanisms. It is expected that this impact will continue as the Home Affairs Committee reports on its findings in 2017 as written evidence has been submitted to this Committee from the research. In these instances, the research has shaped MPs understanding of this policy field and influenced their thinking on how to change policy into the future. A further example of this, following from the Home Affairs evidence, is that I have been approached by two English MPs to advise them on asylum policy and housing in advance of meetings with the Home Secretary to discuss these issues. This shows a direct ability to influence MPs thinking and to promote policy change. 

Second, in the third sector the research findings have been used by two prominent asylum and refugee support organisations. In Scotland, the Scottish Refugee Council have taken forward some of the research findings and included these in recent reports on asylum accommodation in Scotland, together with informing their policy recommendations for the Scottish Government. And in Northern Ireland, my research findings have been influential in shaping a report from the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers (NICRAS) on asylum accommodation in Northern Ireland. My findings informed the recommendations of this report and have shaped the thinking of NICRAS in terms of policy implementation. This report is currently under consideration by the Northern Irish Executive and I am working with NICRAS at present to develop a comprehensive policy briefing for Northern Irish politicians. This displays a clear influence for my findings in shaping third sector policy and informing approaches to policy from third sector groups. 

Finally, my findings have been used extensively by the media in discussing asylum accommodation and support issues in the UK. I have made a wide range of media appearances to discuss these issues, my work has featured in The Independent and Society Now in the UK, in the Swedish and Belgian press, and formed the basis of a BBC Radio 4 documentary and a forthcoming BBC Newsnight documentary. These media engagements demonstrate that my findings are being used to inform public debates and perceptions on asylum support and policy, and that these are shaping views on these issues. I have sought to enhance this public engagement with my findings through a concern with shaping educational approaches to migration and refugee rights, through presentations to secondary school audiences, long-standing work with the Princes Teaching Institute to inform teachers on migration issues, and invitations to give public lectures for both the Royal Geographical Society and the Geographical Association. Each of these uses my findings to influence how young people understand refugee issues.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>84C26D2F-E3BF-447D-B13F-370EAF11000C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research produced 106 interviews with people across four cities (Birmingham, Cardiff, Glasgow, and Sunderland), including asylum seekers, local authority representatives, asylum support groups and networks, journalists, policy-makers and service providers, along with interviews with national policymakers and stakeholders. 

The main findings of the research demonstrate that the asylum dispersal system in the UK is fragmented and uneven. Experiences of dispersal among local authorities, support services, and asylum seekers vary considerably by location, and have become increasingly uneven and unstable following the privatisation of accommodation in 2012. The dispersal of asylum seekers has always been driven by the housing-market, with asylum seekers often located in areas of existing social deprivation. However, since 2012 this trend has accelerated as private providers are procuring property in the lowest-cost markets, and seeking to extend dispersal into new areas that often lack support services and prior experience of working with asylum seekers. 

The research found that lessons from earlier phases of dispersal have not been sufficiently acted upon. In particular, greater community preparation and communication is required for all dispersal areas, and funding for services should allow the needs of asylum seekers and wider communities to be recognised and addressed together. In all of the cities studied, the ability to provide support services for asylum seekers had been diminished through a combination of privatisation and the national and local effects of austerity. This meant local authorities and third sector groups were increasingly unable to maintain support and advocacy services. The provision of support from private contractors was uneven and often lacked adequate coordination with statutory services. 

Dispersed asylum seekers highlighted three key barriers to feeling secure within their dispersal city. Firstly, the 'no-choice' nature of dispersal was reported as restricting individual's ability to maintain social networks and community links. Secondly, a lack of coordinated support and advice services in all four cities was argued to leave individuals feeling isolated and insecure. Even where third sector organisations and charities were in operation and well used, asylum seekers reported uncertainty over where to seek advice, the strained nature of provision, and a discomfort at relying on charitable provision. Thirdly, privatisation was felt to have increased the distance between asylum seekers and accommodation providers, allowing for the deferral of responsibility. Asylum seekers and their advocates felt that they were passed between contractors when addressing issues with accommodation, leading to the slow resolution of issues and a sense of powerlessness among asylum seekers.
 
Moving forward, the research found that local authorities across the UK feel increasingly marginalised within asylum policy. Successful dispersal requires clear and effective communication between local authorities, the Home Office and support organisations. Privatisation has shifted the balance of power between these groups and in some areas there was a marked breakdown in communication between organisations. In many areas, Strategic Migration Partnerships have played a key role in communication between stakeholders, but these are over-stretched and need further support. The significance of these tensions, is that local authorities are increasingly withdrawing support for dispersal, meaning a reduction in possible locations and a narrowing of the geography of dispersal across the UK. The research has thus pointed to critical questions for future work around the ongoing negotiations of asylum accommodation by the Home Office, and the role of local authorities in refugee resettlement through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme announced in 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Initial findings have already been presented to a number of policy audiences through Strategic Migration Partnerships, and policy feedback and discussion events. An initial findings document has been circulated to stakeholders and policy audiences nationally. 

Academically, the findings may be taken forward by researchers in social policy, asylum politics, and geography. The opening to critical scrutiny of discussions over how asylum dispersal policy is negotiated will be of significance for studies of social policy, and links to current refugee resettlement schemes in the UK may be taken forward by scholars in refugee studies. Ongoing conference and seminar presentations to academic audiences, together with a forthcoming research monograph, will ensure continued academic impact as the findings develop through further analysis. 

Beyond academia, audiences for the findings include those involved in public policy around asylum (the Home Office, local authorities, and service providers), third sector organisations and charities in the refugee sector, and members of the public. Findings may be taken forward by third sector organisations such as the Scottish Refugee Council, in advocating for an independent review of asylum housing and dispersal policy. Discussions over this use of the findings is ongoing following the citation of the findings in Hansard in a debate over asylum support services. Findings may also be taken forward by local authorities in shaping future discussions over refugee resettlement and dispersal policy, these audiences will be targeted through publications in policy-orientated outlets, and through a podcast aimed at local authorities. The Home Office may take forward the findings in negotiating the future of asylum dispersal contracts with private providers and with local authorities, and in establishing standards for support services in dispersal areas. This audience will be further targeted through a briefing report with policy recommendations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>54676864-6F0E-4DC3-9538-DC99A6A149CB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in oral evidence given to Home Affairs Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E531E141-ACDC-47C5-82C2-7D2D106DD583</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/home-affairs-committee/asylum-accommodation/oral/38046.html</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Hansard</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5105D998-A64B-41AC-AF57-2684AE904A2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My research findings document was cited and discussion in the House of Commons as part of a debate on the structure of asylum accommodation and support in the UK.
