It seeks to expand and add value to the growing research on the topic of rebound effects, including in particular the research that currently being conducted by the Centre on Innovation and Energy Demand (CIED). 

Rebound effects occur where the potential energy savings from efficiency-enhancing innovations are partially (or wholly) offset by a variety of economic responses to cheaper energy services. For example, if a household installs a condensing boiler that uses less gas to produce a given amount of hot water, this may encourage them to heat their homes for longer and/or to a higher temperature, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. This is termed a direct rebound effect. In addition, any money saved on gas bills will be spent on other goods and services, such as buying a new TV. This changed and additional consumption may involve direct energy use by the household, but also indirect use of the energy that is 'embedded' in all goods and services from different stages of their supply chain, both in the UK and abroad. These are termed indirect rebound effects. Moreover, shifts in consumption patterns may also change the demand for locally produced and imported goods relative to exports, thereby impacting on economic activity, prices, incomes, energy consumption and carbon emissions in a range of markets and regions. These are termed economy wide rebound effects. 

Similar mechanisms apply to cost-effective energy efficiency improvements by producers, such as steel manufacturers. Energy efficiency improvements lower the marginal cost of energy services, thus encouraging increased use of those services by the producer. Lower input costs permit reductions in output prices, which will in turn increase output, boost productivity and improve competiveness both in the sector where efficiency improves and down-stream (e.g. in white goods manufacture). This will encourage increased activity and energy use throughout the economy. Again, a variety of indirect and economy-wide rebound effects will come into play as prices and incomes adjust and as production and consumption decisions change. The net effect of these various mechanisms may be very significant and could potentially undermine achievement of the objectives of UK energy efficiency policies.

However, while the existence of such effects is well established, the evidence on the size of these effects remains limited, contradictory and controversial. The lessons learned have also proved to difficult to communicate to policy and stakeholder audiences, with the result that rebound effects continue to be widely ignored and/or misunderstood.

The current CIED research applies a range of techniques to estimate the direct rebound effects for individual energy services. However, this is only a part of the story - and potentially just a small part. The proposed project will add value to this activity by: first, extending the focus from individual sectors and services to the whole UK economy; second, by including the impacts on energy use and emissions along international supply chains; and third, incorporating a much wider range of economic mechanisms. It will investigate the impacts of improved efficiency in both industrial and household energy use, focusing in particular on the role of investment and energy supply decisions in determining different elements of rebound. The central aim is to clarify and advance the knowledge and evidence base regarding the source, nature, determinants and magnitude of direct, indirect and economy-wide rebound effects from different types of energy-saving innovations in different sectors. Moreover, the project aims effectively to communicate the implications of the results to various audiences.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Improved energy efficiency is of critical importance to regional, national and international attempts to address climate change. It is therefore essential that energy efficiency policies deliver substantial energy and emission savings. This is not always been the case in the past, owing in part to problems with the design and implementation of those policies, and in part to a variety of unintended consequences that generally go under the heading of rebound effects. If future policies are to be effective, it is essential that those rebound effects are better understood, allowed for and addressed.
To date, rebound effects have been largely ignored by policymakers and other stakeholders, with the result that the energy and emission savings from different policy options have frequently been overestimated. This results in part from the limited evidence base that is available and the corresponding uncertainty over the magnitude of rebound effects in different sectors. During our previous programme of research on this topic (e.g. Turner's ESRC First Grant) we achieved substantial impact with key stakeholders (e.g. Scottish Government, DEFRA, DECC) in terms of improved understanding of rebound mechanisms and their related implications for economic development. We intend to build upon this impact within the present proposal. 
We have identified two streams of potential impact and have proposed a comprehensive programme of stakeholder engagement, embedded within the research process, to help realise this: 
First, we aim to significantly raise awareness and improve understanding of rebound effects within different stakeholder groups. For many stakeholders, awareness of rebound effects is currently confined to direct rebound effects for specific household energy services - notably 'comfort taking' following household insulation improvements. Attention also tends to be focused upon short-term impacts within the UK's borders. Our work and engagement activities will: highlight the broader, indirect and economy wide, rebound effects following such improvements; extend the focus to the global level and over the longer term; and highlight the potential trade-offs and implications for UK climate policy and (sustainable) economic growth. 
Second, we aim to facilitate knowledge exchange on applied multi-sector economy-wide modelling. The application of these techniques is essential if rebound effects are to be more fully understood and some progress is now being made. For example, both DECC and the Scottish Government are in the process of developing capacity in CGE modelling for energy and climate policy analysis. We are also collaborating with colleagues in the Energy Efficiency Deployment Office at DECC on the development of CGE models for analysing household energy efficiency policy, together with colleagues in the Scottish Government who have adopted our CGE framework for economic modelling. The proposed project would greatly enhance the impact generated within these collaborations, both through model development and specification as well as through research results.
Impact will therefore build upon our existing links with key stakeholders such as DECC, DEFRA, the Scottish Government, the IEA Energy Efficiency and Environment Division, the EC Joint Research Centre Institute for Energy and Transport and other stakeholders. Additional stakeholders will be identified through a mapping exercise and engagement and impact strategy for those stakeholders will be developed. This is outlined further in the Pathways to Impact and includes: the formation of a small project Advisory Group; the organisation of three stakeholder workshops (in London and Glasgow); the publication of three policy briefs; wide-ranging media coverage of project results; blog posts; social media activities; extensive participation in workshops and seminars; and other knowledge exchange activities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>302477</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fiona Riddoch presentation at afternoon session of CEP EPSRC end-of-project event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3137CF53-F404-41E2-B138-F4B37B83E3CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fiona Riddoch gave a presentation at the afternoon session of the EPSRC end-of-project event organised by CEP at Church House, Westminster, London on the 2nd February 2017.

The material presented was an early draft of a policy briefing that draw results from a Working Package 2 academic paper. The main goal was to present the key results and get feedback on both the appeal that these results would have to an audience of policy makers as well as the presentation of those results. 
The presentation fueled a really useful discussion with the attendees. Due to their experience in engaging with policy makers, the feedback we received was rather helpful in tailoring what was an early draft of the policy brief so that is more suitable for the audience that the policy brief is targeting. As a result of the comments we received, a number of changes were made both to the content and the presentation style of our policy brief.

Following the presentation a member of Zero Waste Scotland saw potential in the approach followed in the paper from which the policy brief derived. As a result there has been suggested a potential collaboration between CEP and Zero Waste Scotland that is now the subject of an intended application to the University of Strathclyde EPSRC Impact and Innovation Fund .</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Karen Turner presentation at UCD workshop on &quot;Consumers, Economics and Energy Systems&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>574D1311-F251-45EF-AD2D-E0C50555C988</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation was given at a workshop organised by the University College Dublin on &amp;quot;Consumers, Economics and Energy Systems&amp;quot;.

We have completed initial dissemination of findings with Scottish and UK policy communities via a range of policy briefing outputs and stakeholder events (most recently our final event held in Westminster on 2 February 2017). 

However, a solid opportunity for genuine impact at Scottish level arose in September 2016 when the First Minister announced an economic stimulus package including &amp;pound;20million for energy efficiency improvements. This provided an opportunity to develop non-technical outputs from the EPSRC work, beginning with an invitation by the Existing Homes Alliance to comment on a press release, an article in the Glasgow Herald, and an International Public Policy Institute Policy Brief and blog published in September/October 2017. These outputs all make arguments about the wider and sustained expansionary opportunities beyond those offered by the initial stimulus investment. Their preparation was triggered largely by approaches from WWF who are active through the Existing Homes Alliance on energy efficiency topics. We are currently undertaking an EPSRC Impact Accelerator Project in partnership with WWF and the Energy and Climate Division of Scottish Government exploring the economy-wide impacts of the &amp;pound;20million investment already announced.

Positive feedback from Scottish Government staff at the Energy and Climate Division to blog, brief and popular/industry press articles (and an invitation for the PI Turner to address the Scottish Parliament Cross Party Group on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency) has encouraged us to develop our work in this area looking specifically at Scotland with the aim of impacting on the current development of the Scottish Energy Efficiency Plan (SEEP). The argument of Scottish Government staff is that politicians are often reluctant to promote policies such as energy efficiency that may be seen as 'interfering' with the lives and domestic decisions of individual people/families. However, Scottish Government colleagues consider that, if a case for wider economic returns can be made, this may provide a counter argument to their concerns and a motivation for considering energy efficiency as a national infrastructure priority. Depending on both budgetary positions and political responses (were support of 'better off' households in improving energy efficiency may be problematic). That we have Scottish Government colleagues and other stakeholders already keen to listen to, and work with us on developing our work to have impact on the SEEP, and wider Scottish Energy Strategy consultation and policy development process, is already an early stage impact from our work. As noted above, we have used this as the basis to secure a small EPSRC Impact Accelerator project for March 17. As well as exploring the impacts of energy efficiency investment, there is interest from Scottish Government in terms of learning about the modelling approach used, as they have access to an economy-wide model that could incorporate the developments we have made to explore energy efficiency issues. 

We have also laid foundations to develop impact at the UK level. Following consultation with colleagues at BEIS, Ofgem and HM Treasury regarding the value of economy-wide modelling of wider benefits of increased energy efficiency in different household income groups, we arranged the aforementioned 'end of project' event in Westminster in February 2017. In particular, a relatively large contingent of representatives from the new department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), which has assumed the former DECC's responsibility for energy efficiency policy at UK level attended and we have since arranged two follow-up meetings with BEIS to discuss our modelling work and research findings and explore possibilities for follow-up activity (possibly involving a second EPSRC Impact Accelerator application). The main interests of BEIS cross over between developing understanding of the IEA 'Multiple Benefits' of energy efficiency framework (which we are able to model) and understanding how the type of economic modelling we use - also applied by HM Treasury - may help develop understanding of the wider economic impacts of energy efficiency policy actions.

There is a second area of impact in terms of modelling for policy analysis. Through our work considering the treatment of energy supply we have begun to look at potential interaction between the economic system CGE model used in this project and energy systems TIMES models, where the latter are also employed by UK and Scottish Governments. As part of the project, and linking to two Scottish Government ClimateXChange Fellowships we have won (with engineering colleagues at Strathclyde) the project organised a workshop on potential linkages between CGE and TIMES models in November 2016 (see under Engagement activity for presentations). The Scottish Government have written a letter stating that &amp;quot;The workshop was very useful in terms of moving our thinking forward as it explored in a balanced way the opportunities from linking TIMES and macroeconomic models, such as CGE, and also some of the challenges which would need to be overcome&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3B4F9183-B652-470D-9577-CD338C2A3F41</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research funded on this grant has focussed on identifying positive ways of communicating the wider impacts of increased energy efficiency. This is crucially important in a policy environment where energy efficiency is widely recognised as the most cost effective means of reducing energy use, but where energy efficiency initiatives must compete for resources with a range of policy priorities. 
One important development has been the proposal of a Carbon Saving Multiplier (CSM) as a useful analytical tool derived in a format familiar to many policy audiences. It focuses on how much carbon is saved throughout what are often highly carbon-intensive energy supply chains in addition to direct savings by more energy efficient actors, but brings in consideration of rebound effects through measurement of how the CSM is eroded depending on how financial savings are reallocated. Our aim is that over time the CSM will become a core indicator used in evaluating energy efficient action, focussing as it does on providing a more positive and transparent approach of identifying the energy and carbon savings achieved by energy efficiency improvement measures.
The research has also led to the important discovery that the 'Multiple Benefits of Energy Efficiency' proposed by the International Energy Agency in 2014 are likely to be realised through improving the efficiency with which UK households use energy in heating and lighting their homes. In this respect, our findings indicate that energy efficiency should be seen as a potential driver of economic expansion and development rather than solely as an option to achieve energy reduction and related climate change goals. In the last few months both the Scottish Government (through the Scottish Energy Efficiency Programme published in January 2017) and the UK Government (as reflected in the Green Paper published by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, also published in January 2017) recognise the need to improve industrial and/or residential energy efficiency and for this to play a role in delivering 'clean growth'. The findings of our research - communicated through a series of (written and verbal) policy briefings - has served to reinforce and support this view, and provides an important evidence regarding the societal returns (via sustained economic growth) to public support for energy efficiency programmes. 
The work has involved developing the type of multiple sector economy-wide input-output and 'CGE' modelling frameworks already used for policy analysis by government bodies such as HM Treasury and Scottish Government, but through this project introducing a focus on energy policy analysis. The methodological developments themselves have already had impact through our submission of evidence to a UK Parliament Environmental Audit Committee Inquiry on 'HM Treasury and Sustainability' in terms of helping a wider policy audience to understand the value of economy-wide modelling in considering energy policy issues. 
It has also led to continued collaboration with members of the IEA Multiple Benefits project team and international network, with further activity already being planned with focus beyond the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In our Pathways to Impact statement we identified two streams of potential policy impact:
(1) Raising awareness and improving understanding of rebound effects within different stakeholder groups.
(2) Facilitating knowledge exchange on applied multi-sector economy-wide modelling.
In terms of (1), communication of our research findings has focussed on explaining the much discussed and debated (in both academic and popular press) phenomenon of 'rebound' effects in energy use associated with energy efficiency initiatives in the context of the multiple economic benefits delivered by related expansionary processes in the wider economy. Through our academic publications, we envisage that the economic modelling community will continue to learn from and cite our work in developing understanding of energy efficiency, rebound and economic impacts in the context of a wide range of countries and energy efficiency initiatives. Through our non-academic (written and verbal) policy briefings, we anticipate that government bodies such as the Scottish Government and new UK BEIS, and NGOs such as the IEA will learn valuable lessons in designing policy actions to realise the multiple benefits of energy efficiency actions.
In terms of (2), we have already begun engaging with colleagues at HM Treasury, who conduct economy-wide modelling for the UK, regarding use of our modelling approaches for energy policy more generally, and with colleagues at BEIS regarding their use for energy efficiency impact analysis.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E22C1D39-4EED-4E38-87C7-CF18994FAC4C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Energy,Government, Democracy and
