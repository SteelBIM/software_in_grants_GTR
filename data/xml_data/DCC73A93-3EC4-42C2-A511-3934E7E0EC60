Growth</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/N013344/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>According to Stiglitz (2006), the financial system acts as the 'brain' of an economy. Financial institutions and markets promote the dissemination and co-ordination of information about resource availability at every level throughout the economy, and so they enable an efficient allocation of these resources for supporting economic growth. However, it is not altogether clear how finance can deliver inclusive financial development and growth. Recent empirical research shows that in LICs there are financial development gaps as well as financial inclusion gaps (Allen et al., 2014). In addition, the links between the financial system and economic development have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years, especially following the 2007-09 global financial crisis (Caballero, 2015). The current consensus is that there is urgent need for research on the role of the finance in fostering inclusive financial development and sustainable economic growth.

Led by the University of Birmingham, a consortium of UK and international partners will collaborate on this four-year programme of research. Partner institutions include the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex, Loughborough University, the Overseas Development Institute, SOAS at the University of London, and the University of Nottingham in the UK, and the Universities of Groningen in the Netherlands, Laval in Canada, and Columbia in the US. Crucially, the project consortium also includes researchers from institutions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), namely the University of Ghana-Legon and the African Economic Research Consortium (AERC) in Kenya, who stand to benefit from the organisational and institutional capacity-building opportunities which underpin the research programme.

The aim of this research is to identify workable policies to help make the financial sector an effective instrument in promoting financial inclusion and sustained growth in LICs, and consequently create an enabling environment for transitioning these countries to middle income status. We will provide a set of answers to ALL THREE critical questions posed in the Call for Proposals concerning i) the role of international capital flows in growth and development, ii) the design and provision of institutional frameworks to support financial development, and iii) the ways in which financial systems can help generate and transmit technical change in the economy as a whole.

To achieve this ambitious goal, the project will be structured into four clusters on 1) institutional framework for inclusive growth, 2) capital flows, 3) technological diffusion, and 4) a cluster which will run in parallel to the other three to synthesise findings in order to derive meaningful policy recommendations and drive tangible global impact. Component II of the programme is planned to focus on additional policy-oriented issues, and will be developed in tangent with DFID policymakers, the ESRC and other national and international academics and end-user stakeholders, and will be run in partnership with the Africa Growth Initiative at the Brookings Institute, US.

The research will cover a wide range of topics within the overall remit of financial sector development, so multiple innovative research methodologies will be employed across eight integrated work-streams. Methods include institutional analysis, i.e. the assessment of how institutional features of financial systems contribute to, or impede, financial sector objectives; field experiments; comparative analysis of the experience of countries with different policies and institutions; rapid appraisal and participatory appraisal methods; quantitative analysis of company and bank balance sheets, and quantitative and qualitative analysis of survey data. The major part of the research programme will entail empirical research based on fieldwork in selected LICs in SSA (Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia), with wider application to other LICs globally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The direct beneficiaries of this research will be individuals and companies in low income countries (LICs) whose wellbeing will be improved by both enhanced access to financial services (inclusion) and improved financing of development projects (effectiveness). There are three principal groups of beneficiaries:

1) Users of finance in low-income countries (LICs)

The research has been designed to maximise opportunities to engage with individuals in LICs through, for example, interviews, focus groups and surveys, seminars and research findings dissemination workshops. Outputs, influenced by their input to the project, will be geared towards influencing policy decisions which can maximise access to finance for those living in LICs in sub-Saharan Africa.

2) Organisations involved in financial development

The research will engage with organisations such as finance NGOs, banks and financial services organisations, and government departments by contributing to knowledge on financial inclusion, financial development, and on the types of policies most appropriate to the needs of financially excluded people. Furthermore, there will be scope for engagement with associations of entrepreneurs, e.g. micro, small and medium companies, to better understand their needs and major obstacles they face in accessing finance, to collect primary data at their level and to gain insight into their perceived view of proposed new financial innovations.

3) The broader policy community

The final group of beneficiaries is the broader community concerned with financial development and financing for development, including international organisations (e.g. the World Bank, African Development Bank), NGOs and donors such as DfID. The research will ensure that these institutions' actions can be better informed by contributions to knowledge on how to enhance the wellbeing of individuals through inclusive access to finance. 

The research will result in short, medium and long-term outputs for these groups:

Short-term benefits: During research delivery, key end-users will be engaged as project stakeholders to steer the project. This will ensure that impact is meaningful, and is influenced directly by their needs in order to respond to challenges which they face. Stakeholders will include those in senior positions of large organisations such as the African Development Bank, IMF and Higher Education Institutions in the research regions (through mechanisms such as the Advisory Board), through to users of finance in sub-Saharan Africa who will be invited to participate in workshops and focus groups to be delivered throughout the fieldwork phase of the project.

Medium-term: Upon wider dissemination of findings, it is anticipated that a set of key policy recommendations will be produced which will steer government officials, policy/decision makers, civil actors, donor groups, NGOs, and central banks in LICs in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The policies implemented as a result of these findings should seek to enable greater access to finance for those in SSA LICs, as well as greater integration of financial products and new technologies in financial organisations in these regions.

Long-term: In the long-term, it is hoped that the findings and outputs from this research, and associated policy changes in LICs, will be influential in the ongoing efforts to relieve poverty in LICs and offer substantiated evidence upon which to base strategies for the transitioning of counties in SSA from low- to middle-income status. Furthermore, it is hoped that, analyses of 'what works' in these regions will engender future research in other LICs globally.

A week-long Initial Stakeholder Workshop will be held in Ghana in the first year of the project for representatives from key research regions in SSA. It will include talks from notable guest speakers, knowledge exchange events, and interactive end-user seminars (full details are in the Pathways to Impact).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1726450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media and Publicity for Project</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>22D4E4B6-7025-41A7-BEE3-16FE3E4C9EA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The media and publicity for the project involved all the researchers, partner universities, and DEGRP.

There were three main presentations:
(1) Research paper and project presentations to Research Department, African Development Bank, in Abidjan in August 2016. About 45 researchers and practitioners from the African Development Bank attended and sparked interesting discussion on inclusive finance and inclusive growth in Africa, especially the lack of huge datasets to aid policy work. 
(2) Research seminar at the BCEAO (the Central Bank of 8 West African States, Dakar, Senegal) in August 2016. The seminar was attended by about 40 researchers and policy makers at the central bank; they expressed great interest in the research project, especially in issues relating to Basel III and the interbank market. 
(3) Research seminar at the Universit&amp;eacute; Nationale Felix Houphouet Boigny of Ivory Coast, in August 2016, was attended by about 60 researchers, staff and postgraduate students.

SESSION III: Panel Discussion - Inclusive Financial Development &amp;amp; Growth - Insights from policy and practice (Chair: Lemma W. Senbet, African
Economic Research Consortium)
In this panel discussion, policy makers were able to share with researchers some of the priority policy issues for their countries today (e.g. for central banks in Africa) or the
policy priorities of donor organisations (e.g. DFID Policy Unit). Panellists from the private sector may also speak about some issues faced by private sector practitioners
or their experiences in trying to access finance for small businesses. Policy and practitioner issues may be related to financial inclusion (e.g. access and affordability
of finance by households and businesses), overall financial development, the behaviour of banks (e.g. risk-taking), the behaviour of non-banks (e.g. insurance
companies, etc..), the role of the capital market in facilitating capital flows for financing governments as well as private sector companies, or other contemporary or
futuristic issues.

The main topic was: &amp;quot;Inclusive finance: Is this an illusion?&amp;quot; This was a two-day event on 7-8 November 2016 at the Birmingham Business School, University of Birmingham. The event featured six poster sessions, a public debate on 'financial inclusion' and a social media frenzy on 'inclusive finance'. Over the 2 days, more than 60 people attended physically and virtually through social media. 
The main activities comprised:
(1) A poster presentation session with supporting background video clips discussing key findings and implications of respective research posters.
(2) A Davos-style debate that will involve animated discussion on: &amp;quot;My brain has confessed that 'financial inclusion' is an illusion. You: What do you think?&amp;quot;
(3) On the second day, each poster presenter will run an open social media session on all aspects covered in their poster session and debate, including other research in the Department of Finance.

An example here is the active participation of the International Advisory Group made up of 13 distinguished persons from: (1) policy makers in the financial sector (central bank governors); (2) private sector practitioner in the financial sector; (3) civil society (at the rule-making global level); and (4) leading academics at the forefront of econometric methods and finance models.

The key finding relates to how foreign direct investment (FDI) in the banking sector affects the behaviour of the domestic financial sector in Africa (Work-stream 2.4 in the research project). 

For the last two decades, the spotlight has been on FDI in banks in Anglophone Africa. But, banks in Francophone West Africa are not only going cross-border, they are also leaving the cross-roads, where they had sojourned since 2008, in terms of bank regulation. The banks are taking the visible fork in the road, leading to high capital buffers. The beacon is the new regulatory tool, Basel III, with its new rules for global finance.
 
Using hand-collected bank level data from all West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) countries for 2000-2014, we (research team of Victor Murinde, Issouf Soumare and Desire Kanga ) investigate how high capital requirements affect the behaviour of domestic banks, taking into account bank ownership and cross-border banking. We establish that FDI in the banking sector of WAEMU countries, who have a regional central bank (BCEAO or Banque Centrale des &amp;Eacute;tats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest), is mainly through foreign bank ownership and cross-border banking. We find that banks' capital positions tend to be counter-cyclical in LICs, mimicking an important key element of Basle III, overall reducing credit risk in the banking sector. The overall policy implication of this finding is that, through foreign ownership and cross-border banking, FDI has the potential to stabilize the banking sector of WAEMU countries and hence to support the regulatory role of the regional central bank (the BCEAO).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are already working with with the Banque Centrale des &amp;Eacute;tats de l'Afrique de l'Ouest (BCEAO) to take these findings forward, undertake further relevant studies and enhance policy dialogue on the regulatory implications of these findings, especially to address the some reservations associated with FDI and cross-border banking in the region.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5E744796-680A-4067-9956-E0679D0FD744</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>We will conduct randomized controlled trials (RCT) to test the relevance of new financial products. We will use a mixture of quantitatative and qualitative research methodologies.More specifically, per intervention we will conduct 2 surveys (a baseline survey and an endline survey) and analyse the data using quantitative techniques. In addition, we will organize focus group discussions and in depth stakeholder interviews to complement and better understand the quantitative results.

The dataset includes all types of private capital flows: International - FDI, portfolio (bonds and equity) and bank lending; Domestic - bank lending, bond and equity
Capital markets primary issuances. The data are collected from multiple sources, namely central banks, national statistics, national investment authorities, stock exchanges, etc.., are reconciled to the World Bank Development Database. The sample period covers 10 years from 2006 to 2015 (unbalanced). Excludes self-funded investments &amp;amp; short term government lending (e.g. Treasury bills). So far, 16 sample countries in Africa are covered. 

A unique feature of the dataset is that it has 4 levels: (1) Country level; (2) Field for source i.e. FDI, bank lending, portfolio ; plus domestic vs international; (3) Field for 4 sectors i.e. firm, household, government and other; and (4) Field for 9 sectors i.e. more detailed firm level capital flows for agriculture, commerce and trade, manufacturing, financial services, tourism, etc.. Hence, the dataset is idea for multi-level empirical work.

We will report fully on these at the next round.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C994922F-F4EB-42C2-BD4A-EC12364ADD6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Mixed Methods</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N013344/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>DCC73A93-3EC4-42C2-A511-3934E7E0EC60</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N013344/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>1726450.22</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-05-23</gtr:start><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>2CAE3C4F-1A12-4908-8B2B-54CB76F69A93</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/N013344/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>1555939.44</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2020-05-22</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>BA017EDD-C008-4338-ABE2-A7D9EEA68E82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F0E99303-35B5-4458-9B00-D93E2E075C9F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Finance and Accounting</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>71E94BA5-333E-4F49-9ECA-60771CC7532E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
