The immune response then attempts to kill the invading bacteria. In most cases the immune response is successful. In some cases, though, the immune response fails to kill the invader, and the invading bacteria can become established and grow in the host. When this happens, disease is the result. In many diseases, including tuberculosis, the immune response is not shut off by the bacteria; instead, it is active, but ineffective at killing the invader. In these cases, most of the damage caused by the disease is not caused by the bacteria directly; rather, the damage is caused by this ineffective immune response. The goal of this proposal is to understand how disease-causing bacteria can escape the immune response and become established in the host, and how immune responses, which are supposed to just kill invaders, can instead come to cause so much damage to the host. In order to examine these issues, we developed a new system for the study of infection. In this system, a bacterium called Mycobacterium marinum, which is closely related to the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, is injected into a fruit-fly (Drosophila melanogaster). This system is very useful because much of the immune response to bacteria is similar between flies and higher animals, such as humans or cattle. At the same time, we know a great deal about flies, and have excellent tools for working with them, so that we can easily find flies with mutations that make them more- or less-efficient at fighting this infection, or mutations that make the infection less damaging to the fly. Using these techniques, we can find genes that are important for fighting infections or that cause the damage due to the immune response. These genes are difficult to find in higher organisms, such as mice, because the process is very time-consuming and involves many animals. For example, in order to do the experiments in this proposal in mice would take more than ten years and more than 10,000 mice. The fly allows us to study these genes rapidly and cheaply, without the ethical issues inherent in the use of mice or other mammals.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>My laboratory is interested in the mechanisms by which hosts affect the course of bacterial infections. This includes immune effects, both in terms of eradicating the pathogen and in terms of causing unintended damage to the host. To address these issues, I developed a model system in which Drosophila melanogaster is infected with the broad-spectrum pathogen Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative of the M. tuberculosis complex. This system allows us to find host genes that contribute to the biology of infection in a rapid and unbiased way without using vertebrate animals. I propose to continue and expand a genetic screen I began as a post-doc. The initial screen was for Drosophila mutants that died more quickly or more slowly after M. marinum infection. This screen will be continued and coupled with a second screen for mutants that are unable to fight a non-pathogenic mycobacterial species, M. smegmatis. By screening all mutants for susceptibility to both bacteria we can find genes that contribute to bacterial pathogenesis, help the host kill mycobacteria, or are circumvented by pathogens in order to cause disease. This work has three specific aims: Aim 1. Continuation and expansion of the already-begun genetic screen. We will screen at least 5000 mutant Drosophila lines for changes in time-to-death when infected with M. marinum and susceptibility to M. smegmatis. Aim 2. Secondary screens and basic characterization of many mutants. All mutants from the primary screen will be subjected to a battery of secondary screens to help us organize them into functional classes. Aim 3. Deeper characterization of at least one specific mutant. At least one mutant will be characterized in detail. This work is important and exciting because it affords us an unbiased view of what host processes are important to disease susceptibility and the progress of pathogenesis, important questions that are difficult to answer using more conventional infection models.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>380233</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>289521</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Project Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/L/020122/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>A2E283BE-7F00-45AF-AD87-A826C69FBACF</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>276000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>A novel role for wnt4 in regulation of insulin signalling and metabolism in vivo.</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Wellcome Trust Ltd</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>WT085119MA</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>FB3E6977-DA50-4E06-B8F4-8D484D7364CB</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>111000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Physiological integration of TNF- and Interleukin-like signals</gtr:description><gtr:end>2013-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Nuffield Foundation</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>8890F41B-A36E-4F88-8648-F15335C313E9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2009-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>32000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>CASE studentship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>BB/L502169/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BF9128B6-1840-4180-AECC-337F3C530BBD</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>402320</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Grant</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>?MR/L018802/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>B85D9B26-1C4E-452A-94B5-28C179B26AAD</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our findings have had significant scientific impact; commercial impact is still some time away, as our work is very much basic science.

We identified 35 new Drosophila genes with effects on susceptibility to mycobacterial disease. These genes encode proteins in many different functional categories. Many of them are intriguing and unexpected candidates for genes that alter tuberculosis disease progression in humans.



2. We made significant progress in analyzing three of these genes in the course of this work:

 mad: the effect of mad on mycobacterial susceptibility revealed unexpected roles of two different TGF-beta superfamily members as immunoregulatory cytokines in Drosophila. This work is important for several reasons. First, it sheds light on the comparative function of TGF-betas in immunity. Nothing was previously known about this in organisms other than mammals. Second, it reveals an unexpected heterogeneity in the function of Drosophila blood cells: this work is the first evidence that some blood cells in the fly inhibit immune responses, as is seen in mammals. This work has been published.



 Mef2: we are currently analyzing the function of the transcription factor Mef2 in Drosophila immunity. We have found that Mef2 is required for both immune and metabolic functions in the fly. Moreover, we find that Mef2 activity is a critical determinant of immune-induced wasting in the fly, and we have hints that this function is conserved in humans. As cachexia is a significant driver of human morbidity and mortality in infections, autoimmune disease and cancer, this work has significant translational implications. We are currently working hard to put the finishing touches on this work (we currently expect this to be published within the next 9 months).



 SC35: we have strong evidence that SC35 is a previously-unrecognized component of the imd signalling pathway in fly immunity and the TNF signalling pathway in human inflammation. As TNF is a critical driver of pathology in autoimmune disease and is also required in humans for effective immune responses, new regulators of this pathway have significant translational implications.



 It should be noted that all three of these genes, and much of the subsequent analysis, depended on the screening funded by BBSRC.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings will require some academic validation before becoming commercializable, but we can easily envision these genes, or others identified in our screens, as targets for drug therapies against tuberculosis or other infections in humans and animals. By targeting the host rather than the microbe in infections, we may be able to circumvent the problems of drug resistance that bedevil antibiotic discovery. In terms of the three genes we have thoroughly characterized, two have clear translational potential: SC35 as a TNF regulator, and Mef2 as a core regulator of immune-metabolic crosstalk in inflammation, infection and cancer. If these genes can be targeted by drugs, we may be able to inhibit a wide variety of pathologies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D9A6B14E-6403-4980-8A57-CB12BAF58E4E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We developed techniques to integrate computational predictions of biological function for transcription factors with experimental functional analysis.
