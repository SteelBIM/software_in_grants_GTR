It will advance our understanding of the ways in which, not just Brecht, but foreign literatures in general and across the full range of genres, negotiate cultural difference. It will result in major research publications, both in articles and special issues of internationally respected journals and in significant additions to the corpus of Brecht's writings in the English language. It will also provide integrated opportunities for cultural interchange with non-academic institutions through a programme of workshops and the like.
Brecht is, internationally, one of the most performed of all writers for the theatre, often accounted second only to Shakespeare. His work is of huge significance for the professional theatre, in Britain and elsewhere, as well as for schools and drama colleges. At the same time, his cultural theoretical writings underpin work in media and cultural studies (esp. film) and in the development of a critical cultural theory. And, thirdly, he is widely recognised as the most important German poet of the twentieth century and enjoys an international reputation as one the greatest of Modernist poets. The translation, edition and transmission of the works of such an author in the English language is as important as that of Freud or Marx, e.g., yet it has been the subject of little critical analysis and engagement. 'Brecht into English' aims to set that right, by engaging an international network of leading Brecht scholars to reflect critically on the processes of translation and cultural transmission in the English-speaking world, both in the theatre and in print, and finally to contribute key volumes to the ongoing critical edition in English of Brecht's huge and varied oeuvre.
The project will be coordinated by Dr Tom Kuhn who, as an editor of the 'Methuen Drama' Brecht list (some 40 titles) since 1996, has enjoyed a privileged overview of Brecht translation and reception. He is one of the leading scholars of Brecht in the English-speaking world, with numerous publications. Having, over decades, nurtured relationships, not only with Brecht scholars, but also with the Brecht heirs (the copyright holders) and with the relevant publishers, Dr Kuhn has persuaded the interested parties to embark on several important new publications: a thoroughly revised Brecht on Theatre and a further volume, Brecht on Performance (much of the material appearing in English for the first time) which together will complete the 4-vol. set of theoretical writings; an entirely new 5-vol. edition of the Collected Poems; and a critical edition of the Berliner Ensemble Adaptations, to complete the 9-vol. Collected Plays. The translators, editors and other scholars assembled in this context represent a Core Team, poised to exploit an exciting opportunity to reflect both on the pragmatics of translation and on theories of intercultural exchange.
Central questions about the practices of translation, adaptation and cultural hybridity will be addressed in workshops and conferences. It is expected that the project will attract the International Brecht Society's (triennial) conference to Britain in 2016 on the theme 'Recycling Brecht'. There will be an exchange with theatre practitioners, led by the director Di Trevis, which will feed directly into the planned publications and into a parallel cultural programme. The project will have outputs, not only in the critical editions enumerated above, but also in special issues of major publications, including the Brecht Yearbook, research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and, finally, workshop protocols and films.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The importance of Brecht in the theatres and schools of the world and of his writings for cultural criticism and critical theory generally, makes Brecht in English arguably more important than Brecht in German. English, as well as its more obvious national bases, is the language through which Brecht is mediated to the Indian sub-continent, to much of Africa, and even to the Far East. The mediation of Brecht's work through reliable translations, in book form and in the theatre, makes a crucial contribution to the cultural life of the English-speaking community worldwide, as well as of the nation more narrowly conceived. He is the greatest dramatist of the twentieth century in any language, and one of the most accessible representatives of the culture of our most important European neighbour. His writings take us straight to the central questions of twentieth-century European history and act as discussion pieces about fascism and communism. Beyond this, Brecht is one of the few classic and widely studied authors who engages directly with economic and political questions: the very existence of these texts helps to nurture an economically and politically educated public.
The study of the way in which such writings are transmitted is designed not just to critique past and present cultural presumptions, but also to inform future work, both on Brecht and on other European classics. Beyond this, the impact of a new edition of a major writer's works will always be great, and felt most significantly by scholars and students working in the area. The interdisciplinary nature of Brecht's oeuvre, however, in several media and genres, means that the reach of this project will be far greater and stretch well outside the academic community. Brecht's work is widely taught in schools too, as a part of Theatre Studies, German and History courses. The proposed editions will furnish new material for exploitation in all sorts of pedagogic contexts. The new edition of Brecht on Theatre, e.g., for which worldwide exclusive rights are secured, is projected to sell 3000 a year. Brecht is a mainstay of the Methuen Drama list, and we can expect these books to be in print for decades.
Brecht's work is also of great importance for the theatre, indeed he is often accounted, worldwide after Shakespeare, the second most performed author. These editions contain important texts. The Adaptations volume, for example, will undoubtedly be taken up, especially as it includes versions of two English classics (Shakespeare's Coriolanus and Farquhar's Trumpets and Drums). The theory volumes are likewise of importance for work in drama colleges and theatres, containing Brecht's significant statements on Epic Theatre, Verfremdung and Gestus. The Messingkauf is a hybrid between theory and theatre, and has several times been staged in German; our edition will make it possible to do that in English too. As for the Poems, Brecht's standing as a poet is growing all the time but his poetry is insufficiently known in English. The publication in 1978 of Willett's Poems volume was hailed as a hugely significant moment by critics such as Stephen Spender, George Steiner and Kenneth Tynan. The new Poems volumes will have a similar impact on the poetry reading and writing community.
Dr Kuhn has long been committed to communicating his work beyond an academic audience and, above all, to ensuring that good translations and editions are made accessible to a wide audience. He has worked closely with translators and directors, as well as with publishers. He has spoken in schools and theatres, participated in workshops, and contributed to theatre programmes and radio broadcasts. The Core Team for this project and the Advisory Board have been recruited with an eye to exploiting contacts with the theatre and poetry worlds, and reaching out to new (non-academic) audiences through a cultural programme of workshops, readings, talks and performances.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>420127</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Translations into English by David Constantine of poems by Brecht, published in international journal Modern Poetry in Translation: The Constellation, no. 2 (2014)</gtr:description><gtr:id>D2EF0E57-FE63-4DB2-A95D-3CFC0F0FAFE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>These poems were the central focus of this issue of Modern Poetry in Translation, and were part of a social media campaign in summer 2014 that generated increased interest in Brecht's poetry across the world.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Brecht translations by David Constantine</gtr:title><gtr:type>Creative Writing</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.mptmagazine.com/poem/love-in-a-time-of-exile-and-war-689/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Translation of Brecht's poems.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EF3FC6D3-78F6-461D-BC26-2AB674C1E755</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Various poetry events, including 'Love in a Time of Exile and War' at the Southbank, 19 July 2014.

- Input into the North Wall's Symposium for Young Theatre Practitioners (June 2016)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The North Wall provides considerable staff time and expertise in steering the production of Fatzer, and advising the producer and co-director. It also provides facilities and performance space for 'Fatzer', which, having been fostered by the North Wall, will go on to have a longer run at London's Finborough Theatre. Through hosting this production, the North Wall ensures that the Brecht text translated by the PI will have wide reach among young theatre practitioners and a public audience, lending it increased cultural impact. The production fostered by the North Wall will also, in turn, influence and contribute to a published volume of Brecht fragments, due to be brought out by Bloomsbury in due course.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The collaboration with the North Wall is an ambitious new partnership to stage a production of Brecht's dramatic fragment 'Johann Fatzer, the Downfall of an Egoist' a text that has never before been translated into or performed in English. The PI, Tom Kuhn, has translated and reconstituted a version of this text, drawing on research at the Brecht Archive in Berlin, that will form the basis of a production that will take place at the North Wall in June. The production is timed to coincide with the 15th Symposium of the International Brecht Society, and will feed into a Symposium for young theatre practitioners held at the North Wall at the same time. The research team has contributed funds and considerable artistic input to the production, most significantly in translating and advising on the script. The production at the North Wall is mentored by veteran Brecht director Di Trevis (who has previously worked for the RSC and National Theatre) and Dominic Muldowney (former head of music at the National Theatre). The research team will also contribute to the North Wall's Symposium for young theatre practitioners by forging connections between the theatre and speakers at the 15th IBS Symposium, who will be invited to take part in talks and workshops at the North Wall.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Berlin Academy of Arts (ADK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>BBA</gtr:description><gtr:id>6BD22A85-3330-49CE-88EB-BF1E8A5DAB19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Mutual contributions to catalogues and databases.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Picture and manuscript research</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Picture and manuscript research</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2006-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Recycling Brecht: 15th Symposium of the International Brecht Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>54F2F3B0-A01C-4602-9F34-D83C1497C078</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The International Brecht Society (IBS) and the Writing Brecht project at the University of Oxford, in association with the Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities (TORCH), hosted scholars and artists in theatre, performance, and other cultural fields at the 15th IBS Symposium on 'Recycling Brecht' from June 25-29, 2016.
Some 150 Brecht specialists attended the symposium, with over 100 papers on 'Recycling Brecht'. These were on themes including: Brecht Abroad (from South America to the Indian subcontinent); Brecht as Recycler (with special sessions on the Modelbooks and the Lehrst&amp;uuml;ck); Brecht in recent and contemporary German theatre (including Castorf's Baal scandal); filmic, visual and technological recycling; Teaching Brecht; and Brecht and Translation.
Keynote speakers were Amal Allana (longtime theatre director and former chairperson, National School of Theatre, India), Hans Thies Lehmann (theorist of postdramatic theatre and former President of the IBS) and Pulitzer Prize-winning dramatist and translator Tony Kushner.

These four types are not entirely distinct; some events have seen a mixing of these approaches and have fed directly into general audience publications. Altogether this work has stimulated further intellectual engagement with Brecht's work (both for the research team and amongst the general public) and with forms of political and socially engag&amp;eacute; literature beyond that of Brecht alone.

We are continuing to build on the practical performance side of the project, which has both proved a fruitful source of research and has helped to bring Brecht's work to a wider public. Our collaboration with the North Wall Theatre, which hosted an original production of Brecht's dramatic fragment 'Fatzer', brought one of Brecht's works that has never before been translated into or performed in English to a public audience. The play was also performed in part in Minneapolis, where a full production is planned, disseminating the project's work among an even wider group of viewers. A production of another untranslated unstaged piece, 'Jae Fleischhacker', is also in planning.

We have built up an impressive public profile, both through being listed for major national and international Poetry in Translation prizes (the Popescu Prize and the PEN Award for Poetry in Translation) and featuring on major media channels including the BBC, the Guardian and the New Yorker. 

We have also created a following, both in the form of a mailing list and via Facebook (www.facebook.com/writingbrecht) and Twitter (twitter.com/writingbrecht), and have initiated an active correspondence with the interested public nationally and internationally. Our website and the various films of the project activities which it hosts get an impressive number of hits.

We will continue to strive to widen participation in these activities and debates, so as to reach not only the 'literary festival public', poetry readers and schools, but also a more general audience with interest in poetry, theatre and the arts, as well as 'harder to reach' groups (we are developing a project with a homeless charity).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4AA4A5BD-5BDC-4003-BE16-36831C9A012E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our key findings cover the areas of poetry, and theatre and aesthetic theory. In Poetry we have found the following:
1) The history of the translation of Brecht's poetry reveals ways in which successive generations have adapted their own versions to accord, both with their own political and ideological interests and - more interestingly - with the fashionable currents of contemporary poetry in their own languages and countries. 2) Brecht is revealed as a poet of Eros, almost as much as a political poet. 3) The ambiguity of concretes and abstractions in German reveals, in the process of translation, ambiguities in Brecht's thought (esp. on the moral absolutism/relativism divide). 4) Our investigation of the specifics of German-English poetry translation are beginning to point us towards general conclusions about the translation of metre and multi-syllable rhyme.

In Theatre and aesthetic theory we have found the following:
1) The bringing together of performance theory and performance practice has uncovered some fascinating ambiguities in Brecht's writing, especially in the writings of the Messingkauf/Buying Brass. 2) The innovative juxtaposition of the Messingkauf and Modelbooks (in Brecht on Performance) has been particularly suggestive. Performance is revealed as a category that can be critically 'read' (not just experienced) and from that study a more generalised understanding of a theatrical approach may be induced. And theory, in turn, is transformed and rendered experiential.
