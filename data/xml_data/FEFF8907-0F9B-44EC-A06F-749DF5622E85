Our Centre tackles a major problem in modern medicine - the lack of any therapies that promote repair in the clinic. At present, a trip to the doctor will lead to a drug to limit the damage from getting worse, but nothing to repair the damage already done. This lack of regenerative therapies is a huge societal and medical problem - for example in Multiple Sclerosis it causes the majority of the 10 billion Euro annual cost of the disease. 

To develop this new class of drugs we need to study stem cells, the immortal cells present in many of our tissues that can generate all the cells required for repair. Despite spectacular advances in our understanding of their properties when growing in dishes in the lab, however, we still know very little about what controls their behaviour in tissues, and particularly in tissues damaged by disease or scarring. It is this problem that represents the starting point of our Centre's quest for new treatments.

To tackle this problem we bring together scientists who can address all of the specific questions we need to consider - how do stem cells react to damage, how is their proliferation regulated in tissues, can we increase this proliferation by drugs or by transplanting in new cells and, even if we do, will these new cells be incorporated into and repair the damaged tissue? We also need to partner these scientists with technologists and doctors able to develop our discoveries into products and then try them out in special clinics where very small numbers of highly-selected patients are given these experimental treatments to see if they work. 

In working on this, we have two other very important goals. First, we need to train the next generation of clinical and non-clinical scientists in this field so as to ensure that the investment made is sustainable. We select the brightest and the best each year for our PhD programme and provide them with a state-of-the-art training in all areas of stem cells and regenerative medicine, and then help them start their own independent careers. Second, we need to tell the public and politicians what it is we do and why it is important. For this, we have a an Outreach programme (the best in Europe) that provides accurate information on all aspects of stem cells via the press, the web and in person - a vital role to ensure that misconceptions about stem cells are not allowed to spoil the promise of this most exciting area of science.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The proposed research of the Centre over the next 5 years is comprised of three parts. 

First, our research programmes addressing key gaps in fundamental knowledge (tissue stem cells, plutipotent stem cells, niche composition and regulation, activation of tissue stem cells, stem cell differentiation and reprogramming), translation (drug-based therapies, cell-based therapies, disease modelling) and clinical application (cell therapies for liver disease, regenerative neurology) that represent the continuation of our activities catalysed by the initial Centre award - these programmes are now funded by programme and project grants. 

Second, the new collaborations and strategic initiatives we propose to achieve our ambition of being world-leading in the field of stem cell and tissues - it is to create these new collaborations and initiatives for which we seek MRC support in this renewal application. 

Third, the new translational and clinical platforms for which we propose to leverage our MRC Centre status, and the explicit recognition by the MRC of our ambition, to generate additional funding from other sources. These are an academic cell therapy unit and an endogenous repair platform to contribute to the UK Regenerative medicine platform and a new clinical programme in cardiovascular regeneration in partnership with the BHF. 

From this research we will deliver a detailed understanding of the array of external and internal signals that instruct stem cell behaviour and tissue formation, show how disease modifies these signals and identify the steps in the regenerative process at which repair then fails. Using this knowledge, we will generate better animal- and iPS-based models of relevant diseases. We will use these to devise strategies to promote regeneration that we will test in first-in-man clinical trials, so using our facilities and our vision to deliver the crucial next impacts in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the short term our work will impact on

1) Commercial organizations ranging from spin-outs using our expertise or IP (eg Roslin Cells or FibroMed) to larger companies with whom we will develop partnerships around areas of specific knowledge eg iPS cells. We see the latter as a particularly important potential impact to address the rapidly declining number of new drugs emerging from the Pharma pipeline. The complexity of safety, regulatory and other hurdles that need to be overcome means that a new drug now costs upward of &amp;pound;1 billion to develop and bring to market. This combination of rising costs and diminishing products is not sustainable, and new technologies are required to improve efficiency. The increased use of ES or iPS-derived human cells provides such a technology.

2) The public, for whom our communications strategy provides accurate information on a range of stem cell-related issues. As an exemplar, there is a need to distinguish the difference between cell replacement strategies based on stem cells and those based on trophic effects of (any) cell transplant. The failure to distinguish these underpins much stem cell tourism and highlights the need for professional outreach programmes such as that in CRM.

3) Policy makers, to whom we provide advice on the opportunities and threats created by stem cell medicine in the life science sector - one of five targeted areas for development in the Scottish economy and a key part of the wider UK economy.

In the longer term the key beneficiaries will be 

1) Patients with diseases such as liver cirrhosis, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. While the identification of neural and other tissue stem cells raises the hope that previously unattainable restoration of other adult organs damaged by disease, trauma or aging can be achieved, there are at present very few regenerative therapies in the clinic - doctors prescribe drugs to limit damage, but none to enhance repair. Such regenerative therapies, which ight be either cell- or drug-based, represent a major unmet need.

2) Blood transfusion services. Our research to create red blood cells from human stem cells offers the prospect of limitless quantities of safe blood without the need for extensive donor programmes.

2) Pharmaceutical companies. Regenerative medicines provide a substantial potential market for Pharma companies in the UK and beyond - estimated to be at least $35bn by as soon as 2018.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1940668</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hope Beyond Hype II: Scottish Stem Cell Stories</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EECF839-7A12-4CD4-99DC-6FF022358F1B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hope Beyond Hype II: Scottish Stem Cell Stories project (Sept 2013 - Nov 2014).

The three day cultural festival is aimed at families and young adults. A dedicated area, Einstein's Garden, offers visitors the unique opportunity to brush up their science and engage with researchers from many different areas. Despite the bad weather, our team of stem cell specialists engaged with 1,500+ visitors. Using a newly developed 'Dr Skelfie and the Stem Cell Team' exhibit people were encouraged to make nerve cells for DrSkelfie, a skeleton, in the 'stem cell lab' using sim cards, electrical wiring and insulation tape. The conversation starter activity naturally led to further deep level engagement with many visitors. In addition to the exhibit, we also took part in the Human Library project and developed a Stem Cell Ceilidh dance for the science ceilidh band. Part of the display work was developed by Edinburgh College of Art student Ellen Adams. The exhibit was developed by PhD students Eleni Karagianni, Julia Watson and Antoniana Batsivari.

A new series of thought-provoking cinema screenings, which probe into issues surrounding regenerative medicine, will take place in Edinburgh this autumn.
The Filmosophy: Regeneration season will put a spotlight on ethical topics raised in the films shown - such as the use of stem cells and genetic modification - during post-screening discussions with experts from the University of Edinburgh. 
The series takes place at Edinburgh's Filmhouse from 8 September until 8 December, and is delivered in association with Short Courses at the University of Edinburgh and the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine. 
The season begins on Tuesday 8 September with Never Let Me Go, based on Kazuo Ishiguro's best-selling novel, it is a story of love and loss that deals with the ethics of human cloning for medical purposes. Professor Charles ffrench-Constant, Director of the MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, will take part in the post-screening discussion. 
The critically-acclaimed I Am Breathing, which follows the story of Motor Neuron Disease-sufferer Neil Platt during the last few months of his life, will be shown in October. The film was co-directed by Emma Davie, Programme Director of Film and TV at Edinburgh College of Art and Morag McKinnon and was produced by Sonja Henrici of the Scottish Documentary Institute.
Further screenings include Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain, featuring three intertwining tales about men in pursuit of eternal life, and Pedro Almodovar's The Skin I Live In, a warped and creepy revenge thriller in which a plastic surgeon (Antonio Banderas) is obsessed with his latest revolutionary skin treatment. 
James Mooney, Lecturer in Film and Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, said: &amp;quot;We are delighted to partner with the CRM to curate this original programme. As well as offering a fresh perspective on the films, it is an opportunity to showcase some of the ground-breaking research taking place in Edinburgh right now. The scientists involved in the discussions are world-leaders in their field, and I am looking forward to what should be a stimulating and powerful debate on the ethics of stem cell research.&amp;quot;
Artwork by Hamer Dodds, artist-in-residence for the Centre for Regenerative Medicine, will accompany the Regeneration season. His exhibition of microscopic cell images and drawings are on show at the Edinburgh Filmhouse throughout September.

The Edinburgh Med Chi is an old society (founded in 1821) which meets monthly during the University term time for lectures and occasional formal dinners. Their members are drawn from all medical specialities (eg physicians, cardiac surgeons, psychiatrists and GPs) and quite a number are retired. One of the members had attended our meeting and said it was a 'most inspiring and enjoyable meeting - the best he had been for ages' and he had recommended my introductory talk for the EdMedChi programme. The meeting was arranged for Fri 20 March at 7.30pm (held at Lifecare, Stockbridge House, Edinburgh) - there were about 30 members present and I spoke for 30 mins with a Q and A session afterwards.

The project aims to provide teachers, particularly in remote areas of Scotland, with up-to-date knowledge of stem cells and free teaching resources for use in their classrooms. As such the project has organised CPD training sessions and has delivered schools workshops with these materials to further help teachers deliver these sessions themselves afterwards. Full data are not available yet, but to date we have delivered workshops (740 pupils total) in Shetland (180 pupils), Orkney (105 pupils), Thurso (160 pupils), Skye (90 pupils), Fort William (80 pupils), Dumfries (65 pupils), Dunoon (60 pupils), Outer Hebrides (Lewis, Benbecula, Barra, number of pupils unknown), and some local schools in Scotland's central belt area. In these areas (and others) we have thus far delivered 16 CPD training sessions, with 79 teachers attending from 46 different schools. 48 kits with educational materials have been distributed after the CPD training session. In addition we organised a GLOW digital CPD training session, which 50 teachers attended.

Jane Taylor was invited to talk about stem cells and regenerative medicine. &amp;quot;The secretary of the Edinburgh Medico-Chirurgical Society (http://www.edmedchi.co.uk ) wrote to me after the May 2014 stem cell summer school we held for GPs and clinicians (Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine: Current Status and Future Prospects) inviting me to talk to their members about stem cells and regenerative medicine. The Edinburgh Med Chi is an old society (founded in 1821) which meets monthly during the University term time for lectures and occasional formal dinners. Their members are drawn from all medical specialities (eg physicians, cardiac surgeons, psychiatrists and GPs) and quite a number are retired. One of the members had attended our meeting and said it was a 'most inspiring and enjoyable meeting - the best he had been for ages' and he had recommended my introductory talk for the EdMedChi programme. The meeting was arranged for Fri 20 March at 7.30pm (held at Lifecare, Stockbridge House, Edinburgh) - there were about 30 members present and I spoke for 30 mins with a Q and A session afterwards. There was a very lively discussion at the end with lots of questions. I gave them the Eurostemcell web address and the CRM address for further information.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ASME 2014 3rd Global Congress on NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology,Feb. 2-5, 2014, San Francisco, CA.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>964F569B-7035-423C-8F25-2E1F8F51275A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Molly Stevens keynote presentation &amp;quot;New Materials-Based Approaches for Regenerative Medicine&amp;quot;
