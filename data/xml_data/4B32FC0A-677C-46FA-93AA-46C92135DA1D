Bees provide an essential pollination service for crops and wild plants in sustainable agriculture. Bee products, such as honey, wax and propolis also have a substantial international market. It is therefore essential that we develop a comprehensive understanding of bees' responses to diseases, parasites and the rapidly changing environment if we are to predict their future health and survival. This understanding is vital for informing hive and landscape management strategies to ensure that the sustainability of populations can be maintained. Bees living in agricultural landscapes must respond to sudden changes in forage availability over time and space whilst dealing with a variety of diseases, parasites and other potential stressors resulting from management of the landscape (such as exposure to pesticides). Most previous studies have focussed either on the effect of disease, parasites, or hive management on bees; or on the influence of foraging resources. This joint project, between Rothamsted and Warwick HRI in partnership with Syngenta, takes a novel ecological systems-based approach of combining the different factors that are likely to affect honeybee survival, using modelling tools to allow prediction in different landscapes and under different conditions, and allowing the exploration of interactions between factors. A) We will firstly do a systematic survey and assessment of patterns within the substantial datasets and models that are available to us on honeybee colony growth and survival in response to pathogens (e.g. viruses), parasites (e.g. Varroa destructor mites) and other pests. We will also collate and develop models that predict forager distributions. B) Focusing on the factors most likely to be important from the pattern analysis, we will then develop a new individual-based model to predict colony growth and survival by incorporating the potentially interacting effects of disease or parasite load, landscape type and resource availability. This integrated model will be built to test the hypothesis that honeybee colony growth and survival can be predicted from the combined influence of pathogens and parasites and the effects of landscape factors such as food availability. C) Field experiments designed to measure the interaction between disease and forage availability will be performed to allow the model to be tested and the outputs to be verified. The results of these experiments, and the modelling, will provide us with an insight into the varying significance of disease and resource-related factors on the survival of bees in arable landscapes, and allow us to predict the bees' response to changes in farming practices or disease thresholds. We are not alone in addressing the challenge of what is affecting honeybee populations across the world. In contrast to other studies - our proposal is to integrate the usually separate disciplines of studying foraging behaviour outside the hive with what is affecting the bees within the hive in order to provide a practical tool which should enable us to predict how bee colonies will respond in terms of foraging patterns and colony growth in a variety of cropped landscapes. This project aims to capitalise on previous BBSRC-funded work by the applicants, which has examined the effects of landscapes on bee foraging behaviour and survival. This work will substantially increase our ability to predict and manipulate the impacts of agricultural practices and beekeeping management on these essential and economically important pollinators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>For Obj 1: Systematically scan existing datasets and models showing the effects of pathogens and parasites on honeybee colony growth and survival. This pattern analysis will identify key parameters and interactions for building a model of the effect of varroa, viruses, other diseases and hive management on colony development and survival. For Obj 2: Experimentally examine the distribution of honeybee foragers away from colonies with differing 'health' status (using mark-re-observation, waggle dance analysis and pollen analysis) to measure the effect of disease or parasite load on foraging behaviour patterns. Results will be used to build a forager model (Obj 3). For Obj 3: Compile existing data to build a model, based on energetic and behavioural parameters, to predict how honeybee foragers utilise the landscape when resources are patchy. This model can be used as a standalone output to predict the distribution of bees in the landscape; but it will also be used in Obj 4. For Obj 4: Develop a novel integrated model which combines effects of 'within hive' regulation (diseases etc) with the effects of landscape factors (forage availability) on the survival and strength of honeybee colonies. The model will be developed using an individual-based approach (IBM), using the colony model and forager model (from 1 &amp;amp; 3 above) and will provide a tool for predicting honeybee colony survival and resource utilisation under different conditions. For Obj 5: Experimentally test the relative importance of, and interaction between, disease load and food availability on honeybee colony growth and strength. Experiments will involve placing colonies of different known disease/parasite load in the field and giving them differential access to foraging resources. Colony development will be monitored through the season to examine which factors are most influential in affecting colony growth. Results will be used to validate the model from Obj 4.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>765591</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Syngenta</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Syngenta Ltd (Bracknell)</gtr:department><gtr:description>IPA partnership: Industrial Partner</gtr:description><gtr:id>8701ADCE-4BCC-47B9-8AEC-A44D4F6C8969</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Becher et al (2013) J Applied Ecology

The project has resulted in substantial public engagement; liaison with political decision-makers and good interactions with industrial stakeholders, all of which increase the impact of the outcomes amongst groups who make decisions about policy and land management, as well as those keeping honeybee colonies.
The publication of the Becher models has resulted in the following impact so far:

1) Regulators
BEEHAVE was presented to the Pesticide Working Group of EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) in 2015, who carried out &amp;quot;a stepwise evaluation of the BEEHAVE simulation model with a view to assessing its suitability for use in a regulatory context and for risk assessment of multiple stressors at the landscape level.&amp;quot; The 90 page report (EFSA Journal, 2015) stated that &amp;quot;The Panel recommends that BEEHAVE should be adopted as the basis for modelling the impact on honeybee colonies of pesticides and other stressors&amp;quot;. The EPA (Environment Protection Agency) in USA is also considering use of BEEHAVE for pesticide regulation.

2) Industry
BEEHAVE is being used by three agrochemical industries to explore and model exposure of bees to pesticides (Syngenta, Bayer, BASF)

3) Beekeepers
We ran three workshops for beekeepers, teaching them how to use BEEHAVE; loaded a bespoke beekeeper interface to the website; developed the BEEMAPP app for their use and publicised the work in the national bee press. Several beekeepers are now advocates.

4) Education
BEEHAVE is being used as a virtual classroom in two courses in higher Education Colleges in the USA.

5) Academics in the USA, France, Germany and the UK are using BEEHAVE and the Facebook group has over 100 followers keen to use it to test different scenarios of honeybee hive management.

6) Policy-makers and land managers: These key stakeholder groups have highlighted the need for tools to demonstrate how land management options impact on pollinators, so future development of the models will be for use by those advising on, and implementing, habitat management in policy and practice.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A1284A9A-FAD5-45D6-9968-8CC1BD914791</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Current widespread concerns about honeybee health and survival mean it is essential that we develop a comprehensive understanding of their responses to diseases, parasites, forage and pesticides if we are to predict and manage their health and survival. This joint project between Rothamsted and Warwick, in partnership with Syngenta, took a novel ecological systems-based approach, using models and experiments, to explore and predict the relative importance of, and interactions between, the multitude of factors that affect colony strength and survival in arable landscapes. We integrated the usually separate disciplines of foraging behaviour studies outside the hive with what affects bees within the hive.

BEEHAVE:
We evaluated published honeybee models: none considered the multitude of important environmental variables - and this was published as a review (Becher et al 2013).

We designed and built a new integrated model, BEEHAVE, incorporating 1) honeybee colony dynamics, 2) varroa mite and virus dynamics, 3) foraging dynamics and 4) a spatially explicit representation of the landscape. BEEHAVE can be used to predict the survival and strength of a colony over time in response to different levels of disease, forage availability or pesticide exposure (for example). It is based on difference equations and the foraging sub-module is agent-based. Full sensitivity analyses and validation have been done. BEEHAVE with a detailed model description and user manual will be published with open access to the code (Becher et al 2014). It is a practical tool with a user-friendly interface that is available to scientists, beekeepers and other stakeholders to compare scenarios of management and environmental change.

We collected experimental evidence of the interacting effects of varroa load, viral load and forage availability on honeybee colony survival in arable landscapes. We demonstrated that varroa load had the greatest effect on survival, although access to forage also affected colony growth, and could mitigate the effects of high varroa loads.

We have achieved the aims of the project: providing insight into the significance of disease and resource-related factors on bee survival, and a model to predict bee's responses to changes in farming practices or disease thresholds. In summary, BEEHAVE simulations and landscape scale experiments show that 1) of the factors tested so far, varroa load is most critical to colony health; 2) if colonies in UK arable farmland do not &amp;quot;capitalise&amp;quot; on major nectar flows, then their chances of survival through winter are low; 3) availability of plentiful forage can potentially mitigate against the effects of varroa.

BEESCOUT calculates the size and location of these potential food sources in that landscape relative to a bee colony. An individual-based model then determines the detection probabilities of the food patches by bees, based on parameter values gathered from the flight patterns of honeybees and bumblebees. Various &amp;quot;search modes&amp;quot; describe hypothetical search strategies for the long-range exploration of scouting bees. The resulting detection probabilities of forage patches can be used as input for the recently developed honeybee model BEEHAVE, to explore realistic scenarios of colony growth and death in response to different stressors.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6199E100-3624-49C5-BA26-499572EDD2C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Still in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>BEESCOUT model</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.beehave-model.net</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>BEEHAVE integrates colony dynamics, population dynamics of the varroa mite, epidemiology of varroa-transmitted viruses and allows foragers in an agent-based foraging model to collect food from a representation of a spatially explicit landscape.
