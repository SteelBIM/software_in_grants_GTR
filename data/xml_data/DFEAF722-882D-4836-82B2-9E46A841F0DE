Performativities and Ecocultural Ethics in a Globalised African Landscape</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K005871/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project investigates how different ideas of the past, in particular imagined past relationships between people and nature, are conditioning the futures being urgently created now in pursuit of 'sustainability' and the avoidance of 'environmental crisis'. It explores tensions between traditional, indigenous and local conceptions of human/nature relationships, on the one hand, and new conceptions underlying modern market-based methods for creating 'green' futures, on the other. We will do this through in-depth field research in western Namibia - where three of our team members have long-term research experience - and in collaboration with our local institutional partner, the National Museum of Namibia.

Problems such as 'environmental change' and 'sustainability' are complex and require analysis that crosses disciplinary boundaries. Our research, therefore, applies methods and theory from Cultural Geography, Ethnomusicology, Environmental History, Philosophy and Social Anthropology. Our field location encapsulates tensions present in many contemporary circumstances. Here, old and new conceptions of human/nature relationships are colliding spectacularly as resources such as uranium are extracted from land which is home to some of the oldest cultures on earth, as well as to highly valued (and endangered) animal and plant species. 

Through engaging with diverse actors in corporate, state, NGO and local contexts, we will explore the environmental change understandings informing a range of new 'green' entities that are being created, marketed and exchanged so as to generate sustainability. We will juxtapose these 'sustainability objects' with ways that landscape and other species are conceived and remembered in local indigenous culture, as encoded in stories, song, dance and healing rituals. Our selected, interconnected and commodified 'green things' are, i) 'green uranium' (so-called because of its alleged contribution to low-carbon generation but also because the impacts of its extraction are to be 'offset'), ii) biodiversity offsets (in which environmental harm arising from development in one location is offset by conservation activity elsewhere), iii) natural products derived from indigenous plant knowledge, iv) animal hunting trophies, and v) KhoeSan rock art heritage. 

This research will enhance humanities understandings of how new 'green' objects act, and are perceived to act, to 'perform sustainability', and thereby to transfer past social and environmental health forwards into the future. We will complement this by in-depth analysis of perceptions regarding environmental change, assisted by the collation and exhibiting of repeat landscape photographs. In these, contemporary photographs reveal how landscapes have changed (or not) since early archival images, dating back to the late 1800s, were made. 

A key and iterative component of our project is the exhibiting of images, audio and video material from our research, both at the Museum in Windhoek and as mobile exhibitions in varied field contexts within Namibia. We intend this to stimulate open discussion regarding ideas of environmental change and sustainable futures, and thereby generate further research data. We will also foster public engagement through a project website with the URL www.futurepasts.net.

Results from these interconnected research strands will be synthesised and theorised in a further strand. This will examine the philosophical and ethical issues arising at the interfaces between different culturally-bound understandings of human/nature relations. Our work here will flesh-out a new cross-disciplinary domain of 'ecocultural ethics' that considers sustainability imaginaries as entwined with the cultural production of particular pasts, presents and futures. This juxtaposition of competing ethical principles underlying different sustainability perspectives will draw together the empirical material analysed in the rest of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our project engages with diverse peoples with a range of interests in environmental change and sustainability in the geographical landscape of our research (western Namibia). They include local people (primarily Damara and Herero), NGOs (in environmental conservation and tourism), business leaders (in natural products industries, tourism lodge management, trophy hunting enterprises, and uranium mining), and Namibian representatives on national and international environmental policy bodies (such as the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme). We already have connections with a range of these actors, locations and organisations, which we will foster through this research. 
 
As such, our research will be relevant for a range of potential beneficiaries with interests in projections of environmental change, perceptions regarding culture/nature relationships, and the ways these inform environmental understanding and sustainability policy solutions. 

The project is designed to facilitate and emphasise public engagement activities in Namibia at specific moments during the research (see Work Package 5). These will enhance possibilities for both the sharing of our research material and the co-production of knowledge with diverse actors, as delineated above. Our public engagement activities and events will take place in a range of contexts. They will combine exhibitions both housed by the National Museum of Namibia in Windhoek, with travelling presentations that can take place in the specific sites of our research, including in local communities and at business operations such as mines and tourism sites. 

We will also create a public project website, incorporating popular social media such as Facebook and Twitter. These online media are used in Namibia as elsewhere, and will enable interested parties, including non-academic users, to learn of and engage with our research. This will facilitate the creation of an online social network with interests in our research foci. Material published and made available online will be subject to ethical consideration, in accordance with our ethical policy. 

Through these activities we intend to generate and reach a broad and expanding range of users of, and beneficiaries from, our research (see Pathways to Impact statement). We envisage that non-academic users of the research will derive benefits in the following ways: 

- Exposure to a diversity of views and perspectives regarding environmental change and sustainability possibilities will foster greater understanding regarding the contemporary environmental moment and the concerns and desires of different groups of people.

- Public exhibitions and events in varied Namibian contexts that are designed to foster creative sharing and community memory regarding environmental change and sustainability trajectories, will enhance community and public knowledge regarding diverse perspectives on environmental issues.

- The creative and cultural industries in Namibia, via our collaborations with the National Museum of Namibia and with Mamokobo Film and Production, will benefit from the generation of content for public exhibitions and presentation events.

- Environmental policy-makers in all sectors will benefit from enhanced engagement and information regarding public understanding of environmental change and sustainability trajectories. All members of the research team already contribute to public policy development and debate (see CVs) and we will extend such activities through the proposed research. 

Our public engagement activities will be accompanied by regular possibilities for feedback and evaluation by participants so as to facilitate the assessment and reporting of impacts. This will also permit us make improvements to our public engagement activities as the project progresses.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>766260</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Partnered with BBC radio presenter, Robin Denselow to produce programme on the 2016 Damara King's Festival (Okombahe, Namibia 2016) for Radio 3 &amp;quot;World on Three&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>5B8E7918-F65F-4A46-9E62-9B4EA9E9C09A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The programme was the first-ever documentation of the annual Damara King's festival, and will be rebroadcast in Namibia in the forthcoming year.

We have established:

1. a public-facing project website at www.futurepasts.net presenting full details of our research and outputs. At our website we publicly introduce our project, share outputs and findings - including via our newly established working paper series (see below) - and have also begun a blog with five posts to date (at https://www.futurepasts.net/blog). Our online presence is complemented on social media by a twitter account @Future_Pasts and a project facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/futurepastsAHRC/. Through a Future Pasts vimeo account (https://vimeo.com/futurepasts) and a Future Pasts soundcloud account (https://soundcloud.com/futurepasts) we are additionally sharing video and audio material deriving from our research. 

2. a Future Pasts Working Papers series, as a means of sharing work in progress, as well as creating an outlet for research by Future Pasts associates. Our first four working papers are available to download in March 2016 at https://www.futurepasts.net/future-pasts-working-papers with more in preparation for publication in 2017. 

We have also begun work on a series of accessible booklets called Future Pasts Local. These are arising as outcomes of collaborations with local people and organisations and will be available to download from our website, as well as in printed form in Namibia. We have begun work with Mamokobo Film and Research (Namibia) on a series of film collaborations, including a short film generated from local storytelling events regarding environmental perceptions and relationships (facilitated by Low) and film material from the Damara King's Festival (facilitated by Impey). 

Other beyond-academia contributions include contributing to the development of a retrospective exhibition of photographic material in Windhoek as well as supplying landscape images to support various events (Rohde, see 'engagement activities' for more information). Sullivan has contributed information on specific harvesting practices in the northern part of our study area for the indigenous and endemic !nara plant (Acanthiosicyos horridus) for a policy-oriented publication on natural products of Namibia (The Commercialisation of Indigenous Natural Plant Products in Namibia, 2014). Impey is working on the repatriation of archived recordings, particularly through acquisition of prior recorded material associated with our field research areas (currently being digitised as part of the British Library's Sound Archives - World and Traditional Music - Africa collections, collection no. C1709). Impey also supported BBC Radio presenter Robin Denselow in the making of two radio programmes concerned with the Damara King's Festival, broadcast on Radio 3 and Radio 4 in late 2016 and early 2017 respectively. 

We have also shared perspectives and material from Future Pasts through various beyond-academia speaking engagements. For example, in November 2015 Hannis was an invited member of a high-level panel debating the ethics of Natural Capital approaches at the World Forum on Natural Capital in Edinburgh (www.naturalcapitalforum.com); in May 2016 Sullivan and Hannis were invited participants at the public Earthwatch debate at the Royal Geographical Society (http://eu.earthwatch.org/events/2016/02/09/earthwatch-debate-does-nature-come-with-a-price-tag-); and in June 2016 Hannis was invited by the Swedish National Council for Nuclear Waste to address an international audience of policy-makers and practitioners at a seminar entitled Ethical Perspectives on the Nuclear Fuel Cycle (http://www.karnavfallsradet.se/en/seminars/seminars).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C1B1C27C-798B-4C84-ABB7-617074274D7A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The five-year AHRC Care for the Future (Environmental Change and Sustainability) project 'Future Pasts' is a fieldwork, as well as theoretically, intensive research project. Future Pasts started in October 2013, and draws on the context of the globalised African landscape of west Namibia in a cross- and trans-disciplinary exploration of perceptions and approaches to sustainability. We are now in the fourth year our project. By way of achievements to date, we have:

* conducted a total of 18 months' field research in Namibia (Sullivan 9 months; Hannis 2 months; Impey 3,5 months; Low 2 months; Rohde 2,5 months);

* brought to completion 23 academic publications, with others in press and at varying stages of preparation;

* given 15 invited keynotes or plenaries; 

* shared Future Pasts research through 44 public engagements, including establishing a project website at www.futurepasts.net with a blog at https://www.futurepasts.net/blog, a twitter account @Future_Pasts, a project facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/futurepastsAHRC/, a Future Pasts vimeo account (https://vimeo.com/futurepasts) and a Future Pasts soundcloud account (https://soundcloud.com/futurepasts) for sharing video and audio material deriving from our research; 

* established a Future Pasts Working Papers series, with our first four working papers available to download at https://www.futurepasts.net/future-pasts-working-papers and several more papers in preparation for publication in 2017;

* begun work on a series of accessible booklets called Future Pasts Local which will be available to download from our website, and in printed form in Namibia;

* begun work with Mamokobo Film and Research (Namibia) on a series of film collaborations, available at our Future Pasts vimeo site at https://vimeo.com/futurepasts; 

* developed 13 collaborations and partnerships, with primarily Namibian organisations; 

* held four project meetings;

* booked our first project exhibition, to be held in Bath in July-August 2017 and incorporating images by photographer Sylvia Diez, seconded to Future Pasts during field research in March 2016.
 

Our project is organised to respond to four core research questions, namely:

Q1. How are 'the past' and constructions of 'pastness' being fashioned into new green materialities that act to perform 'green economy' responses to ecological crisis?

Q2. How do these new green materialities intersect with differing cultural conceptions of environmental change and sustainability?

Q3. How can archival and repeat landscape photographs anchor understandings of environmental change, constructions of environmental pasts, and visionings of environmental futures?

Q4. What normative assumptions underpin contemporary sustainability technologies and innovations, and what are the philosophical implications of juxtaposing these with other(ed) 'ecocultural' ethical frameworks?

Below we provide detail regarding our progress to date in responding to these key questions, as well as developments in our research and key associated outputs. A fully referenced and fleshed out conceptual framework for our research is available in our first Future Pasts Working Paper ('Future Pasts? Sustainabilities in west Namibia - a conceptual framework for research', Sullivan, Hannis, Impey, Low, Rohde, online at https://www.futurepasts.net/fpwp1-sullivan-et-al-2016). 


RESEARCH AND FINDINGS IN RELATION TO OUR FOUR CORE RESEARCH QUESTIONS:

Q1. How are 'the past' and constructions of 'pastness' being fashioned into new green materialities that act to perform 'green economy' responses to ecological crisis?

Enduring fear that the landscape of west Namibia is on the brink of ecological collapse and catastrophe - associated with 'desertification', climate change, species loss and industrial development - creates specific apocalyptic frames that invite innovative sustainability interventions. The landscape of west Namibia is entwined with a key international concern to generate a global 'green economy' that seeks to produce both economic growth and environmental sustainability. The specific combination of ways in which this is unfolding in the geographical context of west Namibia provides a rich setting for exploring in detail the productions of 'green economy' discourses, policies and interventions (Sullivan, Hannis, Impey, Low and Rohde 2016; 2016; Sullivan 2017a and b). Key dimensions include drawing into the open the versions of past relationships between people, landscapes, and associated organic and inorganic entities on which these interventions are built, as well as elucidating the versions of future relationships that interventions seek to amplify. Simultaneously, the sometimes rather 'other' understandings of 'sustainability' and culturenature relationships embodied in what is becoming known as the intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of some of the region's variously indigenous inhabitants can be brought further into dialogue with these interventions. 

Opening up the circumstances through which particular green economy and sustainability proposals (have) become uttered and established, can thereby deepen understandings of the historicity - the actuality of contexts and events, as well as their inclusions and exclusions - structuring the unfolding of conditions in the present and into the future. In this dimension of Future Pasts research, then, we are interested in exploring how exactly environmental 'sustainability' is understood to be generated through the production and circulation of particular commodities produced in west Namibia and asserted to be 'green'. Relevant sources of information include discourse analysis of policy and other texts, interviews with key actors, and participant observation. Through this, we clarify and juxtapose proposals by different actors associated with the west Namibia landscape for generating 'sustainability' into the future. Completed and in process elements of research include: 

i. Ethnographic engagement with the unfolding of Community-Based Natural Resources Management as a powerful instrument of market-based 'improvement' in environmental and economic spheres, highlights historically and culturally embedded appropriations, frictions and resistances (Sullivan 2016a, 2017a, in prep. a). Local desire for land and natural resources is set within a complex history of eviction of peoples from ancestral homes in the course of mapping and manufacturing areas of the west Namibian landscape as a 'world-class pristine, unspoilt wilderness'. Memories of peoples' different relationships with landscapes prior to eviction linger and thus haunt the present, constituting a basis for on-site oral history research through journeys to places formerly experienced and remembered as homes by elders now living on the periphery of tourism concessions and conservation areas. A range of Future Pasts publications are currently emerging that explore the emotional geographies of such former dwelling places and the broader cultural landscape, and their continuing resonances for people in the present (Sullivan and Hannis 2016; Sullivan 2016a; Rohde and Sullivan in prep.; Ganuses and Sullivan in prep.; Sullivan, Ganuses, Sanib, |Awises, ||Ho&amp;euml;b, Ganaseb, |Nuab, |Awarab in prep). This is set within a time-depth of historical record going back several hundred years that traces the enrolment of this landscape and peoples into global networks of trade, commerce and eventually colonial administration (Sullivan in prep. b and c). 

ii. In this context of a general marketisation of biodiversity conservation, the commercialised hunting of selected animal wildlife species and individuals is promoted as one route towards conserving regional populations of wild animal species, at the same time as contributing to economic growth. Hunted trophies - parts of animals (heads, skins, horns, ivory, bodies) that become tangible reminders of a hunted charismatic animal - constitute paradoxical sustainability objects. Viewed and promoted as supporting biodiversity conservation through the controversial killing of individuals of valued species, they effectively signal a radically consequentialist ethic of 'killing for conservation' (theorised in Hannis 2016), often in tension with socio-cultural dimensions of local and indigenous values regarding fauna in the area (Sullivan and Hannis 2016; Hannis and Sullivan in press). 

iii. Indigenous plant species and associated regional ethnobotanical knowledge and ICH have also been developed and commercialised into exported natural products linked discursively with enhancements of the economic value of local biodiversity, and a fostering of 'economic development' through associated income generation. We have begun to connect these processes with alternative cultural histories of connection and association with selected plant species, particularly the endemic cucurbit and food plant Acanthosicyos horridus or !nara, through a collaborative project conducted with researchers associated with the Namibian Gobabeb Research and Training Centre. '!Nara harvesters of the northern Namib' (Sullivan, Ganuses, ||Ho&amp;euml;b, Ganaseb, N., Tauros, Ganaseb, M., |Nuas and |Nuab in prep.) thus reinscribes the environmental histories and cultural landscapes of inhabitants of the northern Namib in a context of historical and contemporary marginalisation of these histories, as well as historicising the circumstances leading to an entrenching of particular histories of association and development regarding this species. 

iv. Access to the wealth of rock art heritage and other cultural monuments in the region is similarly commercialised so as to foster conservation through enhancing the market value of indigenous cultural heritage. The west Namibia landscape is replete with rock art objects and places, and access to this art is marketed in terms of supporting future preservation through heritage and cultural tourism. This involves commodifications and repackagings of KhoeSan rock art heritage in productive ways that can be in tension with the subtle cultural ontologies of extant peoples whose contemporary lifeworlds may provide windows into the thinking informing production of the art (Sullivan and Low 2014; also Low 2017 on San healing practices specifically). We are engaging further with the presentations and interpretations of rock art informing this commercialisation, at the same time as considering ways through which KhoeSan peoples may be essentialised in combination with the use of rock art images in promotional material, and/or through their display in 'San villages' and 'Living Museums' associated with commercial wildlife reserves and lodges (explored in Sullivan in prep. d). 

v. Beyond the tourism and heritage related commodifications described above, are moves to wrap significant regional economic developments in innovative sustainability policies. A proliferation of uranium mining activities in west Namibia thus claims to contribute to environmental sustainability, in part through celebrations of uranium as fuelling low-carbon energy production globally, as well as by its proposed use of 'biodiversity offsetting'. Through discourse analysis of the emergence of influential biodiversity offsetting policy in northern contexts, Sullivan and Hannis (2015) find that optimistic claims that the desired objective of 'no net loss' of 'biodiversity' can be achieved through offsetting risk occluding possibly intractable 'value struggles' between groups embracing and contesting this new conservation technology (discussed further in Sullivan 2017a and Sullivan and Hannis submitted).

We draw theoretically on new humanities discussions of 'materiality', 'value', speech act theory and performativity to consider the performative implications of these new 'green' materialities. We suggest that the mineral, biological and heritage assemblages outlined above are being mobilised in accordance with linear temporal dynamics and dominant sustainability imaginaries that may be unpredictably 'destabilised' through both the 'liveliness' of the 'actants' of which they are constituted, and the contextual frictions within which they are being developed. In particular, since these particular green economy performativities of necessity prefigure and/or preclude specific environmental futures, they can have significant ethical, as well as ecological, implications, leading to our second guiding research question, namely:


Q2. How do these new green materialities intersect with differing cultural conceptions of environmental change and sustainability?

As hinted at above, developmentalist green 'materialities' and 'performativities' jostle with a range of alternative understandings of environmental change and sustainability, as well as with conceptions of human endeavour that might be perceived as differently entrained and embedded with natural rhythms and cycles. Such alternative understandings can be infused by rather different conceptions of ecological and temporal dynamics, of the sources of agency (see Sullivan and Hannis 2016; Hannis and Sullivan in press), and of what practices constitute appropriate present behaviours in terms of caring for both pasts and futures. These become alterities that haunt the green economy appropriations described above. Their traces remain as 'othernesses' that embody ambiguities and pluralities of value regarding bodies, places and artefacts, as well as the flows and networked relationships between which these entities are (perceived to be) connected. 

In pursuing ethnographic research regarding the productions and performances of sustainability in west Namibia we are drawing on the opportunity for three of us (Sullivan, Rohde, Low) to revisit and interview individuals, families and communities known in west Namibia through earlier in-depth ethnographic and ethnoecological study. Through this updating of biographical information and the generation of 'written portraits' we are able to better understand sociocultural, economic and environmental changes since the early 1990s (Ganuses and Sullivan in prep.; Rohde in prep. a). Pursuing threads from previous oral history research in the area regarding peoples' pasts and particularly their past relationships with places in the broader landscape, extensive field research has now been conducted by Sullivan with a number of Khoe-speaking elders to map places and cultural histories that have been erased from official discourses regarding land where they used to live (Sullivan 2016a, 2017a and b). Through visiting former dwelling sites in this landscape with people who remember living there, memories are triggered, both of past ways of living and the associated autonomous enacting of shared values, and of direct experiences of past injustice through which people were constrained to leave places they considered to be home (Sullivan 2016a; Sullivan and Hannis 2016; Sullivan in prep. c, e; Ganuses and Sullivan in prep.; Sullivan, Ganuses, ||Ho&amp;euml;b, Ganaseb, N., Tauros, Ganaseb, M., |Nuas and |Nuab in prep.; Sullivan, Ganuses, Sanib, |Awises, ||Ho&amp;euml;b, Ganaseb, |Nuab, |Awarab in prep.). 

This on-site oral history and journeying methodology has enabled participation in relevant practices as well as ongoing conversations regarding peoples' histories of association with places, their past movements through landscapes, their remembered experiences of living there and of the pressures that required them to leave. A few such experiences and associated temporalities will be mentioned here. The first is the practice of 'tse-khom', which involves talking to ancestors, in this case those buried at and associated with numerous places throughout the Palmwag tourism concession and beyond. 'Tse-khom' introduces travellers to the ancestors - or 'kai khoen', i.e. 'big or old people' as they are known. In 'tse-khom' ancestral agencies are requested to act in the present to open the road so that travellers can see the best way to go. They are asked to mediate the activities of potentially dangerous animals such as lions, who are viewed very much as other ensouled beings who assert their own agencies and intentionality. They are asked for guidance regarding the most appropriate ways to do things, practices that have eco-ethical effects. In 'tse-khom', the ancestors are souls whose ontological reality means that they can assert various kinds of agency in the present, sometimes over other kinds of agency, such as that of animals (for more detail see Sullivan 2016a, 2017a; Sullivan and Hannis 2016).

Sometimes, 'tse-khom' includes mention of a key ancestor hero known in this area as Haiseb, who features in broader KhoeSan folklore as Haitsi-Aibeb. The Haitsi-Aibeb/Haiseb cluster of stories and practices are inscribed on the landscape through large cairns found throughout the drylands of south-west Africa, from the Cape in the south to Kunene Region in the north. Haiseb/Haitsi-Aibeb cairns have featured in colonial records since the 1650s, interpreted, probably erroneously, as symbolically marking the graves of an always resurrecting Haitsi-Aibeb. As part of our intention to trace and theorise particular amodern conceptions and experiences of the west Namibia landscape we are currently triangulating several sources of information - mapped and recorded encounters with cairns, colonial records, national monuments listings, databases of cairn sites, and ethnographic encounters with local people - to better understand the Haiseb cairns and their meanings, both past and present. We have mapped and photographed Haiseb cairns in the west Namibian landscape, and recorded and transcribed a number of stories and songs documenting Haiseb's antics and associated storytelling practices (Low and Sullivan in prep.). Haiseb and other key ?Nukhoen motifs are also a key focus of filmed story-telling events facilitated by Low in collaboration with one of our Namibian partners, Mamokobo Film and Research (see the Future Pasts film 'Haiseb in the landscape' at https://vimeo.com/202618340). 

An additional focus here is consideration of creative encodings of land, the elements, and specific other-than-human-natures in the contemporary sounds (songs), gestures (dances/embodiment) and poetic recitations (stories), through which relationships with places, landscapes and specific entities and events therein may be expressed using particular symbolic and/or metaphorical registers (Sullivan in prep. e). We also ask how changes in expressive traditions may have occurred over time and places. One way through which this is being pursued is through recent articulations of Namibian cultural identities and histories through public spectacles, such as the annual Damara King's Festival (Impey in prep. a, and filmed material at https://vimeo.com/futurepasts). This event offers significant insight into contemporary articulations of past values, and to medicinal and spiritual dimensions of the environment in particular. The collective effervescence of such socially structured spectacles, invoked in particular through songs, ritual performances and public oratory, tends to override everyday resistances demonstrated toward the 'old ways', particularly if the latter are understood to conflict with the teachings of the church. Detailed audio and video documentation of festival activities provide invaluable resources for both feedback analysis, helping to build narratives about the meanings of sounds, gestures and symbolic interactions, and to build the archive, which to date, remains relatively small. 

A second way in which changes through time in expressive traditions is being explored is through engagement with records and recordings housed in a variety of archives (especially the National Archives of Namibia and the Resource Centre of the Basler Afrika Bibliographien), and recordings by Future Pasts researchers in the course of past ethnographic engagements in the area. Of particular note is our access to the entire collection of master recordings of Namibian music made in the 1990s and early 2000s by French ethnomusicologist, Emmanuelle Olivier. Through Future Pasts this archive of more than 100 DAT tapes plus images and metadata has been collected from France by Impey, and deposited for digitisation in the British Library Sound Archives, where it will be available as part of the World and Traditional Music - Africa collections (collection no. C1709). Following this digitisation process, recordings will be repatriated to appropriate Namibian contexts, as well as being mobilised as memory prompts in current research. We seek in particular to explore the mnemonic potential of this archive of historical and contemporary song and dance material for the recovery of oral narratives concerning socioecological health, the dynamics of change, and the historical relationships that individuals and groups may have had with different times and places (Impey in prep. b). 


Q3. How can archival and repeat landscape photographs anchor understandings of environmental change, constructions of environmental pasts, and visionings of environmental futures?

As noted above, narratives of impending ecological crisis are prominent in environmental discourse in Namibia. Future scenarios based on climate models have predicted increasing aridity and drought, leading to degradation, loss of productivity and biodiversity declines. In general, this 'future catastrophe anxiety' posits an expansion of desert and arid shrubs into present grassland savannas and a reduction in net primary productivity and economic potential. In Future Pasts we are opening up and complementing such narratives through a unique opportunity to mobilise and extend a large dataset of repeat landscape images for west Namibia gathered by one of us (Rohde), dating back to the late 1800s. These images form the basis for analysis of the historical ecology of the arid and semi-arid areas of west Namibia using a repeat landscape photography and comparative survey methodology developed over the last two decades by Rohde (Rohde in prep. b). 

Bringing together archival landscape photographs from the past, with repeat photographs of these same scenes in the present, can provide surprising empirical (re)assessments of the materialities of environmental change. One hundred and three repeat landscape photograph sites have now been identified and surveyed across the broader Namib and pro-Namib landscapes. These sites extend 160 km inland from the coast and cover three degrees of latitude (330km). The average time-lapse between the date of the original image and the repeat is eighty years and every decade between 1870 and 1990 is represented in this collection. 

Presently Rohde is collaborating with academics at the University of Cape Town, including Timm Hoffman and Sam Jack from the Department of Biological Sciences and Ian Durbach from the Department of Statistical Sciences in order to establish the complex analysis of the relationships between variables such as vegetation type, growth form, percentage change per annum, distance from coast, altitude and climatic averages (e.g. precipitation, fog days, temperature, insolation etc.). Vegetation change is used here as a proxy for climate change since very few long-term climate records exist from which to establish climatic trends. Preliminary assessments of the vegetation surveyed at these repeat photo sites indicates a steady increase in woody vegetation across almost all habitat types, even in the coastal desert plains. 

A specific Future Pasts collaboration arising from this thread of our research is with the FogLife research programme, a long-term monitoring initiative established recently by one of our Namibian partner organisations - Gobabeb Research and Training Centre - to explore how fog-dependent species of the Namib Desert are responding to global environmental change. Over half of all the repeat photograph sites are situated within the Namib fog zone (up to 75km from the coast). Changes to fog dependent vegetation in this area is directly correlated with changes in fog frequency and density. Fog, in turn is correlated to sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of the cold eastern boundary upwelling system of the Benguela Current. Hence, the results of our analysis within the fogbelt will reveal recent (&amp;lt; 100 years) trends of change related to e.g. the southeast Atlantic high pressure zone, tropical temperate troughs and regional atmospheric circulation patterns generally.

Similarly, changes in vegetation species composition and percentage cover in the more easterly areas (between 76km and 150km from the coast) are directly correlated to annual average rainfall patterns. Preliminary evidence here suggests that trends in regional synoptic conditions have resulted in increasing rainfall in the eastern Namib possibly related to Benguela La Nina events. While the causal factors associated with increase fog and increased rainfall seem at first to be contradictory, it is possible that oscillating pulses in the warming and cooling of SSTs in the Benguela provide a plausible explanation, although these hypothetical correlations should become more clearly defined with further analysis.

The ephemeral rivers are very dynamic although the repeat photos from these riverine sites show an interesting divergence between the Kuiseb and Swakop rivers in relation to change: the Kuiseb is highly disturbed showing rapid turn-over of phreatic vegetation (i.e. vegetation influenced by availability of underground water sources), whereas the Swakop is much more stable and shows less overall cover in the main channels. This is possibly related to the upstream damming of the Swakop, affecting the magnitude of flood events and alluvial aquifer recharge. 

In developing and expanding our research regarding historical ecologies of the Namib and perceptions of environment change we have opened up an additional research thread involving assessments of the specific role that a single species - Aloe dichotoma - is playing in the generation of understandings of climate change in west Namibia. Regarding the latter, and as Rohde and colleagues are arguing, repeat photographs can be used to illuminate the dynamics of specific Aloe dichotoma populations stretching northwards from the Cape to the Brandberg in west Namibia, and are requiring a radical rethink of received wisdoms regarding climate change understandings in southern Africa (Jack, Hoffman, Rohde, Durbach and Archibald 2014; Jack, Hoffman, Rohde and Durbach 2016). This species is often cited as an example of poleward species migration in response to anthropogenic warming. Furthermore, supposed harsher conditions in the equatorward populations (between Keetmanshoop and Brandberg) are leading to die-offs in this long-lived tree aloe. In particular, Rohde and colleagues find that there is no evidence that the effects of global warming are evident in the demographic patterns of this species and that previous studies do not take account of the phenotypic plasticity of this species in response to the two different climate regimes that occupy their range across 10 degrees of latitude: stochastic precipitation conditions in the northern summer rainfall zone/ reliable and more plentiful winter rainfall in the south. These more arid conditions in the north result in much longer intervals between recruitment events than in the south. Given that A. dichotoma live for up to 300 years, recruitment of new individuals need only take place once or twice a century in order that the population persists. This fact accounts for the different population dynamics that have previously been wrongly interpreted as recent evidence of anthropogenic climate change. 

Finally, these empirical findings will provide comparative counter-balance to the downscaled global circulation models that posit present and future trends of change. As such, Future Pasts historical ecology research forms one of the few studies in Namibia based on historical evidence in relation to anthropogenic global warming. 


Q4. What normative assumptions underpin contemporary sustainability technologies and innovations, and what are the philosophical implications of juxtaposing these with other(ed) 'ecocultural' ethical frameworks?

As can be seen, Future Pasts is pursuing multiple lines of enquiry to explore, interrogate and become resonant with different understandings and embodiments of sustainability and environmental change, both within the specific geographical and temporal contexts of our field research and at a more conceptual level. Given our various disciplines, approaches and influences, bringing together the different elements of our project to create analytical and theoretical coherence is potentially challenging. One key way we seek to meet this challenge is by drawing on approaches in environmental ethics and moral philosophy to flesh out and theorise what we are calling 'ecocultural ethics', an ethical approach that foregrounds cultural variability in ethical assumptions regarding human relationships with natures-beyond-the-human. We see this as a cross-disciplinary domain that more explicitly theorises sustainability imaginaries as entwined with the cultural production of particular pasts, presents and futures. We are using the term 'ecocultural ethics' because we are interested in the ethical assumptions that underlie different culturally-inflected perspectives regarding both beyond-human-natures, and ways of knowing these natures. 

In this component of our research we are conducting theoretical and interpretive work that combines elements of the empirical and textual material generated in pursuit of our other research objectives with established theoretical frameworks in environmental philosophy, including ethical theory (descriptive and normative), concepts of sustainability and substitutability, and imaginaries of past, present and future human/nature relationships. Through this research thread, then, we conduct a more formal philosophical enquiry into the ethical assumptions and framings underlying contemporary 'green economy' policies and practices, in juxtaposition with those that might be seen to be embodied in the knowledges and practices highlighted in other components of our research. Synthesising relevant insights from capabilities, rights and virtue ethics approaches in particular, we explore ecocultural differences regarding underlying assumptions and judgements about what kinds of relationships between humans and 'the rest of the world' are required for flourishing human lives, and therefore considered sufficiently valuable to be deliberately protected and facilitated for future generations. Our research to date queries the apparent hegemony of utilitarian approaches in 'green economy' and 'natural capital' orientations to environmental decision-making (Sullivan and Hannis 2015; Sullivan 2016a, 2017a and b), asking why calculative approaches are apparently considered less problematic in this context than in others such as medical ethics (Hannis 2016). It has also examined tensions between 'sustainability' understood as the continued possibility of flourishing lives, and understood (as in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development) as the maintenance of particular development trajectories and resource inventories (Hannis, in press). We instead propose linking human and nonhuman flourishing by way of a eudaimonist environmental virtue ethics (Hannis 2015, 2016), and find that there are overlaps between this kind of approach and the ways in which local stories and practices may connect the flourishing of human and nonhuman agencies (Sullivan and Hannis 2016; Hannis and Sullivan in press). We also bring ethical approaches from moral philosophy into conversation with a range of terms mobilised in anthropological and cultural geography, and have to this end been pursuing ethnographical and theoretical work to explore and connect concepts of ontology, affect, mimesis, embodiment and alterity (see Sullivan 2016a, b, c, d).
