&lt;p>The project aims to determine if general principles of water allocation and equity can be identified, and what the scope is for transferring them across contexts. It involves comparative research in Bangladesh, Tanzania and Malawi. Key questions include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;What are the ?local rules? for governing access to water and what shapes these?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;What is the relationship between ?local? rules and ?outside? influences such as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; government, business and NGO initiatives?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How are the politics of water control changing?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The Principal Investigator of the project is Dr Elizabeth Harrison in the Anthropology Department at the University of Sussex. Prof Dominic Kniveton (Geography Department) is Co-Investigator and Dr Canford Chiroro is full time postdoctoral research fellow. Research partners in the three field sites are based at Mzumbe University, Tanzania, Jahangirnagar University, Bangladesh and Bunda College of Agriculture, Malawi.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The results of the proposed research will potentially benefit many people, both within academia and outside it, but perhaps no one more than policy-makers who are concerned with economic growth. It will be of special interest to others having a particular interest in the contribution that irrigation-and irrigation improvement-can potentially make to that process. 

The results of the research, including profiles of the irrigation systems and a discussion of the other economic innovations mentioned in the Case for Support, will be presented in the following outputs, which will be disseminated as widely and rapidly as possible through several channels:
 
1. preliminary and final reports on each of the three cases studied, as required by the ESRC and DfID;
2. one version of the students' individual case studies, each of which will be turned into an article for publication, hopefully in a special issue of a major scholarly journal.
2. a second version to take the form of a chapter for an edited book volume presenting all of the project's final results (to be edited by the PI), which may be prepared during the last year of the research (assuming that a publishing contract can be arranged);
3. papers to be given by each member of the field research team (including the PI) at annual professional meetings and other academic forums;
4. ethnographic profiles of the three studied communities, to be presented on the project web page;
5. presentations given by members of the research team at a one-day conference, at Cranfield University, where the results of the research will be disseminated publicly. 

Two principal channels will be used to ensure that most of these outputs are disseminated rapidly, and have the broadest possible impact, among agencies and NGO's working in the irrigation sector, both in the UK and abroad. The first will be an informal electronic collaboration with four key global organizations which have expressed interest in the project: the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka (IWMI), the FAO in Rome, the International Conference on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) in the UK, and the International Network on Participatory Irrigation Management (INPIM), now headquartered in Pakistan. As soon as the project reports become available, they will be posted on the project web page and sent electronically to these organizations (with the ESRC's permission), for dissemination as working papers to their regional offices, and to their staff and to their wider membership, including participating NGO's. These will essentially be offered as a form of common intellectual property, for general use in development. Other opportunities to do the same with other organizations will be taken advantage of as they become available, such as the International Human Dimensions Programme (IHDP). Seminar presentations will hopefully also be made at DfID and ESRC-sponsored events in the UK, or perhaps at the Overseas Development Institute. 

The second channel will be a one-day Dissemination Workshop, to be held at Cranfield University toward the end of the last year of the project. A senior delegate of the main irrigation development agency of each of the three countries included in the study-Tanzania, Malawi and Bangladesh--will be invited, probably a person from that country's embassy in each case, along with 3 irrigation experts from major research institutions in the UK. This event, along with the other outputs and activities described above, should ensure that the results of the project are disseminated as widely as possible, and that the research has the broadest possible impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>231366</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Tanzania, United Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Partnership with Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania</gtr:description><gtr:id>4F1B1DE7-C4F3-4FE4-9CA1-BA0CE3802B33</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs as yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Facilitation of dialogue between different stakeholders</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Anna Mdee is working with Sustainable Agriculture Tanzania, based in Morogoro, to incorporate the findings of the research into a multi-stakeholder project that attempts to address the resource conflicts identified by our research.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meeting with CISANET, Malawi</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D6B886F4-C8B9-4DF1-B4E9-D07412A98AF3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a briefing meeting with members of the key coordinating body of agricultural development organisations in Malawi, drawing on a range of practitioners. CISANET is also playing a role in the new Shire Valley Irrigation Project and has stated that findings will be important in relation to this. Among the observations about the research, the following were identified by participants as of particular interest:
1. Ethnographic and long term studies are not commonly undertaken by local Malawian researchers, and as such most reports generated do not give the depth of analysis as provided in the Project report. The approach to data collection and analysis was seen as robust, and providing a fresh perspective to understanding issues and their implications for agriculture. The study's analysis was helpful for understanding otherwise overlooked areas which, apparently, are key to transforming agriculture.
2. The implications of climate change have received less attention in policy, and this study makes a strong case for the consideration for adapting irrigation to climate change. This will be noted and contextualised in future planning. 
3. The case studies provided a rich insight into issues at the local level, including the effect of policies on households and irrigation schemes, e.g. land and water rights and the issue of access for people not directly linked to the irrigation schemes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Production of briefing notes for engagement meetings, also posted online</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B4A8704-7451-4B6C-92D0-EA9EFD14CBC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Briefing letter only just published online, so unlikely to have generated results yet.

The invited audience included technical professionals in government ministries, researchers, farmer organizations, NGOs, donor agencies, and the private sector working on irrigation and water management in Tanzania.
The objectives of the workshop were to:
Review recent trends and goals for irrigation development in Tanzania.
ii. Examine alternative paths for irrigation investment by government and private
sector, including smallholder producers, and their potential for further development.
o Research findings on public-private partnerships (PPPs) and small-scale
irrigation development, and remaining information gaps and data issues.
iii. Identify social and economic impacts of irrigation development in rural communities
o Methodologies to assess how different paths for irrigation development generate opportunities and constraints for rural people to benefit from irrigation, and
o How these differ for different social groups (men, women, youth). iv. Explore the role of irrigation policy in fostering PPP.
o What models do we have for supporting, regulating and investing in irrigation?
o What policy alternatives need to be considered to respond to different irrigation scenarios?

The expected outputs were:

? Identification of key policy areas, appropriate PPP models, and action needed to develop or implement them
? Identification of possible input from research and development partners to support these actions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meetings with Scheme Committees and farmers</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1298DF1-4B20-4A9E-9C0F-9381D2647D3F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Some of the issues were identified as important and will be the subject of forthcoming planning and management meetings.

Knowledge, innovation and moral economies. One of the central questions that this project set out to answer was whether, in contexts within which irrigation has been well established, there are specific elements of the moral economy that could be replicated in contexts in which it is newer. Can the 'soft technology' of resource management be 'transferred'? Our answer to this question is 'probably not', as the evidence from the study shows that increasing pressure on water resources has resulted in institutional pluralism where interests and power at different scales can subvert any benefits of a 'local' moral economy. Even at the local level, conflict and contestation over resources, particularly land and water, would possibly even make such an attempt at transfer ethically problematic. 

Nonetheless, there is considerable appetite and ability to learn about 'hard technology' across contexts and farmers will adapt these to their own realities. However new knowledge and innovations are not universally welcomed. An example from Malawi shows that new ideas about small-scale irrigation tend to be resisted when 'lead farmer' models of knowledge transfer are embarked upon.

2. Formal and informal institutions. The formalisation of existing irrigation practices at a local level has several drawbacks with regard to equity and poverty: it often results in the 'capture' of institutions and resources by those already in a position of strength; and generally fails to take into the broader hydro-politics within which this access is embedded. Institutionally, the bodies that are charged with promoting and developing irrigation tend to be insufficiently integrated to the broader national political context for managing agriculture and natural resources. This contributes to difficulties in managing scarce resources such as water, particularly across administrative boundaries. At present there is insufficient attention to these challenges in each of our research sites.

The model of promoting irrigation in smallholder 'schemes' remains popular. These have historically suffered from management problems and this is a problem that persists. The problem reflects a seldom-discussed paradox: that, usually surrounded by a catchment of settlements, such schemes serve farmers who, together, do not constitute a 'community'. The concept of a community of small irrigators is problematic where those involved have connections within and outside of those involved in small-scale irrigation. They also have diverse other calls on their time and energy, including in their dry-land farming.

3. Resilience, poverty, livelihoods and growth. Small-scale irrigation can and does contribute to improved livelihoods for many irrigating farmers. They continue with it because it makes economic sense to them. However, it does not necessarily contribute to broader economic growth objectives as such benefits are not captured in national reporting data. At the same time, support to irrigation can contribute to increased resilience for those who benefit from such support. However, it is vitally important to consider the extent to which such increased resilience for some comes at the cost of increased vulnerability for others. In Malawi, we found strong evidence for this taking place and are engaging with policy makers regarding the possibility of this being reinforced in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The initial proposal contained pathways to impact that were not appropriate to the revised project objectives. Our findings suggest the following pathways to impact.

1. In November 2014 and May 2016, we held a series of strategic meetings and presentations in Malawi, from international through to local levels. Key forums for this include CISANET, an umbrella organisation of NGOs and donors working in the sector; regular meetings of significant donors to the sector, including the World Bank and African Development Bank and through them to the major irrigation initiatives: IRLAD, SVIP and GBI; presentations to the District meeting in Nsanje District that brings together NGO, donor projects and government department; and local level meetings with farmers and the Water Users' Association.
2. In Malawi, working with our former collaborator, now an MP, in order to influence policy within the Malawi government. We have been invited to present project findings to Parliament next year.
3. Academic outputs targeted to high quality journals. To date, two articles have been published (Journal of Peasant Studies and Journal of Development Effectiveness), a further one is in press (Water Alternatives), two are under review (Journal of Modern African Studies and Journal of Political Economy) and two are drafted (for submission to World Development and Critique of Anthropology)
4. We have been communicating with relevant projects under phase two of the DEGRP, including that on 'Studying Africa Farmer-Led Irrigation'. This has included a collaborative workshop in Tanzania organised with the National Irrigation Commission. We would anticipate working closely with this project in ensuring that findings from our project are incorporated and taken forward as part of their impact activities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5B0E185A-273D-4593-AE93-2A24F67F9881</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sussex.ac.uk/global/showcase/researchprojects/small_scale_irrigation</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to participate in the National Wetland Policy dialogue</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9727499-CDA1-43D5-87ED-0179E8E96DC1</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/63701E93-D59D-473F-B23D-BB2F26C5649A"><gtr:id>63701E93-D59D-473F-B23D-BB2F26C5649A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Small scale irrigation in Noakhali Char area of Bangladesh</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e3aaa999b60bddbced175e1640a7e957"><gtr:id>e3aaa999b60bddbced175e1640a7e957</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ahmed, Z</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/92DB891C-9B22-4469-9D8C-57214A061E55"><gtr:id>92DB891C-9B22-4469-9D8C-57214A061E55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Differentiated legitimacy, differentiated resilience: beyond the natural in 'natural disasters'</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The Journal of Peasant Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dafbd4243b6ec0204937afeed7302cc3"><gtr:id>dafbd4243b6ec0204937afeed7302cc3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Harrison E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A5777806-15DB-4EF1-B96A-EC93BAEC5DE7"><gtr:id>A5777806-15DB-4EF1-B96A-EC93BAEC5DE7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dakawa rice farm -
