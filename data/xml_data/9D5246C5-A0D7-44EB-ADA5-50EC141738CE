We used recent advances in surveillance science and risk profiling to identifying land, which is more likely to contribute to agricultural pollution. Our research quantified the economic and environmental benefits of using spatially targeted regulation on high-risk land, i.e. land that is pollution prone and hydrologically connected to rivers. We investigated this by constructing large bio-physical economic models of two English river catchments (River Eden and River Wensum) and by conducting structured farm surveys. Overall, we found that a spatially micro-targeted approach reduced the cost of complying with environmental standards - thus benefiting regulators, farmers and the environment. Thus, if farmers mainly undertake pollution mitigation measures, and regulators mostly inspect practices, on targeted high-risk land, the cost of complying with water quality standards is reduced.
More specifically, the study: 
1) Quantified the cost-effectiveness of adopting spatially targeted policies to reduce diffuse pollution over a range of conventional uniform policies including cover crops, minimum tillage, land retirement and stocking density reduction; 
2) Determined the sensitivity of cost-effectiveness based policy ranking to the regulatory target, i.e. probability of compliance with water quality metric; 
3) Determined how the cost-effective ranking of policies changes in two different very different agricultural catchments. 
4) Estimated the 'transaction costs' of spatially targeted policies based on their attributes from a choice experiment surveys of 144 farmers in two catchments; 
5) Investigated the use of novel economic incentives that encourage the spatial coordination to increase farmland biodiversity between neighbouring farms; 
6) Estimated the cost-effectiveness of a tradable land retirement scheme based on hydrological connectivity and pollution risk profiling of land; 
7) Quantified agricultural multi-pollutant 'pollution swapping' under numerous simulated policies. 
Our main finding is that spatially targeted policies are generally cost-effective at reducing diffuse pollution and should be considered within the suite of regulatory control policies. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a range of spatially targeted policies from extensive applications of spatially targeted pollution mitigation measures to localised micro targeted ones. Preliminary results indicate that the improvement in cost-effectiveness over conventional uniform policies is dependent on the agricultural system, spatial characteristics of the landscape and assumed transaction costs. Transaction costs estimates vary greatly and incorporating this uncertainty in the analysis changes the absolute cost-effectiveness of policies.
We found instances of perverse or unanticipated outcomes, for example, implementing one policy to control nitrogen pollution inadvertently caused an increase in phosphorus and sediment pollution; or situations where policies aimed at reducing diffuse water pollutants actually results in sight increases in greenhouse gas emissions - largely due to reallocations of land use under uniform policies. Notably, such pollution swapping is less likely under spatially targeted policies, especially micro targeted ones.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The main beneficiaries of our interdisciplinary research are UK agri-environmental/water policy makers, regulators (DEFRA, EA, SEPA, NIEA, NRW) and a broad spectrum of environmental stakeholders (Rivers Trusts, Wildlife Trusts). This project's aim is to inform and influence diffuse water pollution regulatory policy in the UK by engaging and involving agri-environmental/water pollution regulators. Other stakeholder beneficiaries include the: RSPB, WWF, FoE, Rivers Trusts and National Farmers Union. 
We secured &amp;pound;25K of funding from Durham University's Impact Acceleration Fund to build on and significantly strengthen our outreach, collaboration and knowledge exchange with practioners and end-users. We intend to achieve this through three direct policy maker engagement activities, two large end-user/ stakeholder workshops, two formal impact surveys (quantify research benefit), circulating non-technical summaries, producing and promoting a short online video for the wider public on our well-used project website (http://www.scimap.org.uk/) over a five year period.
We linked our project with DEFRA's Demonstration Test Catchment Programme and secured further funding from DEFRA (&amp;pound;19.6K) to increase the sample size of our farm surveys. We initiated follow on research extensions with new academic collaborators that involved bring faecal indicator organisms, pesticides and pollinators into our spatially targeted risk based approach. Three new large follow on research proposals were submitted for EU Horizon 2020 and BBSRC-NERC-ESRC funding. Moreover we are currently collaborating with the British Geological Survey to consider linking a ground water model to make our research findings more useful.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FC5102C2-F107-46FA-B9CF-889DFE1E1EC5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/150088B7-58F0-4B45-BEDB-59357EDBBCB9"><gtr:id>150088B7-58F0-4B45-BEDB-59357EDBBCB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Transferability of Policies to Control Agricultural Nonpoint Pollution in Relatively Similar Catchments</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecological Economics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c02b61ccd957be1bd3e5df78087f1197"><gtr:id>c02b61ccd957be1bd3e5df78087f1197</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Aftab A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>09218009</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/I037822/1</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-062-23-3289</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
