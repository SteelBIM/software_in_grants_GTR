It has recently been shown that the methylation of arginines on histones can be antagonised enzymatically via deimination of arginine to citrulline, and it is therefore dynamic in nature. This offers exciting prospects that arginine methylation, as a eukaryotic post translational modification, may mirror phosphorylation in its level of complexity. Many RNA binding proteins undergo arginine methylation as a post translational modification. The methylation of arginine residues is thought to structurally alter the protein and therefore perturb protein-protein or protein nucleic interactions. We have recently used novel enrichment procedures to purify the multi protein nuclear complex from Hela nuclear cell extracts in which PSF (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein associated splicing factor) is bound to p54nrb/NonO (Non-POU-domain-containing, octamer-binding protein) and identified sites of arginine methylation in the protein PSF. It is proposed to characterise the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination of the multi-functional nuclear proteins PSF and p54nrb and further explore the roles of such modifications. It is proposed to overexpress, in E.coli, the human PSF and p54nrb proteins. Following overexpression and purification of the PSF and p54nrb proteins it is proposed to analyse the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination, following incubation of the proteins with arginine methyltrasnferases and pepidyl arginine deiminases in vitro. Mass spectrometry will be used to identify the sites of the modifications. In addition the sites of arginine methylation and citrullination will be analysed in vivo. The PSF-p54nrb complex will be enriched from Hela nuclear cell extracts using novel open tube capillaries and the sites of such modifications will be analysed using mass spectrometry. To aid the identifications of the sites of such modifications using mass spectrometry, it is proposed to develop a variety of approaches including the use of stable isotopes including 13C SAM and H218O for the in vitro reactions and 13CD3 methionine for labeling and quantitation of the sites of methylation in vivo. In an approach to study the roles of the post translational modifications of PSF and p54nrb it is proposed to analyse the kinetics of the interactions of both the modified and unmodified proteins with both protein and nucleic acid substrates using surface plasmon resonance. In addition it is proposed to use proteomic approaches to identify novel interacting partners of PSF and p54nrb, moreover study the effects of arginine methylation and deimination on the interacting proteins associated with PSF and p54nrb.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201755</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Australian National University (ANU)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Australia, Commonwealth of</gtr:country><gtr:department>College of Medicine, Biology &amp; Environment (CMBE)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Research collaboration with Australian National Laboratory</gtr:description><gtr:id>92E40353-8D2D-4750-84EB-B3E42AA1B44D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Extensive histone post-translational modification in honey bees Dickman MJ, Kucharski R, Maleszka R, Hurd PJ.

We have developed novel peptide separations at neutral pH in conjunction with electron transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry that results in the enhanced analysis of arginine methylation. These approaches have been successfully used to characterise sites of arginine methylation of a number of important proteins including PSF both in vivo (in conjunction with heavy methyl SILAC) and in vitro following methylation of PSF with PRMT1 (Snijders AP et al. J Am Soc Mass Spectrom. 2010, 1, 88-96). Furthermore, we have shown that PSF can be citrullinated in vitro by PADI4 at arginine residues that are methylated in vivo, therefore demonstrating that citrullination blocks arginine methylation of PSF in vitro.



Using this developed methodology we also identified and characterised sites of arginine methylation in RNA and export factor binding protein (REF). Moreover, in collaboration with Prof Stuart Wilson, University of Sheffield, it was demonstrated that arginine methylation modulates its RNA binding affinity and ensures efficient handover of mRNA to TAP/NXF1 from REF (Hung ML et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2010, 38, 3351-61) 



The development of mass spectrometry based approaches for the identification and characterisation of protein post translational modifications developed during the course of this grant also facilitated the the identification of a wide range of PTMs (methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation) of the Histone linker proteins H1 and H5 from chicken erythrocytes, providing further evidence that such PTMs of the linker histones play a role in chromatin remodelling and gene regulation (Snijders et al., J. Proteome. Res., 2008,7,4326-35). Furthermore, the funding and the tools developed acted as a springboard for a collaborative research to identify a novel toxin from Burkholderia pseudomallei (BPSL1549). Mass spectrometry studies revealed that the toxin promotes deamidation of glutamine-339 of the translation initiation factor eIF4A, abolishing its helicase activity and inhibiting translation (Cruz-Migoni A., et al., Science. 2011 334, 6057, 821-4).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The UK proteomics development and user community including government-funded and industrial, and those who support it will benefit from the bioanalytical tools that we have developed. The UK pharmaceutical and biological industries will be able to take advantage of the these methods for application in their own specific biological systems. 



In addition this research has provided further insight into important biological systems including RNA export and RNA transcription/splicing. These important phenomena are associated with human health and disease. The novel analytical tools we have developed for the identification and characterisation of protein methylation will be of significant interest to those groups both academic and industrial for application in there own specific biological systems of interest. Direct application of these tools can be utilised by academic and industrial researchers analysing protein methylation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>297A7105-4A91-4407-AA84-AA69A0F95D39</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have developed an new assay using peptide separations at neutral pH, resulting in increased retention of the hydrophilic/basic methylated peptides before identification using MS/MS. Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) mass spectrometry was then used to identify and characterize methylated residues. In contrast to previous reports utilizing ETD for arginine methylation, we observed significant amount of side-chain fragmentation. Using heavy methyl stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture it was shown that, similar to CID, a loss of monomethylamine or dimethylamine from the arginine methylated side-chain during ETD can be used as a diagnostic to determine the type of arginine methylation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CE9F466-342D-4968-AB30-E2D4404CF8E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The use of electron-transfer
