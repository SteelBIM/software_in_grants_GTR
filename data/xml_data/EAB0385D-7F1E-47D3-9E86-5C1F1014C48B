Many lung diseases including chronic obstructive airways disease (COPD), pneumonia, influenza, and some forms of pulmonary fibrosis (PF) are characterised by lung inflammation. White blood cells, or leukocytes, travel continuously throughout the body to protect against infection, but in excessive numbers they can result in damage to the lung, and it is essential that these cells are cleared efficiently during the resolution of inflammation. Although much is known of how leukocytes enter the lung, much less is known about how they leave or are cleared from the lung as a patient revoers. We have shown that leukocytes can leave the lung by passing into the airways where they can be coughed up, as phlegm. However, leukocytes may also pass into the alveoli of the lung where gas exchange takes place. If they are not removed quickly they can worsen the condition of the patient. 

We are aiming to understand what regulations this leukocyte egression into the airways or into the alveoli. If we understand this then we may be able to promote the resolution of lung inflammation and speed the recovery from lung diseases. We have found that specific molecules called ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 on the lung cells are required for leukocytes to move into different parts of the lung and we have shown that other proteins called Slits can alter the migration of the leukocytes. We have also shown that ICAM-1 and -2 are present at different levels between the airways and in the alveoli. In addition there is a difference in levels of Slits between the airways and the alveoli. We suggest that differential expression and regulation of key adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and ICAM-2, together with Slits, act to localise leukocytes to the airways instead of the alveoli. We propose that such localisation promotes resolution of inflammation and our project will investigate this further. Our ultimate aim is to develop novel agents to aid recovery of patients with lung inflammation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>During resolution of lung inflammatory diseases, leukocytes can leave the lung interstitium across the epithelial barrier passing into the airways or alveolar air-space. This is termed 'transepithelial migration' or 'egression'. Egression across the bronchial epithelium allows leuckoytes to be cleared on the mucociliary escalator; in contrast egression across the alveolar epithelium may interfere with alveolar gas exchange. 

We have shown that the integrin LFA-1 interacting with its ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 on the epithelium is required for egression across the bronchial epithelium but nothing is known of migration across the alveolar epithelium. As well as the importance of adhesion molecules, other factors play a role in regulation of egression. We are interested particularly in the highly evolutionary conserved Slit/Robo family of neuronal guidance molecules that are expressed at high level in the brain and the lung and to a lesser extent in all other organs. There is a gradient of Slit2 in the lung (produced by bronchial epithelial cells; BECs) with high levels in the bronchial airspace, but with little or no Slit2 in the alveolar air space . We have shown effects of hSlit2/Robo signalling both on epithelial cell adhesion and junctional stability and on leukocyte chemotaxis and polarisation.

Based on (a) differences in expression of the integrin ligands ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 in bronchial and alveolar epithelium (b) the evidence for differential expression of Slit2/Robo1 between the alveolar and bronchial epithelium (3) The ability of Slit/Robo to alter integrin activity, with effects on BEC and leukocytes; We propose that differential expression and regulation of key adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1 and ICAM-2 together with cytoskeletal modulators such as Slit2/Robo1 act to confine and localise sites of leukocyte-epithelial interactions to promote resolution of inflammation and our project will address this hypothesis.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. Contributions to a postdoctoral candidate's career development:
- This body of work will allow a postdoctoral researcher to undertake further specialised research training in biomedical sciences. This would offer many unique opportunities, including the chance to work in a multidisciplinary setting, learning new techniques and being exposed to new ideas. The international nature of the novel, high quality research performed at the CRR presents an excellent training opportunity.
- Advanced scientific training. Whilst carrying out this work a postdoctoral researcher will gain valuable research experience, as well as further training in clinical translational research, and exposure to innovation and commercialisation of research. This project with Dr Porter and Prof Laurent will equip the researcher with complementary skills raging from sophisticated in vitro models of human disease, through genetically modified mouse models, and on to human patient research. Together with state of the art technologies, the researcher will be well positioned to achieve a further academic position in the UK. 

2. Effects on the host
- General effects on scientific research: The project is of great interest to Dr Porter and the appointment of a post doctoral researcher will allow this programme of work to move forward. The CRR and the UK scientific community in general will benefit.
- Outreach activities: Dr Porter is the Medical Director of the charity Breathing Matters that seeks to educate patients and the public on the work that the CRR carries out for lung disease. The appointed researcher will contribute and update the public on their scientific progress.

3. Contribution to UK health
One of the objectives of the MRC is to improve the health of UK citizens while addressing health issues. The project proposed is very relevant to the chronic diseases faced today. 
- Relevance to Chronic Lung Diseases This project could not come at a more relevant time: Lung disease is one of the biggest single causes of morbidity and mortality world wide, but in contrast to heart disease and cancer this area has been relatively under funded and under researched. The medical costs of lung disease pose a huge drain on national resources. Currently 1 in 5 UK citizens die from lung disease, and with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and pulmonary fibrosis (PF) on the rise, more people are predicted to die from these diseases in the future. There is a need of more knowledge on the precise factors that promote lung inflammation to provide the basis for effective preventive public health measures.
- Relevance to Rare Diseases and potential for orphan drug development. There is particular concern in about Rare Diseases, those that affect less than 1 person in 2000. However, although each rare disease only affects a small number of people, there are around 8000 different rare diseases that between them affect an estimated 3.6 million people in the UK. Rare diseases are a serious public health concern. PF and cystic fibrosis are two of these rare diseases that will be addressed in this proposal.
- Relevance to Translational Research in Major Diseases The UK needs to invest in tackling issues such as respiratory disease now, to save in massive healthcare costs in the future. This project will investigate the role of leukocyte egression in lung diseases. Industry is also turning its attention to respiratory illness and in particular rare diseases, as the legislation process for drugs for rare diseases, so called &amp;quot;orphan drugs&amp;quot; is less stringent than for other diseases 
- Strengthening the UK Research Area: The CRR at UCL is one of the expert units working on PF and other lung diseases in the UK. Our momentum in this area is gathering speed and this is a perfect time for new researchers join UCL</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>448933</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Role of TGF-beta in platelets and MK in inflammation and ILD</gtr:description><gtr:id>470A291A-2F93-4A98-9D10-2EDEE07B0BEF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is on going work and no outputs so far.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They have supplied the mouse that has TFG-beta knocked out of megakaryocytes and platelets</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We are examining the role of platelet derived TGF-beta in lung inflammation.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL Faculty of Medical Sciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>Platelet trafficking in ILD</gtr:description><gtr:id>0C27674D-FADA-4AA0-87C7-50EF1FCA74A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing work</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>They have contributed cell labelling expertise and imaging</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Collaboration with nuclear medicine to examine the trafficking of platelets and neutrophils in patients with ILD</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Breathing Matters Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7626C831-4073-4115-86FA-8C52C3E828E4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>100 fundraisers and patients attended a evening to celebrate the work of the Breathing matters charity of which I am the medical director.
