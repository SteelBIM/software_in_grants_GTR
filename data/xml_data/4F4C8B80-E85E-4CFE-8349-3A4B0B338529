Family relationship experiences and parent mental health symptoms have been identified as factors that may underlie individual differences in children's symptoms of psychopathology. Yet questions remain as to the relative role of family level influences on children's mental health problems and the factors that may mediate and/or moderate these associations. The proposed programme of research will employ four complementary datasets that together will advance understanding of the interplay between family interaction patterns, parent mental health problems and child symptoms of psychopathology (e.g., depression, conduct problems). These datasets include a longitudinal US adoption-at-birth sample (N&amp;gt;500), a UK sample of children conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF, N&amp;gt;1000), a UK longitudinal sample of adolescent children at familial risk for depression (N&amp;gt;300), and a cohort longitudinal study of children followed from birth to present age 38+ years (N&amp;gt;900, living in New Zealand). The proposed programme of research will advance three core objectives: (1) to substantively improve understanding of how family relationship processes and parent mental health problems affect mental health outcomes for children and adolescents, and to identify factors that mediate and moderate pathways, (2) to implement a mentorship model that will help develop world-class methodological and knowledge-transfer skills that will promote prospects for a sustainable career of international standing in the future, while also contributing to the promotion of transferable skills for UK social science, and (3) to facilitate engagement with relevant practice and policy agencies to promote knowledge transfer and implementation of findings in order to advance the next generation of intervention and prevention programmes with the objective of improving outcomes for children and families in the UK (and internationally). Collectively, a central objective of the proposed programme of research is to facilitate advanced training in two primary areas. First, training in the application of advanced multivariate statistics and the analysis of longitudinal data will be emphasised throughout the training/fellowship period. Second, training will be directed toward promoting skills development that facilitate engagement with practice and policy agencies in relation to dissemination and impact related activities specific to the programme of research outlined. Mentorship, training and support in these areas will allow the applicant to compete at an international level in relation to emerging knowledge and skills in this area in the future, and also contribute to the development of a recognised skills deficit in the UK in the area of advanced multivariate statistics, thereby improving the knowledge base in this area and increasing the prospect of knowledge transfer for future UK social scientists. Principal mentorship support will be provided by Professor Gordon Harold (University of Sussex) within the research environment provided by the School of Psychology and the Rudd Centre for Adoption Research and Practice. This Centre is a newly established centre of excellence for the study of family processes and child development and the utilisation of large-scale data resources with the expressed purpose of generating evidence-led knowledge for the development of intervention-prevention programmes and working with practice and policy agencies in the UK and internationally. Collectively, the proposed programme of research, mentorship model, and access to practice and policy partners will help locate the applicant as a future world leader in the field of child and adolescent mental health, an area of recognised critical social, clinical and policy relevance to the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed programme of research linked to this fellowship application will offer benefits in the short and long-term to academic, child and family policy, practitioner, and advocacy agencies working to help promote positive outcomes for children and families in the UK and internationally. In addition, advanced training in multivariate statistics and the analysis of longitudinal data will be provided for the applicant that will both promote the prospects of an independent academic career and help consolidate an emerging reputation as a researcher of international standing. As outlined in the proposed programme of research, the project will utilise a longitudinal US adoption-at-birth sample (N&amp;gt;500), a UK sample of children conceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF, N&amp;gt;1000), a UK longitudinal sample of adolescents at familial risk for depression (N&amp;gt;300), and a cohort longitudinal study of children followed from birth to present age 38+ years (N&amp;gt;900, living in New Zealand). Across the complementary research design attributes that these national and international data resources represent, the project will advance three core objectives: (1) to substantively advance understanding of how family relationship processes and parent mental health problems influence adverse mental health outcomes for children and adolescents, and to identify factors that mediate and moderate pathways, (2) to implement a mentorship model that will help develop world-class methodological and knowledge-transfer skills that will promote prospects for a sustainable career of international standing in the future, while also contributing to the promotion of skills in this area for UK social science, and (3) to facilitate engagement with relevant practice and policy agencies in the UK and internationally to promote knowledge transfer and implementation of findings to advance the next generation of intervention and prevention programmes with the objective of improving outcomes for children and families in the UK (and internationally). While findings derived from the proposed programme of research will retain relevance to promoting new knowledge relating to family process influences on child and adolescent mental health among biologically related parents and children (as has been the predominant focus of past research in this area), the project also offers unique opportunity to advance knowledge and understanding of these questions and related processes specific to children and parents who are not fully genetically related to each other (e.g. adoption, foster-care, assisted reproduction). Practice and policy based partnerships already established through the Rudd Centre for Adoption Research and Practice will facilitate impacts of benefit to children, parents and families in the UK (and internationally), as represented by core study objectives and proposed pathways to impact. In addition, training and dissemination activities linked specifically to the application of advanced statistical methods to the analysis of longitudinal data will be a core focus of project linked impact activities. Utilisation of secondary data resources (both nationally and internationally) requires the application of state-of-the-art data analytic approaches if these resources are to be fully maximised and if the UK is to retain capacity at an international level in this area of expanding interest (e.g., utilising existing UK and international cohort studies). Training in the application, interpretation and implementation of research findings to relevant practice and policy domains using advanced statistical methods, as well as dissemination of knowledge to other UK social scientists using these approaches will serve as a centrepiece of the proposed programme of research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Otago</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>New Zealand</gtr:country><gtr:description>Access to Christchurch Health and Development data set</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7F1B77C-D24A-4E93-BD7E-06F361BF565F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data analysis and preparation for publication is ongoing during the life of this grant.

Interventions targeting the inter-parental relationship and parenting processes show significant intervention related reductions in child internalizing and externalizing problems. However, most evidence-based parenting and couple-focused interventions result in small to medium effects on children's emotional and behaviour problems. Findings from this research proposes that there is opportunity to improve upon these interventions through incorporation of knowledge from genetically sensitive research designs. Three core recommendations are provided for practitioners engaging in intervention work with children and families. These recommendations are contextualized relative to what genetically sensitive research designs can tell us about the role of the inter-parental relationship and parenting behaviours on child outcomes (Harold et al, 2017).
Further work in this area and further outputs are pending.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings highlight the importance of family factors for the development of child mental health.
