In Zambia it remains a major challenge, despite legalised abortion and a favourable policy framework. This project aims to maximise the impact of research that has investigated the socio-economic costs of unsafe and safe abortion for women, their households and the Zambian health system. Using the findings from this research, the impact maximisation project will conduct dissemination activities in Zambia to engage with health professionals involved in providing or referring for abortion-related care, international NGOs involved in abortion care delivery and members of civil society and parliament, in addition to international academics and advocacy NGOs. Methods include:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>development of web-based materials for women seeking information about abortion and phone-in radio shows on 'pregnancy crises'&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>capacity development of journalists in reporting research on abortion&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>workshops for and presentations to health professionals&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>focused liaison with INGO research teams and peer-to-peer research networking events&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>tailored one-to-one briefing meetings with members of civil society and Parliament&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Social Science Cafes to communicate research findings and facilitate uptake among invited audiences of policymakers, service providers and journalists.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This Impact Maximisation proposal significantly extends and deepens the research beneficiaries described in the original research proposal to include:
i) Zambian girls and women who might need to access abortion care services 
ii) health professionals (nurses, doctors) involved in providing, or making referrals to, abortion care services
iii) international NGOs involved in abortion care service delivery in Zambia
iv) members of Zambian civil society and Parliament. 

In our Pathways to Impact document we describe in detail, for each of these 4 research beneficiary groups:
- impact activities to date
- new Impact Maximisation activities
- the involvement of any intermediary organisations or networks
- short-term outputs (during the funded Impact Maximisation phase)
- longer-term outputs (after the end of the funded Impact Maximisation phase)
- monitoring and evaluation of each activity
- project team member with responsibility for delivering individual impact activity
- resource (including training) requirements of each impact activity

Our impact activities, segmented by research beneficiary, build on the expertise of team members:

i) Adolescents and women:
- Development and testing of appropriate and accessible web-based materials (Mwense)
- Phone-in radio shows on &amp;quot;Pregnancy crises&amp;quot; (Mwense)
- Capacity development of Zambian journalists in reporting research on abortion (Oronje, Mutheu)

ii) Health professionals:
- Audience-specific workshops for nurses and doctors (Vwalika, Mwense)
- Presentations at events for health professionals (Vwalika, Sikateyo)

iii) NGOs (Zambian and Intrernational) involved in abortion care services:
- Peer-to-peer research networking events in Zambia and internationally (Coast, Sikateyo, Hukin)
- Focused liaison with INGO research teams, including those with related research elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa (Coast, Murray, Hukin)

iv) Members of Zambian civil society and Parliament
- One-to-one briefing meetings with information tailored specific to their needs (Sikateyo)
- Capacity development in elites communication (Zulu, Oronje)

Social Science Cafes
We will also host two Social Science Cafes in Lusaka. This is a research communication technique to communicate research findings, and facilitate research uptake, to specially invited audiences of elites that will involve a mix of policy makers, service providers and journalists. Social Science Cafes have been used successfully by team members (Mutheu, Oronje, Zulu) elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa to communicate research findings. The first Social Science Caf&amp;eacute; will be facilitated by experienced team members, and will also serve to capacity build other team members to deliver the second Caf&amp;eacute;. By selectively inviting some of those individuals who will have attended our audience-specific workshops, alongside other stakeholders, we will be able to stimulate discussion amongst participants, rather than a undirectional flow of information from the research team to an audience.
 
Impact evaluation
We will collect data in order to monitor and evaluate the research uptake from the impact activities. One team member (Hukin, with oversight from Coast) will have responsibility for the design, development, maintenance and analyses of all data collected as part of the monitoring and evaluation of our impact activities. It is anticipated that the Impact Maximisation activities will produce:
- pre- and post-test evaluations of web-based resources by Zambian adolescents and women 
- web analytics data (including data on re-blogging and re-tweeting content)
- media content analysis, including from the planned radio phone-in shows
- requests for information about research findings, by audience type 
- workshop assessments by audience (midwives, clinicians, journalists)
- analysis of discussions generated by Social Science Cafes</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>84452</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Guttmacher Institute</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conceptual framework for understanding trajectories to safe or unsafe abortion</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCBD061E-C664-49A0-A314-F1383B0D698A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/58107/</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing and writing of plenary presentation at IUSSP workshop, IUSSP working paper, and currently, a full paper for submission to peer-previewed journal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Developing a conceptual framework for the study of induced abortion</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ohio State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Conceptual framework for understanding trajectories to safe or unsafe abortion</gtr:description><gtr:id>995F0159-057A-441F-90CE-A8D89D08EAB0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/58107/</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing and writing of plenary presentation at IUSSP workshop, IUSSP working paper, and currently, a full paper for submission to peer-previewed journal.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Developing a conceptual framework for the study of induced abortion</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>2015.02.28_National Symposium for Junior Doctors</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C6743EBA-31CE-475C-8486-EB6419E5C8D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on the costs and consequences of unsafe and safe induced abortion in Zambia delivered by Zambia collaborator (Vwalkia) to a national symposium for Junior doctors in the Copperbelt, Zambia, on 28 February 2015.

We presented our thinking and activities around maximising the impact of our research project investigating the socio-economic costs of unsafe and safe abortion for women, their households and the Zambian health system. The session was in the form of a 'conversation' in which the Fellows had put together questions in advance and 'interviewed' us. The audience then had time to ask more questions. 

The session sparked questions and discussions, both within the session and later during the seminar.

This was very useful in highlighting to us how we could present the findings of the research in a way that minimises general anti-abortion opposition but engages stakeholders in the evidence around unsafe abortion.

Following the presentation , the Policy Advisor at Marie Stopes Zambia (MSZ), a key stakeholder, emailed the PI (Coast) to ask for the presentation and further information about the study, noting that lack of data, especially with regards to the incidence of unsafe abortion, is hampering an evidence-based debate that could lead to progress in the field.

During the meeting, the current activities and debates of the national Technical Working Group (TWG) of Adolescent Health, of which the Adolescent Health Liaison Officer is a member, was discussed. This TWG, comprised of government (e.g. Ministries of Health and Community Development and Mother and Child Health) and non-government (e.g. UNICEF) stakeholders has a very strong influence in setting the sexual and reproductive health agenda for young people in Zambia and is currently revising the national 20114-2015 Adolescent Health Strategic Plan. Having our research presented at the TWG monthly meeting would allow participants in that meeting to use it to shape the agenda and inform their decision making. Subsequently, following the UNICEF Officer's request, the research team produced a PowerPoint presentation of the research findings, situated within targeted analyses of the publically-available Zambian Demographic and Health Survey data for delivery at the next national TWG meeting. These were presented at the meeting by the UNICEF Officer.

We found that publicly-accessible factual information on safe abortion and where to get further help is extremely scant, that young people in urban areas (the population most at risk of unsafe abortion in our Lusaka-based study) use Facebook, as the internet service pre-loaded onto smart phones in Zambia, to search for information and that there is currently no reliable information available on Facebook. We have therefore created a Facebook page aimed at men and women in Zambia who are seeking information on terminating a pregnancy. The page contains some information, but importantly directs users to established and ongoing providers of information, advice and services - Marie Stopes, Ipas and the Planned Parenthood Federation of Zambia. These organisations have free helplines, email contact forms and advice centres, but are not currently advertising them directly to the public online. The static Facebook Page will therefore continue to be relevant and useful beyond our funded project.

We have only just created the Facebook page. We will pilot the page with young people during a co-creation session in Lusaka we have planned for March 2015.

Our session was well-attended by other academics funded by the ESRC or ESRC-DFID and staff working at ESRC and DFID, including the head of the Research and Evidence Division at DFID. The workshop was a series of short presentation interspersed with time for group discussion and feedback. 

Attendance at the conference also gave us an opportunity to meet with representatives from ESRC Communications and ask questions about how we can get our findings publicised via their Press Office.

The research project 'Pregnancy termination trajectories in Zambia' was run by a team of researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), King's College London and the Lusaka University Teaching Hospital. The study had the following objectives:
? Understand the role that socio-economic circumstances play in the seeking of abortion and abortion-related services in Zambia
? Estimate and compare the socio-economic implications of safe abortion and post abortion care (PAC) for women and their households
? Understand how and why safe abortion services are not used more fully.

The project produced the first national estimates of the health system costs of abortion in Zambia, showing that each year, unsafe abortion costs the Zambian health system up to US$20.4 million more than if the pregnancies had been terminated safely and legally. It also provided a detailed description of the influences and pathways to seeking an abortion and an analysis of the determinants and economic consequences of abortion-seeking. These findings have been published in articles in: Social Science and Medicine; Global Public Health; Health, Policy and Planning. An article on men's roles in women's abortion care-seeking is under review with a peer-reviewed journal, and three further articles are in preparation. 

The target audiences reached with these findings were:
? National policy makers 
? Service providers and clinical practitioners in sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
? NGO advocacy networks, including international NGOs (INGOs)
? International funders
? Journalists and those shaping men and women's understanding of reproductive and sexual health rights and services 
. International academics and researchers working on the topic of abortion

The ultimate beneficiaries were women seeking to terminate a pregnancy though a direct impact on them was not sought in the timeframe of the project. However, a FaceBook page, developed as part of the IMG activities in response to our evidence that showed a lack of credible information about abortion law and services in Zambia, is now being used by women and men seeking information about abortion.

At the start of the IMG a thorough stakeholder analysis was conducted, which refined and focused the impact activities. 

The main engagement methods were i) meetings with stakeholders to discuss the findings of the research and ii) holding workshops and presentations. Initially, setting up meetings involved cold-calling stakeholders and offering to share the research findings with them. The team focused on asking stakeholders how they could help them make full use of the findings, and provided them with tailored evidence, case studies, slides, speaking at their events or running a training session for their staff. After a meeting, lines of communication were upheld for the stakeholder to ask further questions or request help. A combination of ongoing communication and flexible collaboration proved very successful. 

The impact activities reached all of their target groups, with tailored dissemination outputs, specifically the data presented and language used, to the relevant audience. None of the events in Zambia were purely for academics but always engaged people from practice or policy. 

Dissemination not only involved sharing the project's own findings, but presented findings in conjunction with the existing research done in this field in Zambia, other African countries and beyond. This approach was not only more informative for the audience, but also meant that the impact work had higher credibility, showing how the research findings built on the existing body of evidence. 

Dissemination was also combined with skill sharing and capacity building.

An independent review of the project's impact work was conducted by ECORYS on behalf of ESRC-DFID. This review sought feedback from Zambian users and revealed that they appreciated the collaborative approach the research team had taken, and highlighted the exceptional diversity of stakeholders that the project engaged with. 

Combining dissemination with capacity building, in a series of events in Zambia, the researchers trained reproductive and sexual health practitioners (including obstetrician gynaecologists) on the legal framework around providing abortion services and on effectively engaging and communicating with media professionals, and novice, early career and established radio producers, journalists, presenters and media producers of BBC Media Action Zambia on doing research and on SRH and abortion in Zambia, reporting on SRH and use of evidence. Training with media professionals generated ideas for news articles and on radio programmes that could be and were subsequently produced on the subject of abortion. 

In terms of adding knowledge to the existing evidence base, the study provided the first national estimates of health system costs of abortion in Zambia. The team also provided an insight into the social and economic factors affecting abortion-seeking and raised awareness of the legal framework of abortion in Zambia. Interaction with key stakeholders during the impact maximisation work led to an invitation to contribute our findings to the (forthcoming) 2nd Edition of the Zambian Guidelines and Standards for reducing unsafe abortion morbidity and mortality in Zambia.

The team has seen a great demand for the data it generated and also for further conceptual research and primary data collection in this area: 
? The study has provided NGO advocacy groups evidence which they use in campaigns and trainings
? Zambian medical practitioners are now asking for exact figures on how many maternal deaths are due to unsafe abortions
? Participation in international fora has led to i) a new research collaboration with American academics to develop a conceptual framework for the study of trajectories to abortion. This work has received positive feedback from other academics as well as three leading NGOs that they find the framework useful and that it will inform their work promoting SRH and safe abortion globally ii) an invitation to develop a critical history of medication abortion in Zambia for an edited volume iii) Invitation (accepted) to share research approaches and methods with non-academic researchers at an INGO in Mexico in October 2016 iv) invitation to develop funding bids on abortion (results pending) with international researchers (academic and non-academic) 
? The team gained funding from LSE to do further research on abortion and conscientious objection in rural areas in Zambia. They developed this proposal following is came out of a conversation with a meeting with a senior Ministry of Health employee who expressed that this is a gap in knowledge that policy makers need more evidence to be able to improve services to reduce unsafe abortion. The fieldwork is completed and the findings are being written up for publication; preliminary findings have already been presented at an international workshop in Senegal.
- The team gained funding from LSE to do further research on abortion policy and legal change in Malawi. The fieldwork is completed and the findings are being written up for publication.

The mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) research has produced:
- The first national estimates of the health system costs of abortion in Zambia, showing that unsafe abortion costs the Zambian health system up to $2.4 million more than if the pregnancies has been terminated safely and legally.
- Detailed description of the influences and pathways to seeking an abortion, highlighting: the roles played by men; the importance of knowing someone who works for the health sector; low levels of knowledge about the legality of abortion in Zambia; and, the risks that women will take in order to terminate an unsustainable pregnancy.
- Analyses of the determinants and economic consequences of abortion care-seeking reveal: Younger women are more likely to seek an unsafe abortion than older women; poorer women are more likely to seek an unsafe abortion, even though the costs of unsafe abortion for individual women are 27% higher than the costs associated with a safe abortion; the low levels of effective contraceptive access and use, particularly for adolescents and postpartum women.
In sum, the research shows that Zambia is not yet realising the substantial investment (legal and health services) it has made in safe abortion. 

To date, 1 article is forthcoming(Global Public Health), 1 article is under review (Health, Policy &amp;amp; Planning), 1 is under review (for Social Science and Medicine) and a further 6 are in preparation. Research has been presented at a range of events with diverse audiences, including by invitation (Oxford University, IPPF), at international conferences and workshops (IUSSP, PAA), and in Zambia to policymakers, practitioners and journalists. Participation in international fora have led to a new research collaboration with American academics to develop a conceptual framework for the study of trajectories to abortion (in preparation).

Methodological innovation
The study used an innovative mixed methods interview which combined quantitative and qualitative techniques in one interview. This technique allowed us to capture both the individual fine-grained narratives, which are not easily captured in a questionnaire-type survey, especially on such a sensitive area, as well as survey data. Rather than conducting an in-depth qualitative interview and a survey, our method reduced the burden on the respondent, avoiding repetition of questions and reducing the time taken.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings are being taken forward and put to use by a range of actors, including MPs, INGOs, academics, health professionals and journalists - impact maximisation work on-going</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>506D2FBF-F2F3-437A-AE6F-9D45A3573CE9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://zambiatop.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Training materials for Medecins du Monde</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0EF687D-2238-4B3D-8325-17D072A39A00</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution towards and acknowledgement of Co-I (Leone) in Countdown 2015 report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8009C3FD-22BC-49B8-BE0D-48B7BCF279B9</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/reports-and-articles/2014-report</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Revision of Zambian Standards and Guidelines on Abortion</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>134776B7-6D95-49BD-AF85-7734A16E3DDB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Novel 2 interviewer method for simultaneous quantitative and qualitative data collection from women who have had an abortion</gtr:description><gtr:id>FEF6EDC0-7412-4124-9609-84D78BD29A01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invitation (accepted) to work with a Mexican INGO to develop these approaches and tools for new (funded) research in Mexico City.
