Briefly, executive functions include our ability to reason, plan ahead, multi-task or switch between tasks, sustain attention, delay gratification, and make complex decisions and change dramatically between childhood and adulthood. Children from Asia are widely reported to outperform children from North America Europe on EF tasks, but this evidence is focused almost entirely on young children and largely ignores the question of whether there are cross-cultural differences in EF for older children and adults.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project includes two studies that have been carefully designed to establish the validity, magnitude and universality of any East-West contrast in children?s EF performances. Together, these studies have three key goals:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>to improve the measurement of children?s EF by developing psychometrically robust, culturally-fair task batteries that are suitable for use across a broad range of ages&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to enhance our understanding of putative cultural contrasts by examining links between within-group variation in EF performance and parenting factors&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to explore whether the link between EF and academic achievement show cultural universality and the extent that parental factors influence this link.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The impetus for this proposal came from the PI and co-PI's interest in conducting research on the cultural factors that influence cognitive development and is an extension of an existing project that the co-PI has with the HK Institute of Education. By partnering up with researchers in the Departments of Educational Psychology and Psychology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and capitalising on their existing connections with local schools, the PI and co-PI are well-placed to communicate findings directly with educational practitioners (and those responsible for training teachers) in the UK and Hong Kong. For example, the PI regularly supervises and gives presentations to teachers and teacher trainers through her post in the University of Cambridge Faculty of Education and the CI has been a regular contributor to the Faculty's professional development workshops, which are well attended by teaching professionals in East Anglia. Thus the short term beneficiaries in both countries consist primarily of educational practitioners. In the UK and Hong Kong, policy-makers have recognized the need to invest in the family factors on cognitive development (SEAL in UK, and APASO, Assessment Program for Affective and Social Outcomes commissioned by the Education Bureau in HK), but progress to date has been hampered by the lack of effective outcome measures. By developing a battery of psychometrically robust instruments for assessing children's acquisition (and use) of executive functions, this proposal will have a positive impact on existing intervention programmes (e.g., Sure Start), such that in the long term, beneficiaries from this study will include large numbers of children in both countries, including children who lag behind their peers in terms of cognitive skills. In addition, the proposed study will, throughout the lifetime of the grant, have a positive impact on the researchers themselves, as the international dialogue required for effective collaboration will lead to a widening of horizons, both intellectually and socially. More specifically, each applicant brings a distinct set of skills and expertise, such that this bilateral project is likely to broaden and enhance the knowledge base of individual applicants. Finally, the applicants are all engaged in programmes for public outreach (e.g., via the Science Festival and Festival of Ideas hosted by the University of Cambridge), such that the beneficiaries from this research will extend beyond educational professionals (and their pupils) to include members of the general public in each country.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79621</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited talk (Shenzhen University, China)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>49BD1D77-B7A7-47BF-8692-45B3F30DD07C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Citation

The work has been disseminated in the USA, UK and China. As such, there have been a number of teachers who have been introduced to the concept of executive functions, why they matter for education, and how different educational systems and parenting practices might be influencing them. It is early in terms of tangible changes to school curricula, but our findings have created new partnerships with teachers and schools that we expect to produce additional outcomes in the future. 

The findings here have also been fed into a separate ESRC funded symposium grant - 'The Educated Brain'. This context allows us further access to teachers and policy makers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7971E878-D87D-4627-887B-859E2F1CB623</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Early analyses have already indicated some interesting results from our study of 10- to 13-year-old children and their parents. The database includes 915 children and 545 parents from Hong Kong (HK) and the United Kingdom (UK)

(1) HK and UK children and parents do not show the same patterns of executive function data. More specifically, HK children show higher short-term memory performance than UK children, UK parents and HK parents. For working memory, HK children perform better than HK parents, with both showing better performance than UK children and parents, who do not differ from each other. For inhibitory control, HK children perform better than UK and HK parents, who all perform better than UK children. For cognitive flexibility, UK children perform worse than HK children, HK parents and UK parents, with the latter three not significantly different from each other. For planning, the HK children perform better than the UK children, who do better than the HK parents, who do better than the UK parents. One surprising finding from the EF data was that the children were outperforming their parents.
(2) Children also provided a self-report on three aspects of executive functioning: planning, monitoring and self-regulation. Here, UK and HK children did not report significant differences on monitoring and self-regulation, and HK children reported more planning compared to UK children.
(3) There were some differences in reported parenting practices reported by HK and UK children. UK children reported more autonomy support, less psychological control, more parental warmth, less parental rejection, more structure and less chaos than children from HK.
(4) Interestingly, the parental reports did not follow the same patterns as the children's reports. For parents, there were no significant differences for autonomy support, parental rejection or structure. However, UK parents reported using less psychological control, more warmth, and less chaos.
(5) In terms of general cognitive ability, HK children scored higher than UK children and they scored higher on numeracy skills.
(6) We administered two literacy tasks: one task in English for UK children and Cantonese for HK children and one task in English for both. This second task allowed for a quick measure of English vocabulary, providing a proxy for bilingualism. Children from the UK had higher scores on both literacy tasks. The differences between the tasks administered in a native language could be due to translation issues in the first task.
(7) Parents and children completed the same executive function tasks. The correlations between parent and child performance were merely moderate, with planning and short-term memory not being significant for either country, inhibitory control significant for HK, and both cognitive flexibility and working memory significant for both countries. 
(8) Parent and child reports of parenting style correlated moderately (ps &amp;lt; .05, rs around .20). However, when looking at the countries separately, the correlations between parents and children for chaos in the HK sample and rejection in the UK sample were not significant.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>They have been posted to UK Data Service ReShare but are under a 12-month embargo</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A3FD590D-3296-4DCF-9DA5-EF4771D0417C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>As part of this research we have developed a sizeable database of cognitive task performance from children and their parents as well as other demographic and parenting variables that might be important for understanding cognitive development.</gtr:description><gtr:id>321A6BA4-A260-451C-A780-8B9C618B024A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The data have been uploaded to UK Data Service ReShare, but we have yet to share them.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Thinking Games Databased</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>With the funding from this grant we have further developed a website to use for data collection of cognitive tasks for large groups in classroom settings.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D573E2E9-889B-4BB6-9A18-3911E9E99114</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool has been used on a variety of projects as a way of collecting cognitive data on a wider participant sample in a way that is more convenient to traditional cognitive testing.
