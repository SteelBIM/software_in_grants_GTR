For the product to be successful a set of complementary products also need to be available that will enhance the focal product's value from the perspective of a user (Sengupta, 1998; Casadesus-Masanell and Yoffie, 2007).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to enhance our understanding of the role of such complementary interdependencies of an innovator?s products and their implications for firms and industries. To this purpose, the project includes the further development of an existing dataset on technology-based firms which will be analysed using advanced econometric techniques, the development of an international network of researchers working in the area and the diffusion of the results from the research to academic and non-academic beneficiaries. No ethical issues are involved in the project.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will focus on firms' decisions to integrate the provision of complementary products and to invest in supporting assets. Investigating these issues is expected to produce a high social and economic impact. 
The results from this project are likely to benefit POLICY MAKERS for several reasons. 
First, this research aims to identify STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. Today, more than ever, this is a relevant issue especially for the UK. The World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index showed that UK's ranking has fallen from 7th to 13th place between 1997 and 2010. Restoring competitiveness is a priority for improving the future prospects of the country as emphasized by HM Treasury Report (2010). 
Second, the performance of technology-based firms, which represents the context of this research, is key to the UK since technology-based innovation is one of the sources of competitive advantage of the country: advanced manufacturing has been responsible for over half of all exports in 2009. Ensuring the provision of complementary products and supporting assets is central to the DEVELOPMENT OF A PROSPEROUS ECO-SYSTEM OF INNOVATIVE FIRMS in advanced manufacturing. 
Third, understanding firms' decisions regarding complementary products and investment in supporting assets is important for CREATING ECONOMIC IMPACT. The existence of complementarity relationships between products, i.e. the fact that consumers use different types of products jointly (such as computers and software) and tend to evaluate them as a bundle, makes the economic destinies of companies producing them intertwined. 
UNDERSTANDING THESE ISSUES WILL INFORM POLICY MAKERS ON HOW TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THESE KINDS OF BUSINESSES CAN FLOURISH AND BE SUSTAINED, for instance by designing policies to ease access to finance for businesses in the cases of market failure in the complementary product market or facilitating cooperation between complementors (i.e. producers of complementary products). The results of this research are very consistent with the mission and most current objectives of both the UK DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS INNOVATION AND SKILLS and to the EUROPEAN DEPARTMENT OF ENTERPRISE AND INDUSTRY therefore are expected to be useful in informing policy development in the next years.

This project is also likely to provide beneficial insights for HIGH TECHNOLOGY BASED COMPANIES TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN PERFORMANCE AND SURVIVAL.
By investigating HOW TO BUILD ROBUST AND COOPERATIVE LINKAGES WITH COMPLEMENTORS, results from this research are likely to suggest to companies a mechanism to increase their productivity and long term survival. A failure in the relationships between these parties can have a domino effect on the entire system of complementary products producers. Conversely when such relationships are successful, the benefits will spill over to the entire system. 
In addition, understanding the conditions for investment in supporting assets will help companies in ALLOCATING THEIR LIMITED RESOURCES BETTER, which is a crucial issue for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Preserving the health of the 4.8 million SMEs and to protect the 60% of private sectors jobs they provide (HM Treasury, BIS, 2010) is a key component of the UK's priorities. 

In these respects this research is likely to be beneficial to COMPANIES' REPRESENTATIVE ORGANIZATIONS in Europe and the UK to develop shared management standards of cooperation with complementors. 

This project may also have potential value for the GENERAL PUBLIC. Businesses are the source of growth and employment. Enhancing the performance of UK companies is a natural response to fighting the problem of growing unemployment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-17</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-18</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>170476</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article on Sparksheet</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>06BB33A9-FBB3-4138-8A6F-1DCE9DF8CD9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article on Sparksheet (Sparksheet's Top Three Reads for July 2015)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research featured on City News</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>969D679F-57BC-4AAD-938F-266AAAC91CE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article allowed the PI to diffuse information about her research to the faculty, student and alumni community, which eventually resulted in further intellectual exchanges regarding technology

In the last few decades technological change has led to a substantial reduction in the costs of transacting and to a massive increase in connectivity and reach, stimulating a parallel reconfiguration in the architecture of many industries. Firms have been exhibiting very divergent diversification and integration patterns. Some firms have been expanding their scope considerably (e.g. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple) sometimes in vertical and sometimes in complementary or horizontal directions; others have been expanding in some directions (e.g. horizontal), but contracting in others (e.g. vertical). Some firms have even emerged as &amp;quot;virtual corporations&amp;quot;.
These patterns raise many questions that revitalize the lively debate on the knowledge and market boundaries of technology-based firms and the trade-offs that different scale and scope configurations impose to them:
?Is internal innovation still a feasible strategy in today's complex technological and product environment? To what extent can knowledge be effectively acquired through external sources and what are the costs of using this strategy for firms' economic and innovative performance?
?To what extent has technological change really reduced within-firm coordination costs and hence expanded the optimal scope of the firm? Under what conditions, instead, does technology reduce transaction costs across markets even more than within firms, so that the optimal scope of the firm is now reduced?
?Which organizational forms and related business models are likely to be the most successful in the current environment and which industry configurations are likely to emerge in equilibrium?
This workshop will bring together leading scholars that have contributed to research on knowledge and market boundaries of firms for the purpose of stimulating an interactive discussion on the topic and reflecting on new avenues for future research.

Technological change has led to an explosive increase in connectivity and reach. Globalization, open innovation, crowdsourcing, interconnected systems have all become common phenomena. Thousands of start-ups have emerged from all over the world and across all sectors with novel ways of doing business. In parallel, incumbent companies have changed. Some have grown considerably (e.g. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple), sometimes integrating their suppliers or their complementors and gaining direct access to their customers. Other companies have instead shrunk and increased their open collaboration, outsourcing or partnership practices. Some firms have even emerged as &amp;quot;virtual corporations&amp;quot;. These patterns raise many questions for managers and policy makers. How important are the size of a company and its degree of diversification to succeed in today's world? What could be the most successful competitive strategies for startups and large companies, respectively? Has technological change marked the end or the resurgence of the large corporations? What are some of the ways that companies are using technology to modify their scope and business model, using technological innovation to enhance their productivity, i.e. doing in-house what they outsourced and vice versa?

In 2016 I have also organized at Cass Business School a large engagement event aimed at facilitating a dialogue between academics, managers and policy makers on selected themes related to my research area, sponsored by my ESRC grant. The event, titled &amp;quot;How Important Are a Company Size and Its Business Scope to Succeed in Today's Business and Technological Environment?&amp;quot;, was organized as a panel event. Speakers who accepted to participate were Prof. Gautam Ahuja, Harvey C. Fruehauf Professor of Business Administration, Ross School of Business, University of Michigan; Olivier Garel, Head of Ventures, Unilever Ventures; Keith Hodgkinson, Deputy Director Innovation Technology, Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, UK Government; Prof. Gianvito Lanzolla, Professor of Strategic Leadership, Head of the Faculty of Management, Cass Business School; Xavier Louis, co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Peak; Andy Muldoon, CEO, PowaWeb, Powa Technologies; Ashish Saxena, Global Head of Marketing and Sales, LiquiForm Group, Amcor. The event, introduced by Prof. Marianne Lewis, Dean of Cass Business School, registered 300 participants including students, entrepreneurs and managers. 
In line with the spirit of fostering the diffusion of results from my research to the user community, in 2016 I have co-founded and started serving as the co-Director of the Digital Leadership Research Centre at Cass Business School (DLRC). In the same year I have started delivering sessions based on my research results to a target audience of entrepreneurs and executives. For example I have delivered a session titled &amp;quot;From Ideas to Reality: Capturing Value from Technological Innovation&amp;quot; at City Unrulyversity, targeted to the entrepreneurial community of Tech City.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C5442D17-6EAB-4BB9-AF64-D22F0B24FBC4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Published article on Research Policy on the antecedents and implications of patent scope. Synthesis appeared on ESRC Britain in 2016:
&amp;quot;Every year inventing firms invest their money to file thousands of patents that in principle provide their inventors with temporary monopolies on the use of their ideas in return for disclosing them to the public. The 'scope' of a patent, i.e. the area that it covers, is supposed to reflect the protection that the patent provides to its holder. But what are we precisely referring to when we talk about &amp;quot;patent scope&amp;quot; and to what extent a larger scope actually provides superior protection to the patent owner? Research conducted by Elena Novelli at Cass Business School focused on US patents developed by inventing firms delves deeper into this issue and suggests that patent claims and patent technological classification should be considered jointly to determine the actual 'size' of patent scope.
An inventing firm wants to avoid that another firm comes up with a small change to the original idea and calls it a new invention. Hence it will describe all possible changes to the original idea in the patent itself, so that those changes will be covered by the patent protection. These variations to the original idea are described in the patent 'claims'. A higher number of claims increases the strength of patent protection because it is a deterrent to other inventors from building on the knowledge underlying the focal patent, as they entail a higher risk of infringement. The changes described in the claims can be very marginal variations to the invention -e.g. they can refer to changes in the diameter of a component- or more 'distant' -e.g. they may refer to completely different materials from which the same component could be made. They can even refer to different technological domains - for instance textile, metal working, liquid crystals. Previous research has commonly assumed that patents that have their claims spread across many technological classes confer stronger protection to the inventing firm because they extend the protection of the patent across different technological settings.
However this is not necessarily the case. If the claims are too dispersed across technological domains the protection they provide can actually be relatively lower. When an inventing firm identifies a change to the invention and publishes it in the patent it is actually suggesting to the public how that invention could be used in another technological domain, opening up a possible new trajectory of development for the idea. But the inventing firm itself might not be in the position to exploit this trajectory and this might end up giving an advantage to other parties. For instance, patents with claims classified in more different classes have greater visibility and are more likely to 'cross' more firms' search processes. Yet, it is less likely that the focal firm has the capabilities to develop the patent along so many directions. Moreover, it may be difficult for the inventing firm to detect possible infringements across multiple technological areas. Research by Elena Novelli shows empirically that, holding constant the number of patent claims, when they refer to very distant technological classes, other firms (rather than the inventing firm itself) tend to generate patents that build on the firm's original invention - patents that in principle could rather have been developed by the focal firm itself. Moreover, this research also shows that the characteristics of firms' knowledge and experience are factors associated to firms' ability to develop patents with a broader or narrower scope.&amp;quot;

Developed additional six working papers (at different points of the review process), addressing the following questions:

-What are the best strategies to exploit the potential fungibility of firms' ideas and resources? Under what conditions are more fungible technologies better exploited via direct entry versus in strategic factor markets? 

- Which scale and scope configurations enable firms to appropriate more value from their resources?

-Under what conditions should firms reconfigure their resources in response to the emergence of a new business model? 

-How does complexity of the firm product portfolio (number of elements and interdependencies between them) and the change in interdependencies affect firm performance?
