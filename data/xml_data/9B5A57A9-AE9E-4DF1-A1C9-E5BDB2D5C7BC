Our 7 objectives are to:

1. Enhance the SLS through linkages to new datasets including the 2011 census 
The key focus of the first two years will be the linking of the 2011 census to the SLS. This work will be considerable.

We will however also:
- link the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 to the SLS. This will produce a sample of n~ 3000-3500 and provide information on the age, social class of the cohort's parents, and after the 1980s detailed health and census based information. 

- establish links, explore the validity and reliability of two main sources of child health surveillance data. 

Beyond 2014 we will be discussing with:
- a number of data holders, the possibility of linking their data to the SLS during the period 2012-2014. This will include the holders of: further and higher education data, information on educational attainment in private schools, social security, dental and prescribing data.

- NRS whether it might be feasible to develop a system that would allow 'special' samples of 'SLSs' to be drawn from a 100% population spine producing bespoke 'SLSs'. 

 2. Support access and use of the SLS by researchers
The core work of the SLS is supporting researchers through the whole life cycle of an SLS research project from application, preparation and data analysis, to publication dissemination. We also organise web-based resources that will help make use of the SLS easier and provide training on the SLS and longitudinal data handling, analysis and modelling through a series of workshops and seminars.

3. Maintain the SLS and safe setting 
We will continue with the core maintenance tasks of the study. 

4. Engage and collaborate with other ESRC investments
We will work towards a greater integration of the LSes. We will actively support the UK Census Longitudinal Study Development Hub in particular providing significant research support for a project to create a synthetic dataset that can be made available to researchers more flexibly. 

5. Promote the research potential of the SLS
We will continue to participate in national and international conferences promoting longitudinal analysis and the SLS. Our website is also an important vehicle not only for advertising the research potential of the SLS, but also for encouraging access to the resource and promoting the outputs and impacts that have already been achieved by researchers using the dataset.

6. Promote the impact of the SLS
The SLS already has a track record of directly promoting the impact of its research. Firstly we plan to conduct impact case-studies on a sample of SLS-based projects. We would also seek to continue to hold regular annual presentations and discussion workshops with key government departments. A third avenue of impact promotion planned is to approach professional private-sector bodies to discuss the types of issues directly relevant to their work which might be effectively explored using the SLS. 

7. Conduct methodological development work
A disadvantage of the current access to SLS data is that users must either visit the safe setting in the SLS unit or submit code to be run by SLS staff. The idea of synthetic data is that simulated data are produced that do not correspond to any real individuals or organisations, but maintain the distributions and the relationships between the variables that exist in the original. This can therefore be used outside the safe setting. We aim to develop a method to produce safe synthetic versions of the SLS.

We will also test the validity, reliability and utility of any new data being introduced into the SLS.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The value of longitudinal datasets has long been recognized, and the SLS was created in order to provide a high quality longitudinal research dataset that could be used to provide an insight into the demographic, health and social status of the Scottish population. Scotland had been disadvantaged relative to England and Wales in the poverty of its longitudinal databases (i.e. databases that link individuals' characteristics through time, allowing changing circumstances to be investigated) on demographic, socio-economic and health information. The SLS, fairly uniquely, allows important questions to be asked about the demographic, health and social status of the Scottish population.

This is important because Scotland differs considerably from the rest of Britain in a number of ways. For example, on average Scots live in more deprived circumstances, have lower fertility rates, higher teenage fertility rates, and are more likely to live in public housing than people living in England and Wales. In addition, overall mortality rates are higher than the rest of Britain, even when we control for age distribution and the relatively more deprived circumstances in Scotland (commonly described as the 'Scottish Effect'), and deaths from specific causes such as lung cancer and heart disease rank among the worst in Europe. Indeed, lung cancer rates for Scottish women are among the highest in the world. Thus, Scotland provides a unique demographic, socio-economic and health context within the UK, and there has been a lack of research on a number of important topics. These are all issues that can be explored using the SLS and they become especially interesting as social and health policies continue to diverge between Scotland and the rest of the UK as a result of devolution.

Because of its unique composition and the large proportion of the population it represents (5.3% of the Scottish population as compared to 1% in the England and Wales LS), the SLS provides benefits to academics from a wide range of academic disciplines, including geographers, health researchers, social scientists, economists and labour market analysts to name a few (see 'Academic Beneficiaries' above). This impact reaches beyond Scottish academics, with researchers from other UK and European countries already having used the SLS for their projects. Outputs and publications from SLS-based projects are published and presented widely in international journals and at international conferences.

In addition to this academic impact, the SLS has been also been used to examine a wide range of research questions feeding into government social, health and housing policy. This has included reports and studies conducted on behalf of the Scottish Government, Chief Scientist Office, Scottish Collaboration for Public Health Research and Policy, and Glasgow Centre for Population Health. Additionally, presentations from other SLS-based studies have been given at Scottish Government events, and several discussion papers have been published by the IZA Institute for the Study of Labor. Researchers from the department of Employability, Skills and Lifelong Learning, ISD and the NHS are also currently involved in policy-based research projects utilizing the strengths of the SLS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1406536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of Scotland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>National Records of Scotland</gtr:department><gtr:description>LSCS for extending the SLS</gtr:description><gtr:id>CEC037C6-4A23-4CB4-9BA0-CBEDA963DD34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration is multi-disciplinary and spans various funding rounds of the SLS project, covering:

1. It has changed National Records of Scotland's (NRS) statistical infrastructure - allowing new statistical series to be produced
2. It is used by local, national government and NHS officials for policy analysis, impacting local and national policy decision making
3. The study has trained over 100 researchers in longitudinal data analysis using administrative data
4. The SLS data system has become a model for the newly emerging UK national administrative data infrastructure

Changed National Records of Scotland's statistical infrastructure. 
The SLS has been accepted as a Scottish National study and as such it is now co-supported and housed within the National Records of Scotland (NRS) - the National Statistical Agency since 2004. As a longitudinal study it replaces the need for expensive traditional longitudinal surveys collected through face-to-face questionnaires (often costing up to &amp;pound;10 million). The recognition of the study by the Scottish equivalent of the Office of National Statistics as being part of the National statistical system is testament to the quality and reliability of the study. The SLS has changed the type of statistical series that NRS are producing. For example the General Registrars' report (2010), on new demographic findings, makes extensive use of the SLS; since 1855 - the General Registrars' report is annually laid before Parliament as the major statement on Scotland's population. NRS have used it to ask important questions about the nature of occupational coding (and therefore social class) on death certificates (a key statistic for government), investigating the potential exaggeration of someone's occupation status at death.

Impact on local and national policy decision making.
Since its creation, the SLS has also been used by analysts outside the academy to examine a wide range of research questions feeding into government social, health and housing policy. This has included, for example, reports and studies conducted on behalf of the Scottish Government, Scottish Public Health Observatory and the NHS. To give two examples: 
1) Researchers in Glasgow City Council used it to investigate local patterns of housing tenure change and in particular the slowing of the fall in demand for social housing. These findings were incorporated into a demographic model of tenure change, which then fed into the research base for a number of key strategic policy documents including the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Housing Needs and Demand Assessment, Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Strategic Development Plan, and Glasgow's Housing Strategy.
2) A researcher working within Scottish Government on 'return migration' work formed key evidence for the Scottish Government report, 'Characteristics and intentions of immigrants to and emigrants from Scotland - Review of existing evidence' (Eirich, 2011). This, in turn, was discussed by Skills Development Scotland, Migrants' Rights Network, National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns and the Information Centre about asylum and refugees. It was also referenced in the UK Needs Analysis Report of the EU Portfolio of Integration projects. In addition, we were recently informed by Scottish Government that the report from the Scottish Longitudinal Study project on NEETs published in 2015 directly impacted on policy in the following ways: 

1. The development of the participation measure and 'Opportunities for All'.
2. Influencing the Community Jobs Fund.
3. Impacted work with local authorities, highlighting the factors that are important for young people at risk of being NEET.
4. Impacted work with other Scottish Government departments, including health and housing and especially justice.
5. Briefing for Ministers, including First Minister's Questions.

Training researchers. 
In addition to the impacts of managing a major database for government, and producing research that impacts policy in the areas of health, education and employment, a third impact has been in training people in longitudinal data analysis and in supporting non-academic research using the SLS. SLS staff have been pro-active in organising training for those outside the academy wishing to access the SLS. Since 2008, 15 training events have been organised by the SLS team in Edinburgh, Belfast, Glasgow, London, Stirling, and St Andrews. In total 128 non-academic users have been trained including 4 people from local authorities, 8 from health boards, 110 from various sectors of the Scottish Government, and 6 from Charities or private consulting firms. Given the relatively small community of quantitative social scientists in Scotland, this represents a good proportion of potential users. As a result of this training, 10 longitudinal research projects have been launched by non-academics in the fields of health inequalities, migration, housing and employment. Overall, use of the SLS has increased considerably since it was first established. Numbers of Researchers (academic and non-academic) visiting the Safe Setting to access their data extracts rose from 25 visits to the Safe Setting in 2009 to 249 in 2016 (2010=83 visits, 2011=96, 2012=119, 2013=76, 2014=89, 2015=149).

Model for the newly emerging UK national administrative data infrastructure. 
The SLS has become a path-breaking model that allows the linkage, holding, and analysis of highly personal data within appropriately strict legal and ethical constraints. For example, the Scottish Government use it as an exemplar of good practice in their development of National Data Sharing and Linkage Service stating: &amp;quot;The SLS has been of absolute fundamental importance to the development of the new National Data Sharing and Linking Service&amp;quot;. 

The SLS has become a very important model for other parts of the UK that are seeking to produce similar studies. The Administrative Data Taskforce (ADT) (making recommendations to David Willets, the Minister of State for Universities and Science, and BIS over the future of UK wide research infrastructure) has used the design of the SLS as a model for future UK-wide research centres). The ADT argued that future &amp;quot;ADRC [Administrative Data Research Centres] could build on best practice from the experience of the . Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS)&amp;quot; (p.5) and have a &amp;quot;data linkage process ... similar to that used by the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), where personal identifying information is not held in the ADRC, but is matched through a third party service, such as the National Health Service Central Register&amp;quot; (p.6).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2003</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>042BBFE1-BD24-4D86-BED0-D1BC4C6328AB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There have been 5 main discovery and development areas:

1. Enhance the SLS through the linkage to new datasets including the 2011 census 
In the period we have successfully completed the linkage of the 2011 census and now we have three censuses, allowing a 20-year follow-up. We also achieved linkages to other administrative data such as schools data in Scotland (school census and Scottish Qualifications Authority data), dental and prescribing data (from 2009), 15 years of previous address information from historical postcode (Community Health Index) data, Child Health Surveillance Programme (CHSP - early life and school developmental and health information) data. The linkage to the 1947 Scottish Mental Survey has also been completed with a high linkage rate, which adds an important new dimension to the UK LSes with, for the first time, analysis possible for a new 1936 birth cohort linking early life context (age 11) and later life outcomes (ages 55, 65, 75).

2. Support access and use of the SLS by researchers
This support is free of charge to academic users and involves help through the whole life-cycle of an SLS project from application, the creation of the SLS data to their analysis. We also support SLS users with ISD health data by assisting their application to PBPP and liaising with eDRIS. So far we have supported 49 projects since 2012, compared to 17 in the period up to 2012, a large increase in users. As a result, the safe setting has also seen an increase in visits from 204 visits in the period up to 2012 rising to 682 visits between 2012 and 2016 (249 visits in 2016 alone). We also supported a substantial number of extensions to existing projects often tackling new research questions. We provided 17 training workshops and seminars on the SLS and longitudinal data handling, analysis and modelling. 

3. Maintain the SLS and safe setting 
We have continued the maintenance of the SLS, updating databases (including winning &amp;pound;50K of extra funding from the MRC to modernise our database structure and allow for virtual machines), software, and hardware, and improved the environment for researchers.

4. Engage and collaborate with other ESRC investments
We work towards a greater integration of the LSes. We have created and then actively supported the UK Census Longitudinal Study Development Hub (CALLS). An innovative method that allowed statistical analysis without physically moving data out of a LS support unit (eDatashield) has been developed and used by researchers. We joined forces with other RSUs and CALLs to promote the LSes in a series of roadshows/workshops. We worked together with ADRC Scotland and UKDS to share information and organise training on SLS and other LSes. 

5. Conduct methodological development work
A disadvantage of the current access to SLS data is that users must either visit the safe setting in the SLS unit or submit code to be run by SLS staff. To overcome this we have developed methods and software (SYNTHPOP) for creating synthetic data that do not correspond to any real individuals, but maintain the distributions and the relationships between the variables that exist in the original. This can therefore be used outside the safe setting. We have approval from NRS to create bespoke synthetic data for SLS data extracts for users.

Work by the SLS-DSU has resulted in a new methodology which means it is now possible to analyse data from one or more LS as though they were part of the same dataset with no data moving between units. This is achieved through a software package developed in R by the SLS called eDATASHIELD, which is currently able to support all forms of GLM regression analyses. We have active collaborations with the University of Manchester and Penn State University and our team member, Gillian Raab has been invited to share our experience of providing synthetic data with the Centre for Disease Control in Washington.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>What we are doing
The SLS already has relatively wide engagement with the academic community. We have completely redesigned our website in this phase of funding. It now follows the same structure as the UKDS and includes new features such as step-by-step instructions on how the study can be accessed. It includes a fully-functioning data dictionary jointly with other LSes and we have produced and will continue to develop a series of working papers which provide detailed information about the study. We have been very active in promoting longitudinal analysis, the use of routinely collected admistrative data and the SLS itself. In the past 5 years we have made 62 presentations on the SLS, given 46 conference papers, produced 36 research papers, authored 26 journal articles, and written 1 newspaper article on the subject of the SLS.

The SLS has always made great efforts in promoting the impact of its research. We have contributed to Science &amp;amp; Policy Network (SPiNe) Launch events organised by CALLs Hub in April 2014. Our training workshops are open to governmental researchers and we hold regular annual presentations and discussion workshops with key government departments such as ISD, NHS, Department of Employment, Skills and Lifelong learning. We have conducted impact case studies on a subset of SLS-based projects. We have a project for assessing the 2011 census quality with NRS, and supported a project with Glasgow council aimed at allowing effective forecasting of changes in housing needs. More generally we have developed a 'for the public' section on our website and added the SLS to the Wikipedia page on longitudinal studies. In the past year SLS has also had a social media presence via Twitter.

What has happened 
The governance structure, linkage methodology and estimation methods, developed by the SLS team, have been used by the Scottish Government, National government and research councils as a model for newly emerging research infrastructures. We have been integral to this process, sitting on committees, acting as experts and helping on various advisory bodies (eg the Administrative Data Taskforce). 

The research findings of external researchers using the SLS have been taken forward in wide variety of different ways, all of which are recorded on our website. We also promote these research findings, which are often applied in nature through a variety of knowledge exchange mechanisms including social media, presentations (to academice, government and the public).

Work by the SLS-DSU has resulted in a new methodology which means it is now possible to analyse data from one or more LS as though they were part of the same dataset with no data moving between units. This is achieved through a software package developed in R by the SLS called eDATASHIELD, which is currently able to support all forms of GLM regression analyses. Other users of sensitive data can benefit from this package. Similarly the methods and software SYNTHPOP for creating synthetic data will be of interest to others working with comparable restricted access data. The SYNTHPOP R package is available freely for download.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0CA0D39F-54BC-4D07-8B51-83D53DC91688</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://sls.lscs.ac.uk/outputs/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>1936 birth cohort linked to Scottish Longitudinal Study</gtr:description><gtr:id>81000D0F-E9B2-419B-B0B1-DAC6035EE708</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Huang, Z., Dibben, C., Kirby, G., Deary, I., Popham, F. &amp;amp; Connelly, F.

Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models.

Due to Data Protection concerns, the current agreements in place for the LSs mean that it is not possible to access LS data outwith its respective safe-setting. This means that to-date it has not been possible to fully combine datasets to allow comparisons between regions or to create a UK-wide sample. Instead the only option has been to conduct separate analyses and then compare or combine the results on an ad-hoc basis.

Work in the SLS-DSU has resulted in a new methodology which means it is now possible to analyse data from one or more LS as though they were part of the same dataset. This is achieved through a process called eDatashield, which is currently able to support all forms of GLM regression
