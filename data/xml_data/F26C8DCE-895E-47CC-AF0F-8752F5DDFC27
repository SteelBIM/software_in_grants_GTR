robust, even in the presence of perturbations. Thus, a greater understanding of the complex
regulatory networks that control cellular development, and how they operate, interact, and
respond to intercellular and extracellular signals is urgently needed to generate plants with
increased biomass and stress-tolerance. We propose that emergent properties of gene regulatory
networks involved in cellular differentiation can be represented and tested mathematically
using information gained from development-specific transcriptomic signatures in response to
varying conditions. To test this hypothesis we are using as a model the Arabidopsis root phloem
sieve element, for which we have developed a unique set of molecular, mathematical, and physiological
tools. Because complete differentiation of the enucleated sieve elements takes place in a
very compressed manner, within 20 cells, SEs provide a cell differentiation model of unprecedented
cellular resolution. Our goal is to integrate development-specific transcriptomic, molecular
and imaging data, with information about known key regulators using a system of ordinary differential
equations and agent based modeling. This mathematical approach will allow us to gain a comprehensive
and quantitative perspective of the design rules governing the progression from stem cells
to their final stage of differentiation. We aim to iteratively improve the accuracy and strength
of our models by integrating additional data after exposing this cellular process to two disparate
perturbations; symplastic isolation and iron deficiency.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose to identify the transcriptional signature that describes the differentiation of phloem
tissue development. We currently have seven fluorescent marker lines spanning the longitudinal
axis of the root in an overlapping manner, representing different developmental time points of phloem
(SE) differentition. After protoplasting of different marker lines, gene expression profiles of
specific phloem cell populations will be obtained using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)
coupled with RNA-seq.

We propose to build a mathematical model that simulates and predicts the dynamics of phloem
development from stem cells to their final stage of differentiation. A system of ODEs will model, first, at
a cellular level, the previously known regulating factors (some of them are mobile factors)
involved in phloem development. We will then implement the system of ODEs within different
cells along the same tissue into an agent based model (ABM). We will then add into the model signals
such as mobile transcription factors among cells.

We propose to quantitatively characterize SEs transcriptional changes in response to specific
perturbations, either by inhibiting cellular communication; or by challenging the system with
environmental stimuli. Hence, we will block cell-to-cell symplastic communication by depositing, in an
inducible manner, callose specifically between the developing SE cells; and we will subject plants to iron deficiency as this environmental perturbation may directly affect SE differentiation. 
Gene expression analysis of cells with altered symplastic communication will allow us to
identify the genes involved in cell-intrinsic signals.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?
(1) Academic researchers interested in development
(2) The agro-biotech, forestry and plant breeding communities
(3) The general public

How will they benefit?
(1) This research is basic by nature. It explores how the &amp;quot;food conductive&amp;quot; cells, sieve elements of phloem are differentiating from the stem cell at a molecular level and how during this process the cell exchanges information with the neighbouring cells. We will use this as a paradigm for cell differentiation in plants in general. By publishing in visible journals, this research will be made widely available. Furthermore, during this work we will generate high quality datasets and submit these to public depositories so that they may be mined by other researchers to facilitate multiple research topics. Understanding vascular development is also significant for understanding evolution of terrestrial plants. 
(2) Phloem is a major carbon allocation route in plants. Therefore, understanding how phloem development is controlled and how this important long-distance transport pathway is built up has important implications for various applied plant sciences, covering both field crops as well as forest trees. 
(3) Plants represents an interesting adaptation for terrestrial life. Phloem is a key innovation during this adaptation. Therefore, basic understanding on how the transporting cells of phloem develop increases also general knowledge of the important, distinctive features of plants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>247930</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>North Carolina State University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Modeling the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic signaling on cellular differentiation in plants</gtr:description><gtr:id>B61E4542-38E8-4980-A35F-B1F9832447A8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>null</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Terri Long has experience in molecular analysis and mathematical modeling of plant responses to nutrient availability, Ross Sozzani provides expertise in computational analyses of cell-type specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and dynamic mathematical modeling.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Yka Helariutta has expertise in genetic analysis of vascular development as well as in symplastic communication during plant morphogenesis.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In this project we want to understand how gene expression is controlled when a plant cell differentiates from a stem cell to an enucleate sieve element of phloem, a major transporting conduit in plants.
