This reactivity is intimately linked to the redox capabilities of such ions and, consequently, an elucidation of mechanism will always require a detailed understanding of these properties. This understanding is invariably gained through a combination of spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. In 'redox titrations' the electrochemical potential of the sample is varied systematically, using chemical reagents or electrodes/potentiostats, and the response of the cofactors is followed spectroscopically. Previously, we have developed 'MOTTLE' apparatus which allows such titrations to be followed using Magnetic Circular Dichroism (MCD), a powerful optical spectroscopic technique which can elucidate parameters such as the identity, spin-state, oxidation state and ligands of transition metal ions. MOTTLE requires that the electrochemical cell is small enough to mount in the narrow bore of the superconducting solenoid needed for the spectroscopy. Equilibration of solution state samples with the set potential of the electrode is slow and severely limits firstly the number of titration points obtainable in a set time and secondly the pathlength of the cell which in turn limits the strength of the MCD signals. We have recently demonstrated that these measurements can be performed using sample immobilised by adsorption onto tin oxide electrodes. We have also recently commissioned a new BBSRC-funded superconducting solenoid with a larger bore capable of accomodating larger cells. This proposal aims to significantly improve the capabilities of these methods by constructing a new generation of spectroelectrochemical cells which will (i) enable, for the first time, combined MCD and PFV (protein film voltammetry) and (ii) extend the range of transition metal ions which can be studied.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>96941</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Findings&amp;quot; not applicable.
