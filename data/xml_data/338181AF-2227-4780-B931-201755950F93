It has built a knowledge community and online resources to enable researchers to consider advantages and challenges presented by complexity theory in analysing the interconnections between people, ideas and practice. Through three independent pilot studies the project engaged with different dynamics of the creative economy at different scales: from idea generation and development dynamics, to collaborative work and knowledge exchange, to reconciling production and consumption and taking into account the role of intermediaries in regional creative clusters. While engaging with key issues of the creative economy the project reflected on the advantages and challenges presented by the use of complexity theory. Overall complexity theory allows researchers to unfold dynamics of different nature and directions, giving central stage to creative agents who are shaped by these dynamics while contributing to changes within local communities, creative events and activities and regional contexts. Complexity approaches used in the pilot studies have given us a clearer understanding of the multi-scale connections which characterise the creative economy as a complex system. The challenges met during the research projects - namely considering connections vs. causality and specificity vs. comparability - provide fertile venues for further research and for further expansion on the use of complexity theory in the creative economy.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>30656</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Creative practice, complexity and the creative economy'  Research Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C15D0EFA-0430-4FFC-BB52-37D9B9587899</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the symposium, there were presentations and discussions on the findings emerging from the research project. However, the symposium also aimed to be a platform for other academics or practitioners doing research on the interactions between complexity theory, creative practice and the creative economy and will provide an opportunity for knowledge sharing on the research. As such, the organizers sought contributions from academic and practitioners' discussing their investigations and experiences of using complexity theory in their research on the creative economy or in their creative practice and the potential methodological challenges involved.

The project allowed the outline of a broader framework that bridges the interrelation of ideas, people and practices in the creative economy with the broader socio, cultural and economic contexts. In particular, through 3 pilot projects, complexity-based methods were tested in different area of research (festivals, design, cultural mapping).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have informed further research collaboration with artists and arts organisations in London.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5551AE9C-30ED-44A7-9695-B7D4F5462645</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.complexity-creative-economy.net/project-outcomes.html</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BF3DE8E5-ED70-4C52-A422-879815264AF7"><gtr:id>BF3DE8E5-ED70-4C52-A422-879815264AF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cultural Mapping as Cultural Inquiry</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4eb64cf2eb2470017e1b4b7914f94060"><gtr:id>4eb64cf2eb2470017e1b4b7914f94060</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Comunian R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/063B169D-8996-4FB2-AAEA-82BA65D7596F"><gtr:id>063B169D-8996-4FB2-AAEA-82BA65D7596F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Focus on Festival: : Contemporary European Case Studies and Perspectives</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4eb64cf2eb2470017e1b4b7914f94060"><gtr:id>4eb64cf2eb2470017e1b4b7914f94060</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Comunian R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/85EB9E3B-FED2-43A5-ACCE-483A004F48FC"><gtr:id>85EB9E3B-FED2-43A5-ACCE-483A004F48FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Handbook of Services</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c179fcd2589c23081583dcca4a234293"><gtr:id>c179fcd2589c23081583dcca4a234293</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Andres L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/J501413/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
