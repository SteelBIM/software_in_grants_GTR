information in Bangladesh</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J018651/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The objective of this study is to examine how the spread of the mass media, increased access to the internet and high levels of mobile phone use are changing the ways that poor people seek health-related information and advice. In order to pick up new patterns of behaviour with the potential to spread rapidly, we will study health information seeking behaviour in one relatively remote rural area, one rural area with good transport links to Dhaka and one slum in Dhaka.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will use a questionnaire survey, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews to explore how men and women use mobile phones and how and where they find information and advice for different kinds of health problems. We will look for early adapters of new ways of using mobile phones and the internet. We will also organise interviews with key decision-makers in the health and telecommunications sectors to discuss their views of the regulatory challenges associated with a technology that enables suppliers of pharmaceuticals and specialised services to communicate directly with potential consumers.The findings will be relevant to ongoing debates about how to increase access to reliable and trustworthy health information and advice.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>National stakeholders in Bangladesh: Early in the project the research team will identify key stakeholders, who will probably include policy makers concerned with health and with government strategies to encourage the spread of ICTs, the professional regulatory agencies, heads of health departments of large national NGOs, donor agencies, and private (for profit and not-for-profit) organisations providing ICT-based health information and advice services. We will organise a workshop to review the study objectives and agree a process for providing access of all stakeholders to the study findings. We will produce a policy influence strategy based on the conclusions of the workshop. We anticipate that it will include publicising study findings on the ICDDR,B website and presenting them to the annual ICDDR,B conference on health and health systems, producing one or more policy briefs and presenting findings to a learning platform that the Future Health Systems Consortium is establishing to bring together policy-makers, researchers, and health system innovators in Bangladesh and West Bengal, in India to facilitate learning from experiences with innovative approaches to health system development. 
International stakeholders in ICTs and health: We will formulate our strategy for reaching international stakeholders in close collaboration with the Future Health Systems Consortium, the STEPS Centre and the many development information networks based at the IDS. This will enable us to disseminate our findings through websites aimed at different policy networks. We will build on existing cooperation with the Development Section of the Guardian online. We will also use discussion forums such as Eldis Communities as knowledge intermediaries for the research. We will link to international initiatives, such those on e- and m-health of the Rockefeller Foundation and the World Health Organisation. We will build on strong links between members of the research team and the Bangkok Office of the Rockefeller Foundation to ensure that study findings are disseminated to their programme partners. We will establish links with the ongoing research programme supported by the Global Alliance for Health Systems and Policy Research at the WHO. We will disseminate findings through the website of the Future Health Systems Consortium and through the website of the Centre for Health Market Innovations, organised by Results for Development, a Washington-based NGO. The PI is on the advisory group of that Center. We also intend to target potentially important global players such as the large mobile telephone companies and large internet based knowledge intermediaries, in our international policy influence and research uptake strategy. 
Academic Community: Our strategy for reaching the academic research community will take advantage of links that the research team have with the Future Health Systems Consortium and the STEPS Centre so we can disseminate our findings through websites aimed at specific academic communities. We will work with these partners to organise panels at conferences such as the biennial conferences of the International Health Economics Association and the Global Symposium on Health Systems Research and the annual meeting of the Development Studies Association. We will produce at least six scientific papers for journals such as Health Policy and Planning, Social Science and Medicine and World Development. We will submit at least one summary article to The Lancet or the British Medical Journal to reach the broader health systems research community. We will aim to bring together some of these papers in an edited volume at the end of the project. The working papers and edited volume will be of particular interest to other researchers in the field, but will also be made available to practitioners and decision-makers. The ultimate beneficiaries will be to poor households in terms of access and a better enabling/regulatory environment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>395953</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Development Research Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Production of video clip by IDRC for IDS online self-study module</gtr:description><gtr:id>E0AA7521-987D-4B0F-B175-FDD209E248E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The video clip was produced</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>IDRC made the clip for IDS' online self-study module on mHealth, Health Systems and Development</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>NA</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Johns Hopkins University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Complementary materials offered by Johns Hopkins University for IDS online self-study module</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B13C4CA-7586-44AF-A061-AF6451046857</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outcomes yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>David Bishai of Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health offered complementary teaching materials for IDS' online self-study module on mHealth, Health Systems and Development.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>NA</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation on 'Health information seeking in Bangladesh; How does mHealth fit in?' at mHealth Summit, Washington DC</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B14E6B2D-800D-401C-A710-F0B633FEBA39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We delivered the initial research findings which emphasised the lack of mHealth usage by Bangladeshi households.

The case studies were followed by interactive discussion sessions between the faculties and the participants on relevant equity and accountability aspects of the initiatives. The course was designed to involve the relevant eHealth stakeholders as participants and faculty so eHealth equity and accountability concepts can be worked out by the actual eHealth practitioners and actors. A total of 22 participants from Government of Bangladesh (Directorate General of Health Services and Directorate General of Family Planning), private implementers like DNet, Criticalink, MSH Bangladesh, academic institutions like NIPSOM (National Institute of Preventive and Social Medicine) and BUHS (Bangladesh University of Health Sciences), telecom companies like Robi and research institutes like icddr,b took part in the short course.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Short course - Technical Advisory Groupunder ICT for health group in Bangladesh</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8AD2872D-2B21-4613-9ED4-E07D1442EA23</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This short course in Bangladesh was aimed to provide direction for ICT-related matters in health.

This has had impact at several levels. icddr,b has reached agreement with a digital health company to develop a new intervention aimed at linking informal village doctors to trained doctors through a telemedicine service. This intervention will draw on lessons documented by this study. The Government has decided to establish health advice lines at all health facilities. This is, in part, a response to the findings of this study that individuals prefer to seek advice from facilities and health workers they know. 

At the global level, we brought together social scientists and experts on digital health technologies at a brainstorming meeting in Vancouver. We are finalising a rapid response brief on the need for continued dialogue between these different policy and research communities to formulate more effective strategies for supporting developments in digital health and for reforming regulatory arrangements. We will circulate the briefing widely to both research and policy communities on health system strengthening and digital health. We are also putting together a special issue of a journal on innovation for improved access to health services which will include papers that draw on the study findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6C9B82CC-C5B7-4475-B14A-01F68728264A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Since the project was launched, several systematic reviews of the impact of ICT-enabled health interventions have reported modest impact and very few interventions going to scale. This has generated a debate about the assumptions underlying these investments. The grant has enabled our research team to contribute to this debate. We found a lot of innovative activity on the supply-side, stimulated by grants from challenge funds and bilateral donors, but we found that only a small proportion of the population had changed their health information-seeking behaviour. This was an unexpected finding. We found big gender differences in the use of mobile phones. In some ways the rapid spread of access to mobile phones has reinforced existing gender inequalities since men are more likely to own a phone and they control access to phone time in many households. However, some younger women use access to the internet through mobile phones to find information on sexual and reproductive health that would not otherwise be available. As the cost of smartphones and internet access continues to fall, we anticipate they will be increasingly used to bypass local gatekeepers. 
The study documented the emergence of new knowledge mediators for health information. These are raising critical issues about how people decide which information to trust. Faced with proliferating sources of information, individuals and households often fall back on trusted personal and family networks. A number of factors influence the degree to which individuals trust a source of health information including referral by a trusted person and the experience of initial use. 
Research on mobile phone health services has tended to focus on technical issues and on the design and implementation of public health programmes. The grant has enabled the research team to bring a social science perspective to existing research and intervention networks. Our partner in Bangladesh secured complementary funding from IDRC to bring a health systems perspective to the SEARCH network of mobile health innovators. We have established collaborative links with a network of public health researchers, led from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and also with the Innovation Hub at USAID. We have developed teaching materials, including an online course, which we publicised through a large network of mHealth innovators and which we ran as a pilot blended learning course for learners from all over the world. We are planning to use these materials in a master-level course in Bangladesh.
Our study has identified new research questions concerning the potential for disruption of health systems including: (i) strategies for bundling the use of treatment algorithms, inexpensive diagnostic technologies and easy access to inexpensive drugs into an integrated service; (ii) the challenges in establishing new kinds of partnership between for-profit and not-for-profit information and health organisations and government and (iii) the need for in-depth research to understand more about the sub-populations who are relying on digital health information as contrasted to those who are not; and the implications for poor or marginalised populations.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project was implemented in close consultation with the Bangladesh Ministry of Health. That ministry has announced that it will provide mobile phone consultation services nationally. We anticipate that icddr,b will undertake follow up studies to assess the impact of this new policy. In addition, icddr,b continues to explore partnerships with ICT companies aimed at testing innovative approaches for improving access by the poor to basic health information and services. We will organise two panels on this topic at a conference in Dhaka in September entitled: Bangladesh: Role of Knowledge and Partnership in the Delivery of Development Success. The participants will include government policy-makers, health programme managers and representatives of donor agencies. Our international influencing strategy includes publications in academic journals, including a special issue on innovation, participation in international conferences on development studies and health systems research and encouraging the use of online teaching materials. We will present the findings to a conference on States, Markets and Societies in Brighton in July and to a panel at Health Systems Global in Vancouver in November. We will publicise these meetings through blogs to be posted on the Health Systems Global website and publicised through a large mHealth network and the SEARCH network, supported by IDRC.
