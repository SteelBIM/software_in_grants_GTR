wellbeing of people with dementia</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/M005607/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The LAUGH project builds on the applicant's previous AHRC funded research investigating handcraft, playfulness and wellbeing and OPAN and HEFCW funded research into ageing. The UK Co-I will bring to the project track record of research concerning haptics and dementia and the International Co-I in technology, handcraft and wellbeing. The project will be supported by Wales' National Centre for Product Design and Research, which has extensive experience in design research and product development. This project proposes an investigation into handcraft and playfulness in relation to dementia in order to inform the development of ludic artefacts (age appropriate toys) to support the wellbeing of people with dementia (PwD). The aim is to develop innovative playful devices that amuse, distract, comfort, engage, bring joy, and promote 'in the moment' living. The proposed research is timely as it addresses the call by the World Health Organisation and the G8 Dementia Summit for international collaboration in order to address the global challenge of the ageing population.

Many older people enjoy creative pursuits and leisure activities that involve making and crafting such as knitting, crochet, woodcraft and DIY etc. People with dementia may be able to continue to practice craft skills learnt earlier in life; however memory of the structure and rules of making, reliant on cognitive function, may decline. For example PwD may continue to be able to form the stitches when knitting but can no longer follow a knitting pattern; the rhythms of making, muscle memory and emotional memory systems appear to be retained despite cognitive degeneration. This investigation will examine ways in which hand use, rhythms and gestures found in traditional handcrafting activities can be used to inform the development of playful artefacts. 

The intention will be to design new playful devices to amuse and stimulate people with dementia and bring them joy, fun and laughter. The research will investigate how handcrafting promotes positive emotion; identify the manual skills that are retained despite cognitive decline in PwD and examine the ways in which haptics, gesture and sensory stimulation contribute to subjective wellbeing in later life. Those in the caring professions advocate the use of children's toys and have observed the comfort they bring to people with dementia. However there is an acknowledgment by professionals of the stigma attached to PwD playing with children's toys. This is attributed to a perceived loss of dignity, mainly by relatives and friends, rather than the person with dementia themselves. Findings from the applicant's previous research indicate there is currently a need for age appropriate playful devices specifically designed for people with dementia. This project proposes inclusive participatory design research to inform the development of new kinds of playful devices. These will build bridges between craft and hobby activities that are perceived positively by society and toys that are not. Playful artefacts will be developed to support the wellbeing of those for whom life has become limited due to memory loss or cognitive impairment. 

The research will investigate ways of integrating smart materials and digital technology into designs to supplement physical and material properties. It proposes to explore new ways of augmenting traditional craft activities to provide additional sensory and communication properties. This will make it possible for PwD to interact with the devices either independently or socially and provide opportunities to personalise the experience (for example by including family photographs or favourite music). By integrating electronics and sensors, designs for new types of age appropriate toys will be developed. A toolkit for designing playful devices for PwD will be proposed, based on the findings from the research, in order to inform the design community and care professionals working in the sector</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will enhance the lives of people with dementia, their families and carers and be of benefit to society as a whole. It will investigate playful activities involving hand-use and propose the development of ludic artefacts (age appropriate toys) to promote positive emotion and enhance subjective wellbeing. Impact will be realised within the funding period for those stakeholders participating in the research and over the longer term through dissemination via professional associations, networks, professional development and training. The beneficiaries will include:
- People with dementia
- Families, carers 
- Care professionals: occupational therapists, art and hand therapists, dementia nurses
- NHS medical services: doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists 
- Social Care providers: Local Authorities and not for profit businesses (e.g. - Gwalia Cyf, Community Housing Cymru, REACT, BUPA etc.)
- Charities (e.g. Age UK, Alzheimer's Society, Dementia Positive)

This research will inform policy regarding future care for the ageing population and indicate new priorities for research and innovation. It will propose new non-pharmacological interventions, which will have economic impact by reducing government healthcare spending over the longer term. The international collaboration with FASS at the University of Technology Sydney will provide opportunity for rapid global impact through shared designs, prototypes and findings. The research will help inform and increase the effectiveness of social care policy and foster global economic performance through development of new kinds of products and services over the medium term. Beneficiaries include: 
- International governments
- World Health Organisation
- Commonwealth governments
- UK government departments: policymaking related to healthcare and older people
- Regional government: informing initiatives and policy making e.g. Welsh Assembly Government: Ageing Well in Wales, and the Commissioner for Older People in Wales
- Local government: informing social care provision and services for older people e.g. day centres, residential care, community centres 

The research also has potential to contribute to the UK economy through the development of new designs patents and services. It will propose a toolkit for designing devices for PwD that include the use of smart materials, embedded electronics and new methods of fabrication. The research will be of interest to individuals, organisations and businesses involved in design, engineering, fabrication and materials technology including: 
- Designers
- Technologists
- Materials scientists
- The Design Council 
- British Crafts Council 
- Industry: electronics industry; games and toy manufacturers
- Digital fabricators and mass customisation businesses
- Software manufacturers
- Engineers concerned with hand-use and bimanual coordination
- Assistive technologies and health care product designers and manufacturers: including brain injury, stroke and rehabilitation devices

Insights from the research concerning visual and tactile perception, hand-use, and manipulative skills of PwD will have the potential to inform:
- Development of new products, resources and service design for older people
- Architects: design for housing, public buildings and social care environments
 
CARIAD is committed to placing people at the heart of research and the proposed participatory project will make a difference to the SWB of PwD through their inclusion from the outset. CARIAD will support dissemination events, publication of the toolkit and website providing potential impact to occur rapidly, globally, individually and socially. Research staff will gain new transferable skills in working with new technologies and materials, design processes and requirements for designing for PwD applicable to a range of design contexts and service provision for vulnerable people with complex social needs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>424182</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A range of sensory textile artefacts: five aprons and two blankets made for people with late stage dementia.

The workshop participants included health professionals, charity volunteers and professionals from third sector organisations including Ageing Well in Wales (Welsh Assembly Government), textile artists, designers and researchers. The purpose of the event was to launch the LAUGH project and show its relationship to previous research into sensory textiles for people with late stage dementia. During the day several sensory textile garments were constructed for people with late stage dementia.

Outcomes:
A range of sensory textile garments for people with late stage dementia; these were subsequently refined and developed prior to being handed over to the people they were designed for (November 2015). These garments have had a positive impact on the wellbeing of the recipients and their families as evidenced in face to face recorded evaluation data and personal emails. 

Impact: 
This work has been published in a peer reviewed paper in the journal: Working with Older People (in press, publication due June 2016) and presented at conferences including Design4Health (July 2015) and Dementia Congress (November 2015) where the presentation was delivered to an audience of 50+care professionals, carers and academics.
