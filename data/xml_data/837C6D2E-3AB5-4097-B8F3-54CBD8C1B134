Postgraduate medical assessments now involve an important and well-established focus on effective interaction with patients, often formally assessed as part of various clinical examinations. Through simulated consultations with role-played patients, doctors can be observed in action, enabling examiners to assess not only a candidate's clinical knowledge, but crucially how that knowledge is deployed and communicated with a patient in a spoken context. Nevertheless, the pass rates in many of these exams, particularly higher failure rates for those who have done their initial medical training overseas, have led to concerns that linguistic and cultural factors may play a role in doctors? poorer performance in such consultations.&lt;br />&lt;br />The study here researches these type of assessments with a view to better understanding what is happening, as well as producing training materials to aid exam candidates. A close linguistic analysis is made of video data from assessed, simulated patient surgeries, including the development of an innovative analysis of non-verbal features of communication, in addressing where communicative differences or difficulties might occur. This has implications for further understanding contemporary clinical examinations and the training and preparation postgraduate doctors can undertake.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study has potential for impact in two key arenas. There is first the directly user-related impact on a 'real-world' problem, through the opportunity to contribute to UK General Practice training in a way that fosters multicultural gate-keeping practices. In terms of users, this has ramifications for International Medical Graduates in particular, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) who administer the exam. But the study has a broader secondary impact for a range of fields in medical education and the ongoing dicussion about standard setting within a now globalised medical workforce. 

The impact of addressing the 'real-world' problem of high failure rates for International Medical Graduates in the RCGP Clinical Skills Assessment outlined in detail in 'Pathways to Impact', is perhaps the most important outcome of the project. The production of training material from the study and the liaison work with GP trainers and examiners is an attempt to directly tackle the issue, ultimately helping these particular candidates better understand expectations and mitigate against accusations of an unwritten curriculum. The research document intended for the RCGP will also provide a point of evidenced discussion around the ongoing debate about the Membership examination. 

The user-related impact potential is more broad than only these direct user groups. The issues of disparate pass rates, most especially for International Medical Graduates, is certainly one that the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) have led the way in publishing figures and welcoming research on, but it is by no means the only section of the medical profession where these issues are arising. The qualification criteria and standard setting for medical professionals necessarily takes on new connotations and challenges in the context of a globalised workforce, an international discussion that the UK remains centrally involved in and which this project can contribute to. While the RCGP Membership examination is a qualification for General Practice in the UK only, a highly mobile international population of medical professionals means that candidates will continue to and perhaps increasingly come from a range of educational backgrounds. Defining a standard for interaction in the UK General Practice consultation can therefore become problematic in this globalised context. This is true of course for many other medical qualification exams and indeed the issue of pass rates for International Medical Graduates is broader than just those at the Royal College of General Practitioners, although since not all pass rates are currently published it seems likely to be an even more widespread dilemma. It is important therefore to hold up this research study as a useful means of enquiry into the pass rates of medical gate-keeping examinations that might be applicable in other medical exams, specialisms and Medical Royal Colleges. This will enable the RCGP to maintain their own profile as research leaders in this area.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-10-27</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-28</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>116749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>King's College Health Communication Lab (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4E92E574-20A4-4384-A6BE-779ABAE37506</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A presentation on the research given to medical practitioners and academics within this field, as part of the King's College Health Communication Lab.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/ldc/seminars/healthcommlab.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Association for Simulated Practice in Healthcare (paper presentation)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1B34FDCF-D48C-4E8F-866D-79ED5F9489A7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Assessing our Assessments: A sociolinguistic investigation into communicative issues in simulated consultations'

Testimonial:
&amp;quot;On 25th September, we were fortunate to have Sarah Atkins run a morning for us entitled &amp;quot;Inside the CSA&amp;quot;. This was for a group of 90 trainers with varying levels of experience. Sarah described her research and presented the relevant findings in an interesting and accessible way which gave us all better insight into the issues facing candidates taking the CSA, the complexity of the exam and the subtleties of linguistics in relation to this. As trainers we want to have a variety of ways in which we can help our GPSTs improve their communication skills and succeed in the assessment process. We are already aware of the differential pass rates between UK graduates and those who studied medicine outside the UK, but sometimes the reasons for these differences are unclear. This workshop looked at some real examples, and Sarah shared with us some of the detailed analysis and findings from her research. The feedback showed that attendees found this really helpful in understanding why some trainees struggle, and that understanding is crucial in working out strategies to improve performance, not only in the examination but also in day to day patient interactions. It was enlightening and encouraging to be able to discuss research that has a practical day to day application for trainers especially relating to such an important and contentious area.&amp;quot;

We particularly focus on communication and consultations skills for the workshop training. There are many workshops already in existence for the CSA, but what marked this out a different for participants was that the recommendations were based on the findings of the research project. Participants were able to watch consented videos of real candidates taking the exam and evidence the linguistic strategies and features that help people perform well.

Feedback from the event has been outstanding and metrics from questionnaires are available upon request.

Feedback from participants, who were about to take their Clinical Skills Assessment, suggetsed it was a very useful event which had helped them think about their own consultation skills, as well as prepare for the exam itself.

Dr Atkins has used the research has been used to provide a variety of successful training packages for end-users, particularly GPs. These materials are the first of their kind, employing video clips and using linguistic methods of micro-interactional analysis for practical training, helping GPs unpick effective communication. The educational materials have been delivered through face-to-face workshops to over 250 GPs. The bespoke design renders the workshops popular and feedback has been outstanding (available upon request). 142 of the 150 GP Trainers who participated in the workshops indicated they would be using the materials in teaching, demonstrating the high level of uptake. This is reiterated in testimonials: 

'Sarah described her research and presented the relevant findings in an interesting and accessible wayAs trainers we want to have a variety of ways in which we can help our GPSTs improve their communication skills and succeed in the assessment processThe feedback showed that attendees found this really helpful in understanding why some trainees struggle, and that understanding is crucial in working out strategies to improve performance, not only in the examination but also in day to day patient interactions.'

These materials will have ongoing impact through their delivery within the university's new Linguistic Profiling for Professionals unit. The training materials have also been delivered in the form of a textbook (The RCGP's Insider's Guide to the CSA for MRCGP, released July 2015, selling 393 copies) and e-learning materials, recently made available to every GP trainee in the UK (November 2015), ensuring that they reach as wide an audience as possible.

The wider societal impact of the research has been its substantial contribution to a critical debate on assessing interpersonal skills in medicine, from the unique perspective of linguistically evidenced research findings. A research report, published 2014, has been widely disseminated to medical audiences and reviewed favourably in British Medical Journal Careers section: http://careers.bmj.com/careers/advice/view-article.html?id=20020183. Most recently, Dr Atkins published a debate article in BMC Medical Education, 'Simulated Consultations: A sociolinguistic perspective', which has already been widely read and discussed. In the first week of the article's publication in January 2016, it received 2400 hits and over 200 tweets (http://www.altmetric.com/details/4998895/twitter), ranking it the #1 BMC Medical Education article ever published and in the top 5% of all BioMed articles (http://www.altmetric.com/details/4998895#score). It is having a demonstrable impact on the debate around professional communication in medical education, evident in the online discussions being held through Twitter, medical journalists and bloggers.

Assessment through simulation and the appraisal of interpersonal skills more generally, are complex and controversial topics, which are centrally important to the worldwide debate about standardised models of professional communication in a mobile and diverse global population. Dr Atkins research has been at the forefront of this debate, in an area that will have increasing influence over the next few decades.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>39CE4EB5-7948-4BCA-8B98-3D160F1A3AD3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>An e-learning module was developed for the Royal College of General Practitioners, based upon the findings of the research project.

The analysis conducted during this project has identified key linguistic features associated with successful and unsuccessful performance in the exam. These include communicative features such as how phrases expressing empathy and understanding for the patient are used and how candidates effectively use 'metacommunication' to structure and guide the listener through the 10-minute consultation. 
Educational materials have been developed from the research findings (detailed below). These do, in themselves, represent a methodological advance for the field of applied linguistics. The materials are the first of their kind, using linguistic methods of micro-interactional analysis for practical training. The materials employ video clips, transcripts of spoken interaction and key ideas from linguistics to help GPs analyse how candidates do well in the exam, as well as providing a toolkit for trainees to analyse their own communicative techniques.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that not all of the linguistic features of successful communication in the exam actually reflect the skills needed for real-life clinical practice. Through a careful comparative analysis of the exam with a data-set of real GP consultations, it is possible to identify linguistic features that may be more indicative of the simulated setting than they are of effective clinical practice. These findings have implications for the ubiquitous use of simulation for training and assessment in medicine, particularly in pinpointing the limitations of simulation in assessing professional competence. An article was recently published in the journal BMC Medical Education, 'Simulated consultations: A sociolinguistic perspective', with two more articles currently under review, which summarise these findings and have contributed to initiating a debate in medical education about the most reliable means of assessing communication skills.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings have been useful in developing training materials for GP trainees and trainers.
