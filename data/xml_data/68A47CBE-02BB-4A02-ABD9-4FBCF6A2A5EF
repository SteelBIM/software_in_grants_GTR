The emerging field of Chemical Cybernetics aims to build upon existing expertise in chemical robotics, complex networks, supramolecular self-assembly and automation, combined with newly available state-of-the-art chromatographic and mass spectrometric techniques to drive feedback control and artificial intelligence in complex chemical systems. The equipment requested in this proposal will allow the construction of a truly unique platform where advanced spectrometric techniques, usually only seen in metabolomics, are applied to chemical problems of low-abundance analyte identification and differentiation of complex mixtures over a broad spectrum of research, from optimisation of automated synthesis for a 'dial-a-molecule' devices to sequence specification in origins of life research to manufacturing and chemical discovery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We aim to enable our advanced mass spec kit for chemical robotic control to be adopted not only by other researchers and academics, but to transform the current world of chemistry by embracing digital technology and our developments in configurable chemical-robotic platforms for the discovery, optimisation, scale-up and control of chemistry. The outputs which will be made possible by the new platform will create also impacts in advanced proteomics, biopharma and metabolomics applications, including quantitation using isobaric tags, low level PTM analysis, data independent acquisition (DIA), and top down proteomics.

The Cronin group is also engaged with a number of industrial collaborators through our EPSRC programme grant and we will use these collaborations to help explore the use of the new kit and the robotic interface to problems set by our industrial collaborators.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>789800</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Programmable Molecular Metal Oxides (PMMOs): From Fundamentals to Application</gtr:description><gtr:id>6295FD4E-67B0-4218-B88F-52770640C614</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All publications tagged to EP/J015156/1</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>as above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Metal oxide based technology is worth over a trillion dollars per year with applications in microchips, hard disks, displays, glass coatings, sun screen, chemical catalysts, and superconductors. In almost all instances the metal oxide based materials are comprised of 'solid-state' infinite materials which require high temperature processing and can be difficult to modify systematically. We have been working on a class of molecular metal oxides called polyoxometalates (POMs). Research in molecular metal oxides or polyoxometalate clusters (POMs) provides an unrivalled structural diversity of molecules, displaying a wide range of properties. During the past 5 years we have transformed the area demonstrating how to control the assembly of the clusters, including the precise design of host-guest systems that are intrinsically electronically active. Now, due to our researcher critical mass and expertise, and state of the art single crystal X-ray diffraction using microsource and area detectors, cryospray and ion mobility mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, flow systems, microsystems, and electrochemical measurements we are the leading group worldwide capable of developing designed approaches to producing clusters and building blocks that can link the molecular with the nanoscale, microscale and device / system level using a programmable approach in the following areas: (i) electronic materials; (ii) hybrid organic inorganic molecules and materials; (iii) emergent materials and structures; (iv) continuous flow discovery, processing and scale up nanoscale clusters. Platform funding will allow us to maintain critical mass, embark on risky cross-cutting projects that are not normally possible using responsive mode funding, allow continuity. These aspects are particularly important here since during the last few years the group has demonstrated a unique research philosophy developing new synthetic areas, fundamental ideas, techniques, and unique research approaches including embracing important disciplines needed to advance the chemical research (e.g. chemical engineering, optical physics, electrical engineering and so on). Although these projects are highly focussed on specific areas, the group has become highly integrated and more successful as a result of this integration but there is a limit to which individual projects can be used to integrate the group. The key aspect of the Platform grant will be the additional integration, adding value way beyond what would be possible through standard responsive mode funding of smaller grants, as well as helping a highly integrated and large research group funded by many different grants remain integrated, responsive, and dynamic. We will also use the Platform mechanism to develop the people funded within the group encouraging them to think critically, develop independence, a new ideas and approaches that exploit the unique mix of projects, expertise developing their careers as academics, industrialists and experts able to link fundamental with applied aspects.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Energy and the Physical Sciences: Hydrogen Production using a Proton Electron Buffer</gtr:description><gtr:id>BA1B96DE-A31C-4DBC-BF27-00AE334FDD12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publications are tagged to: EP/K023004/1</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>As above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We propose to develop 'proton-electron-buffers' (PEBs) using redox-active polyoxometalate (POM) clusters that will be able, for the first time, to address the problem of simultaneous oxygen and hydrogen production during the electrolysis of water. It is anticipated that the use of a PEB in the water-splitting reaction will allow new catalysts, electrodes, and device architectures to be employed in electrolysers, and we will investigate both these new designs and the use of PEBs with exisiting electrolyser technology. Using a PEB in an electrolyser could also bring significant advantages with regards to intermittent power supplies (such as renewables) by reducing the instantaneous voltages required for electrolysis to occur. There could also be significant advantages In addition to exploring water splitting through the paradigm of the proton-electron-buffer, we will also explore the use of reduced polyoxometalate clusters as an intermediate &amp;quot;fuel source&amp;quot;, by reacting the reduced PEBs with reducible chemical substrates to produce storable fuels. Thus this work could pave the way to a totally new route to 'clean' low-carbon H2 production temporally separated from the production of oxygen, as well as reducing energy consumption through technological advances informed by a whole system understanding as highlighted by the RCUK Energy Programme.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/P00153X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>863FC58A-7217-42EA-B076-663F2D770BB8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>75</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical measurement</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6BF947B0-8E6E-48DB-AB68-7130938F2DF2</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrument. sensor &amp; detectors</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>98EA7556-1427-44F9-84F3-BF99B7207302</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>40</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Analytical Science</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>1820CCC5-B4C4-47E9-B81F-8F49AC606F0E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>35</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Chemical Structure</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F78E4567-DD59-4364-9D1F-0A778996E941</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Instrumentation Eng. &amp; Dev.</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
