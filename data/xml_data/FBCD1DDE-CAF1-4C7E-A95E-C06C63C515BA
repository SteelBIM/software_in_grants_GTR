With the increasing prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases, there is an emerging market for functional food; however, few products exist which exploit the naturally beneficial properties of pulses. This project builds on new research showing that a novel method of processing pulses results in a versatile food ingredient with enhanced nutritional properties. The focus of this project is to develop a pilot-scale process for the industrial manufacture of this unique ingredient, and subsequently evaluating the feasibility and capacity to incorporate this ingredient into a range of food products. Ultimately, this project could lead to the development of a new generation of functional foods, suitable for the general public, but specifically designed to deliver slow-release energy and prebiotic effects.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-05-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>162634</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our research findings have shown that the novel food ingredient can be scaled up on an industrial scale without losing desirable nutritional properties (e.g. retention of functional dietary fibre). Also, we have demonstrated that the ingredient can be successfully into selected sweet and savoury food products. One economic benefit of this food ingredient would be its commercial impact, notable in the agricultural, food and healthcare sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>35B9A6A1-0A71-4B15-8CE1-8E96BA95C257</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>One important finding of this project is that the novel food ingredient can be manufactured on an industrial scale while still retaining desirable nutritional properties (e.g. functional dietary fibre). Manufacturing the ingredient on a large scale also enabled us to produce enough ingredient for early 'baking trials'. In these trials, the ingredient was incorporated at relatively high doses into sweet and savoury products, and shown to have have desirable sensory characteristics. 

Overall, the outcome of the final dissemination and evaluation meeting was that there was still a clear commercialisation potential for this ingredient and that some further work would be needed to finalise the translation of this research. Independent IP solicitors have also confirmed that the ingredient is novel and inventive, and we are working to prepare a patent for protection of the ingredient and the process by which it is produced.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The novel food ingredient produced on an industrial scale has retained nutritional properties originally observed in the laboratory. The product has potential use as an ingredient in a range of foods and would be of interest to a number of sectors but particularly the agriculture, food and healthcare sectors. Further work is needed to assess the nutritional properties and chemical and physical characteristics of this ingredient, on its own and in range of foods, when processed under a broader range of commercial processing conditions. To achieve this, we have submitted a Super Follow-on funding application to the BBSRC.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D22ED11A-37D4-49FF-AC23-C7423082FC85</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/M021076/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
