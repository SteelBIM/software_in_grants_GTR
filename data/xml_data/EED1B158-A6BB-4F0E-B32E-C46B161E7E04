War</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008297/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Gateways consists of Kent, Brighton, Greenwich and Portsmouth HEIs together with an extensive range of collaborators and will provide a gateway for wide public access to: 1) a network of research excellence in First World War Studies 2) skills and resources to develop a range of outputs 3) the geographical gateway to the Western Front and wider war. 

Through Gateways the British public will be given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions. Gateways will use the combination of its recognised research strengths and high profile in First World War Studies, practitioner skills, resources and geography to explore themes universal to the experience of the First World War:
 
The global nature of the conflict.
The importance of the sea and overseas communications.
The blurred line between fighting and home fronts; how people understood the nature of the conflict and the acts of combat.
The effect of transplanting communities and creating new ones.
Moments of culture clash and moments of culture harmony.
How different memories and legacies emerged from the conflict, why some endured, mutated or were marginalised. 


Gateways has three elements: 
1) Core members: building on the existing research interests and public engagement links centred on the First World War anniversaries between Brighton, Greenwich, Kent and Portsmouth HEIs. For example, Kent and Portsmouth are developing a research network exploring the experience of Imperial port cities during the conflict in association with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies; Greenwich and Kent are working on a programme for schools and colleges; Brighton and Portsmouth have collaborated on a photographic project with the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
2) Project collaborators: extending and exploiting existing partnerships with non-HEI bodies for the benefit of the wider community. Examples include: Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Hampshire County Council, Kent County Council, Maidstone Museum, Marlowe Theatre (Canterbury), National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library and Archive (hereafter REMLA), Screen South, War Memorials Trust.
3) Network members: drawing in other academics from a wide range of disciplines with expertise relevant to the objectives of Gateways. For a list of key network members see pp6-7.

Gateways is geographically based in a region that has a unique historical status:
SE England was the Gateway to the Western Front and was the hinge on which the British war effort hung. Its ports of Southampton, Newhaven, Folkestone, Dover and the naval bases of Chatham and Portsmouth were the nodal points.
The region was a militarised zone covered with defence lines and fortifications including the British army's main base at Aldershot. It was a liminal space between fighting and home fronts; a cultural and racial melting pot containing imperial contingents (Africans, Canadians, Indians and West Indians), Chinese Labour Corps camps and large numbers of Belgian refugees.
The region became the home of vast hospital encampments which further ensured that the presence of the war and its effects remained constant.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Gateways to the First World War will make a considerable impact based on its core overarching aims: 

That the British public is given the opportunity to engage with, understand and interpret a historical event that played a fundamental role in the shaping of the contemporary world and their place within it. In exploring the local, wherever located, they will engage with the global. They will also engage with their own preconceptions and be encouraged to test and question their origins. Gateways will then use this as a base to examine the (dis)connection between academic/official history and popular perceptions. 
 
It will use a broad range of platforms and partnerships to ensure that its events and resources are disseminated and achieve a high profile including a purpose-built website, use of social media, programmes with schools, colleges, museums, archive centres, galleries and international collaborators.

Local communities and the wider public in general
As noted above, connection with communities is the key to Gateways' plan. It will provide a wide-range of people with the skills and confidence to engage with academic research according to their own interests, develop new partnership and community links and inspire a lasting legacy. 

The Third Sector
Gateways will enhance relationships with existing partners still further and pioneer new links. It will demonstrate fully that both HEIs and the third sector can interact fruitfully to mutual benefit which then also enhances the lives of the wider public. Examples of existing partnerships include:
Museums, galleries and archives: Brighton Pavilion and Museums, Chatham Dockyard Museum, Cognitive Media, Kent County Council Archives, Libraries and Museums, Maidstone Museum, National Maritime Museum, Portsmouth City Museums, Royal Engineers Museum, Library, Screen South. Of great interest is the ability to interact with the Flanders Field Museum, Ieper/Ypres due to the research overlaps enhanced by geographical proximity which will mean an Impact beyond the UK.
Key First World War-interest groups and organisations: War Memorials Trust, Western Front Association.
The initial mechanism for harnessing the links will be the series of public engagement open days and follow-up events planned by Gateways. These will pave the way for further collaborative involvement in Connected Communities and Translating Cultures research applications particularly designed to investigate reactions to the centenary events and ensure comparative studies beyond the UK 

The media

Gateways members are already engaging with the media on the First World War centenary at a local, national and international level. Three network members took part in the AHRC-BBC national seminar and two have been selected in the recent AHRC-BBC scheme. The centre's commitment to a comprehensive public engagement process which brings together and effectively harnesses cutting edge research with community interest will ensure a high and regular profile for the centre in the media. Further, the research interests of Gateways very much overlap with areas of media engagement. The communications offices of all Gateways institutions are aware of the significance of the anniversary and are committed to ensuring that the research expertise of its members is highlighted.

Policy-makers, governments and public sector agencies
Gateways will provide a flagship case study for the UK government and public sector agencies on large-scale academic-community involvement which can be drawn upon to inform approaches to similar high-profile events such as the forthcoming Second World War (75th) anniversary cycle. Gateways' experiences will be of value to: the Departments of Education; Culture, Media and Sport; English Heritage (and its pan-UK equivalents). Gateways will establish points of contact with these agencies and provide six-monthly reports on its experiences.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>597162</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An exhibition written by Professor Mark Connelly exploring the history of the Indian Army in the First World War.

This permitted many of them to carry out their own research, which led to the creation of two exhibitions.

Artist and curator Patricia Wilson Smith worked with the students to enable them to develop ways of showcasing their research effectively. Together they devised a narrative framework to tell Canterbury's wartime story, selected the materials and formulated their presentation. This culminated in two public exhibitions- one at the Gulbenkian Theatre, the other at The Beaney Institute, Canterbury.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A956A783-8DC9-400A-9DFD-B3D74516F099</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The project allowed the students to gain knowledge of local history and heritage and to develop presentational, exhibition and research skills. As public exhibitions, they also provided a different perspective of the war for local people in Canterbury.

The sessions which took place in late 2013 and the first half of 2014 have meant that both schools are carrying out their own projects during the 2014-15 academic year, with the support of the research centre, and will form part of an Extended Project Qualification for the students involved.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>First World War Exhibition with Simon Langton Grammar Schools, Canterbury (William Butler - Research Network)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/projects/canterbury-in-ww1</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This exhibition by Dr Emma Hanna explores the role of cinema during the First World War, both at home and at the Front.

The main output will be an exhibition available on a bilingual basis (French-English) which will be mobile and travel to a number of places over time. Throughout the project, the team is also managing a blog (hosted in the Lyc&amp;eacute;e's website) where pupils either transcribe or describe interesting stories that they have found in the archives. It is hoped that Grayson and Faucher will present the initial findings of the project at Home Front during the First World War conference organised at the National Archives in September 2016. This three-day conference specifically targets community projects and researchers. Once the project is completed, Grayson and Faucher will write up an article to be submitted to a leading historical journal with the aim to further elaborate on the pupils' research and publicise the project to the academic community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This transdisciplinary project aims to uncover the lives of Francophones in London during the First World War, more specifically in 1916, studying both the refugees but also permanently settled communities in the capital, and the interactions between these two separate groups and the British.

5) Co-authored (Bassett &amp;amp; Beaven) article for International Journal of Maritime History.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This Project investigates the impact of the Battle of Jutland on British society through identifying the communities of the 6,100 sailors who lost their lives in the conflict. It has been traditionally assumed that most naval sailors were enlisted from seafaring communities since the navy recruited sailors directly from their base ports rather than establish recruiting centres in the UK's major cities (as was the tradition in the Royal Marines). The project will test this theory by mapping the 6,100 sailors killed in Jutland and assess whether certain communities suffered disproportionally from others.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research project led by Dr Brad Beaven (University of Portsmouth) in collaboration with the Portsdown University of the Third Age.

Those planned are:

Academic Outcomes
- Journal article targeted at the Journal of Transport History. The subject matter will reflect the results of the archival investigation and reflect how WW1 shaped the workplace and the production of engineering products within Thornycroft.
- This project offers the opportunity to develop a case study that explores the impact of WW1 on Thornycroft as a business. 
- The opportunity to work with museums and archives enhancing the engagement skills of the academic partner through having to present work within a different context, namely a museum/archive display. 

Community Partner Outcomes 
- Increased awareness and understanding of the Thornycroft collections amongst staff, volunteers, researchers, special interest groups, visitors to the museums, online visitors and event participants
- Increase in visits to the Thornycroft Gallery at Milestones and events stimulated by project
- Increase in volunteer numbers and volunteer hours directed towards Thornycroft collections
- Increase in use of online resources relating to Thornycroft and Hampshire's industrial history
- Increase in visits to the archives in Winchester and Southampton
- Increased engagement with the local University and appreciation of the wider academic debates that will be informed by the collections.


Wider Community Outcomes
- Greater knowledge and skills in research and collections management developed amongst collections volunteers through the workshop and regular meetings.
- Greater knowledge and interest in Thornycroft and Hampshire's industrial history amongst general public and special interest groups
- Increase in engagement between museums and archives and family historians, local clubs and societies
- Educational audiences through University outreach activity and input into Business History education within the University through lectures to educational establishments.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This project seeks to develop public understanding of and engagement with Hampshire's industrial history using archives from the Thornycroft collection in the care of Hampshire Cultural Trust and Archives held by Southampton City Council Arts and Heritage, both of whom are Community Partners in this project. 

It will inform the themes of life on the home front as experienced by the workforce and managers of John Thornycroft Ltd. As the company was engaged in the production of vehicles and ships, this will also contribute to our understanding of how war production was organised. 

This research will be used as a basis for enhancing the contextualisation and interpretation of the Thornycroft Collections held by the two community partners. Members of the public will benefit from improved interpretation in the gallery devoted to Thornycroft and in the street scenes at Milestone Museum in Basingstoke. There will also be new online resources, talks and a workshop. Volunteers will have the opportunity to acquire new knowledge and skills whilst supporting the cataloguing and management of the archive collection held by both partners. Volunteers with accounting, legal and/or business skills will be made aware of how their expertise can inform historical analysis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research project led by Dr Roy Edwards (University of Southampton) in collaboration with Hampshire Cultural Trust and Southampton City Council, Arts and Heritage.

Edie's War Research Fund project: Workshop, The National Archives, London, 14 Nov 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This project is undertaking research into First World War nursing, resulting in complementary academic and creative outputs. First, it feeds into Alison Fell's and Christine Hallett's (both network members) ongoing research into WW1 nursing memoirs; second, it will turn Sister Edie Appleton's published diaries 'Nurse At The Front' into a well-researched and innovative theatrical production.

The project has so far:

1. Held a successful event in the National Archives (Dec 2015), Kew, involving a diverse audience and involving Alison Fell, Christine Hallett as speakers, as well as an archivist from the Royal College of Nursing, and a reading of Edie's diaries. Other events involving students are in preparation and will take place later in 2016.
2. Christine Hallett and Alison Fell have so far attended 4 meetings with the creative team, introducing archival materials, answering questions about historical context of the diaries, and finally commenting on drafts of the script. The draft script is now complete. 
3. We have sourced relevant WW1 nursing materials, including annotated reading lists, introductions to relevant databases and archival holdings, and other nurses' diaries. These will feed into the HLF bid in preparation, and will form the basis of the educational package. 
4.

Planned outcomes and outputs are:

1. Study weekend for the general public. See project plan. 

2. In cooperation with local partners production of information materials for the general public: a website, an app for iPhone/Android based on the 3D modelling currently produced by the RCAHMS, and printed information materials. Concrete input from academics' expertise will, for example, include maps and pictures of camps in Britain and the Empire, and repository information on sources which are not held locally. In this, Manz has already advised Historic Scotland and the Royal Commission. The website will be more comprehensive and interpretive than the only one which exists at the moment (http://stobs-camp.bizhat.com/). The electronic materials will be developed with input from media students at Hawick High School. They will constitute accessible teaching resources to teach First World War history in local schools. 

3. Extended press engagement through PR-agency 

4. Academic outputs by Manz, all informed by interaction with the general public and with due acknowledgement: 
- comparative article on Stobs and Knockaloe for Immigrants and Minorities. Special issue on internment, edited by Panikos Panayi and Zoe Denness; proposal to be submitted by July 2015; write-up during grant period
- article for Scottish Historical Review on Stobs within the context of imperial internment structures
-two papers and one workshop at Brigham Young University and Utah State University
-chapter on colonial residents deported to Stobs in co-authored monograph, with Panikos Panayi: Interning 'enemy aliens' in the British Empire during the First World War. First positive reactions on draft proposal from Cambridge University Press series editors (Publications of the German Historical Institute Washington). Publication of this output will be after the end of the project period. 

6. Follow-on funding application to be led by community partners with advice from participating academics.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The two main aims of the project are, first, to contribute to memorialisation of the Stobs Camp as a site of mass internment in the Scottish Borders region during the First World War. Second, to embed its global implications both within regional memorialisation and academic scholarship. Residents of the Scottish Borders Region will gain a new understanding of their place in World War I history within a global context. To achieve these aims, a number of initiatives are planned. These include a study weekend for the general public, academic input into local information materials, and a number of academic outputs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a research project led by Dr Stefan Manz (Aston University) in collaboration with the Scottish Borders Council's Heritage Hub.

There was a wide ranging interaction between the academics and the students: the participants expressed different research interests and were encouraged to follow these up when possible. Interests included: British press perception of refugees, the use of Francophone advertisements in London-based newspapers and the experiences of refugee children. 
NewVIc students also took the opportunity to ask Charlotte Faucher about studying at university, university teaching and application process as they knew she was lecturing at Queen Mary.
The visits led to an exhibition (reported separately).
The participants have gained better insights into the making and practice of history. They used archive materials and understand the challenges of research. Much of our discussion focused on Belgian (and to a lesser extent French) refugees in Britain and this had two consequences: 
? To challenge the frequent historical domination of the French population over the Belgian people
? To add to the historical knowledge of the participants as few of them were aware of the refugee crisis which struck Britain during the First World War.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ww1francophonesinlondon.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Gallipoli talk at University of Southampton-Museum of the Royal Navy study day (Mark Connelly)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A9CA6FA6-51A2-473E-A519-EACE50C85BA2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A talk at the University of Southampton-Museum of the Royal Navy study day on the Gallipoli centenary: 'Tell England (19319): the Gallipoli camaign, the public school ethos and the cinema'.

They were introduced to the value of research about the war and what Research Centres could offer, and encouraged to think more widely about their own research. Participants had one on one support meetings with academics. 

HLF were very pleased with our contribution and were keen for a repeat. Dr Sam Carroll followed up the event with emails to all the attendees and had responses from the following:

Western Kurdistan Association
Project development advice and letter of support. Gateways have offered ongoing guidance and have secured support from Dr Djene Bajalan, who is based at The American University of Iraq in Sulaimani and an expert in this field of interest. Dr Bajalan has agreed to provide the project with research and historical advice when required.

Independent researcher
He had some wonderful FWW photos and memorabilia, but as an independent researcher he didn't have any means to apply to HLF. Sam advised him to contact Surrey Remembers and offer his resources to them.

Step Short
Sam met with a project representative and discussed the project in development which centres on collecting stories and creating a tapestry about the FWW in Folkestone. He will be back in touch when he has tightened the project application.

Tower Hamlets Library
Email exchange re planned HLF application for a project focusing on childhood and air raids, specifically 1917 and Upper North Street School in the Borough

Third Sector Media
Harwich project- ongoing research advice and project consultations. They are putting a large HLF bid together.

Iranian Association
Putting together project plans around Iran/Persia and the FWW. They will get back to us when they have tightened their ideas.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/events/discovering-first-world-war-event-heritage-lottery-fund</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Somme Centenary Field 'researching your family's history of the FWW' (Dr Lucy Noakes) July 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E85D9AA3-A6DC-4911-A12D-7453382AC352</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose was to share information.

Dr Carroll organised and chaired this event which was hosted by Gateways as support for Zap arts and Insite Theatre's FWW project on Conscientious Objection. Dr Carroll introduced Gateways and explained the support we offer, before introducing each speaker in turn. We recruited three speakers for this seminar. Jenny Flood (Project Officer, Newhaven's War, HLF funded project), Dr Chris Kempshall (Project Officer for East Sussex County Council's First World War Centenary Project) and The Revd. Dr Clive Barrett (Author of Subversive Peacemakers - War Resistance 1914-1918: An Anglican Perspective, chair of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship and the Peace Museum in Bradford). Dr Carroll chaired a Q and A afterwards which was a lively discussion about Conscientious Objection in the FWW and also about FWW project development. The seminar was followed by a performance of Sara Clifford's play &amp;quot;The Tribunal&amp;quot;.
Following this event Dr Carroll had two discussions with community partners who were interested in developing FWW projects with the aim of applying for HLF funding.

Following the press release, the Project Leader has been involved in discussions with local businesses and the tourist office to use the project to develop further relations with the local community.

The press article enabled the project to initiate a number of plans with community partners:

1) Community Day for a local volunteer group
2) A film event at the local cinema
3) Schools events

The project has used the initial contact developed from the article to develop the three activities outlined above.

The objective of the session was to enable students to build a history of their school in the war, which we will work with them to put on the project website, to develop a report on their work and to design a small exhibition.

Following the session, the school's teacher declared their commitment to the project and the team will work with the school to develop a programme of engagement and a dissemination event with the school regarding the history of former pupils in the war. An activity which they would not have been able to do otherwise.

The teacher reported to us:

The event included stalls and / or presentations from 11 community groups and heritage organisations. 

There was a range of round table discussions between all attendees, which included speakers centre staff and FWW HLF applicants at enquiry, development and award stages. The questions discussed were:

- What are the main challenges when developing an HLF project application and what solutions can you suggest?
- What networks are available that will be of assistance to developing projects?
- What local FWW histories are under-researched, hidden or silenced?
- How can we ensure that FWW projects appeal to a broad range of participants and audiences?
- What can the engagement centres do to add value to your project?
- What barriers do community projects encounter in practice and how can these be overcome? 

The event also included a digitisation workshop from the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis. A report on this aspect can be found here: http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/News/#d.en.525612

17 out of the 31 attendees who provided feedback reported that the networking opportunities were the most valuable aspect of the event. This has been taken on board by the engagement centres when planning future events.

The event enabled relationships to be strengthened between the individual engagement centres and with partners such as the FWW Centenary Partnership, HLF and Historypin.

One attendee brought along an original album and Gateways' Professor Alison Fell was able to conduct further research and provide insights into the history of the photographs: http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/news/history/mystery-first-world-war-cheshire-10397663

These workshops were designed as to engage the public in the topics of Adult Education and the Great War, which by the time of the Leeds workshop had evolved into a focus on the WEA and the campaign to abolish Child Labour in the Great War.

Professor Fell ran a workshop looking at material from our WW1 collections with pupils from 6 primary schools in Sheffield, plus their teachers and several parents/carers who were also invited. This resulted in the children finding out more about WW1, visiting a university &amp;amp; some archives, their parents being more engaged with the schools (this was one of the outputs of the HLF project as there was a low level of parental engagement in some of the schools).

There was some excellent feedback from the schools about what the pupils, teachers and parents/carers had got out of the sessions.

Small group discussions also gave people the chance to network and share advice.

Following the event each person who attended was contacted and offered further advice in project development. Four projects in particular have continued discussions with Gateways regarding project support and two of these so far have been awarded funding:

A series of research days at the British Library with 2 participants each time. Participants were trained in accessing and using the BL manuscripts collection of FWW plays. They spent the day researching and recording information on plays produced during FWW. Extensive discussion of theatrical production during FWW, the impact of censorship, and the type of theatre being produced. Participants gained skills in using digital research tools and undertaking primary research in archives. 
Following the research days 17 participants requested to undertake further research in their own time. Many participants also contributed valuable skills and knowledge, and suggested avenues for development. This led to the development of a community group on the subject and the application to the Community group funding. From this project and the learning gained there are now 60 confirmed participants (to date) for the second phase of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interpretation, sharing and showcasing of digital storytelling: First World War projects.

Many members of the audience are considering developing submissions to the HLF for First World War related projects, so there was enthusiastic engagement and interest, with wide ranging questions.

The event was aimed at community and other groups with an interest in First World War history, or who were already working on a project investigating the history of their community in the First World War. The aim was both to introduce them to Gateways, to stimulate their research ideas via presentations by historians, by the HLF and by representatives of groups who have been awarded HLF funding for First World War projects, and thus to encourage them to work with Gateways to develop projects and apply to the HLF. 

Promising discussions developed in particular regarding bids to the HLF from community researchers based in Eastleigh and Bramber/Beeding. These will be followed up by the Co I and Community Historian, both of whom were present.

As part of the 'Gateways'-project I also organised a consultation trip with Shona Sinclair (Director Hawick Museum) and Dianne Swift (development officer Archeology Scotland) to the Isle of Man to meet curators and archivists there. This was in preparation for the HLF-bids, which were led by Swift.

Professor Fell ran a workshop looking at material from our WW1 collections with pupils from 6 primary schools in Sheffield, plus their teachers and several parents/carers who were also invited. This resulted in the children finding out more about WW1, visiting a university &amp;amp; some archives, their parents being more engaged with the schools (this was one of the outputs of the HLF project as there was a low level of parental engagement in some of the schools).
There was some excellent feedback from the schools about what the pupils, teachers and parents/carers had got out of the sessions.

The event included stalls and / or presentations from 7 community groups and heritage organisations. 

There was a range of round table discussions between all attendees, which included speakers centre staff and FWW HLF applicants at enquiry, development and award stages. The questions discussed were:

- What are the main challenges when developing an HLF project application and what solutions can you suggest?
- What networks are available that will be of assistance to developing projects?
- What local FWW histories are under-researched, hidden or silenced?
- How can we ensure that FWW projects appeal to a broad range of participants and audiences?
- What can the engagement centres do to add value to your project?
- What barriers do community projects encounter in practice and how can these be overcome? 

The event also included a digitisation workshop from the Centre for Data Digitisation and Analysis. A report on this aspect can be found here: http://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/CentreforDataDigitisationandAnalysis/News/#d.en.525612 

17 out of the 31 attendees who provided feedback reported that the networking opportunities were the most valuable aspect of the event. This has been taken on board by the engagement centres when planning future events.

The event enabled relationships to be strengthened between the individual engagement centres and with partners such as the FWW Centenary Partnership, HLF and Historypin.

A conversation with a community group leader developing a project on the experiences of enemy aliens during the First World War has led to plans for a collaborative event organised by Gateways to the First World War and the Hidden Histories engagement centre for an event in 2016 bringing together similar projects to showcase their research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ww1engage.org.uk/633/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Leeds Museums and Galleries Black History Month WW1 day (Alison Fell) 21 October 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1A573BC2-9D0E-4DF0-B13C-50D628ABF182</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The intended purpose was to share information and to stimulate thinking.

The museum exhibition offered a chance for both local visitors and tourists to reflect on the history of the war in Chichester. It demonstrated the significance of remembering the war at a local level.
Following the exhibition, the relationship between the university and the museum has strengthened and the museum is keen to host another exhibition/community project in the future.

Professor Fell advised the members of the Preservative Party re the part of their exhibition on women and war, including hosting them at the university, finding appropriate items from our collections (which were then lent to the exhibition), and answering several emails from the young curators. 
She also chaired a Q&amp;amp;A of FWW experts answering questions posed by the public as part of a FWW discovery day organised by the museum in relation to their exhibition and she gave a talk as part of a series of related activities on WW1 women strikers. 
These activities added value and historical depth/accuracy to the exhibition, and engaged a range of audiences in WW1 history.

During the event, discussions began with Yvonne Cresswell (Manx National Heritage) regarding the development of an HLF bid, bringing together projects across the country working on internment. This was, in part inspired by the inclusion in the event of a talk from the HLF-funded community 'Little Germany' project by Eastside Community Heritage.

Discussions also took place with Dr Matthew Stibbe about developing a community-focused event in conjunction with Sheffield Hallam University for 2016.

On 31 March we received an email from an attendee at the event who was preparing a talk on women in the First World War for local groups and history societies. The event had inspired her to think beyond British experiences and we advised her on sources for further research.


During the event, discussions began with Yvonne Cresswell (Manx National Heritage) regarding the development of an HLF bid, bringing together projects across the country working on internment. This was, in part inspired by the inclusion in the event of a talk from the HLF-funded community 'Little Germany' project by Eastside Community Heritage.

The project was launched with an event in June 2015 to introduce it to local school teachers, which included a lecture from Mark Connelly entitled &amp;quot;Rebuilding Ypres: the people come home?&amp;quot;

The talk prompted a number of questions, particularly from teachers from disciplines other than History.

Professor Fell delivered an interactive session on WW1 nursing as part of a 1 day study day organised by Leeds City Museum. As a result, she introduced members of the public to new sources (such as the digitized Red Cross WW1 records), and helped people from various different projects by outlining the broader context and making suggestions for further research. It was also an opportunity to network with other people's projects, some of whom followed up with further email contact.

After discussions with Peter, I've offered to do a session on different ways in which FWW deaths were commemorated - different kinds of memorials - personal, local, national etc - and look at some mourning artefacts we have in the Liddle collection. This will happen in March 2016. This will stimulate the artist/songwriter, and act as a framework for some of the other outputs attached to the HLF project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Edie's War Research Fund project: Meetings with creative team</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43E7C8E8-CDFE-4D2C-9F69-2962B0914752</gtr:id><gtr:impact>3 Meetings with creative team (writer, director, designer and producer) for forthcoming play 'Edie's War'. 

We discussed various aspects of the script based on a nurse's WW1 diaries. I provided context, similar examples, answered questions, discussed various possibilities of dramatizing the diaries, suggested what was authentic and what was less likely in terms of fictionalized aspects. 

My input has shaped the play, that will in turn shape audiences' understanding of WW1 nursing. We are having a full workshop with actors, musicians and the rest of the creative team later this year, and the play will be put on in 2017 or 2018 depending on venues/funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/projects/edies-war</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Attended and addressed Marlowe Theatre community theatre project focused on the Armistice commemorations in 2018.

The centre has worked with projects exploring a range of subjects from the experiences of Indian soldiers to the history of zeppelin raids on the home front, and from rehabilitation of soldiers through sport to the surrender of the German naval fleet. Outputs have included films, performances, exhibitions, apps, archival and online resource training, events and community workshops. Details of these outputs can be found in the Engagement Activities &amp;amp; Artistic &amp;amp; Creative Products sections.

The Gateways team has worked with a number of groups developing applications to the Heritage Lottery Fund, offering academic guidance and advice on project development. The work carried out has culminated in sixteen successful applications to the HLF, with twenty further applications currently in development. The centre has also provided support for projects which have already been awarded funding from HLF by providing academic talks, training, advice, volunteer recruitment, and support for events and publicity.

The centre has run a programme of high-quality events, organised in a variety of locations. These have involved: sharing the latest academic research on the First World War to enrich and inspire existing and developing projects; workshops and training; showcasing of HLF projects; networking opportunities. Further details of events have been submitted in the Engagement Activities section.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>36796819-2E0B-43AF-9CDF-35F6A90D0D9F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have moved into Phase 2 of the award. The interim reports can be found via the AHRC and the application for Phase 2 also includes the summary of how the future programme (2017-19) has built on the experiences of Phase 1.

Below are some extracts from that application which summarise the position:

Since its launch in 2014 Gateways to the First World War has encouraged community groups and members of the public to broaden their research by asking new questions, connecting with diverse communities and creating imaginative outputs (see interim report for details). The aim outlined in the original funding application, of encouraging people to 'engage with their own preconceptions andtest and question their origins', has remained central to the ethos of the centre. The centre is, and will remain, firmly rooted in its internationally-recognised research into the history of the conflict and its legacy. Gateways will continue to offer this resource to all centres and, specifically, will offer leadership in particular themes (see 2 below).
The centre has developed a programme of high-quality events, organised in a variety of locations, which have involved sharing the latest academic research on the First World War to enrich and inspire existing and developing projects, workshops and training, showcasing of HLF projects and networking opportunities. As planned in the original application for funding, collaborations with non-HEI bodies has been a key element of the Gateways project and the centre has established and extended strong partnerships with a range of organisations including the Imperial War Museum, First World War Centenary Partnership, Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Significant activities are underway to support these organisations, particularly for the Somme 100 commemorations, and will continue over the next two years. The centre has established UK-wide reach through its travelling exhibitions, events (including a successful community Roadshow) and academic and community collaborations in a number of regions, including Scotland.

Gateways will continue its highly successful programme of themed study days focused on its core research themes and its relationship with key archival centres. The general outline of such events has been to bring together expert researchers on the particular historical theme, relevant archivists and record keepers and, if possible, groups studying that particular theme to present their findings. So far we have staged 11 such events and they have proved extremely positive especially with community groups and organisations many of which have received HLF funding. Many of these events have been delivered with significant partners such as the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and the National Archives.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are working with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, the Royal British Legion and the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on various plans for wider community engagement with the Great War centenary, as well as the Institute of Education's Schools Battlefields Tours programme. We are currently developing a range of collaborative activities including an important contribution to the Third Battle of Ypres centenary in July of this year. This has built on the collaboration effort we made with DCMS to mark Somme 100 last year. We will report more fully on this in next year's summary.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB6B7FFF-14D5-431E-BEE4-B8F6BB12D593</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.gatewaysfww.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D4657B6E-B933-43BF-969C-F87588A21ACC"><gtr:id>D4657B6E-B933-43BF-969C-F87588A21ACC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the national impact of the Jutland Battle: civic and community responses during the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15"><gtr:id>0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bassett, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7A1E00BF-2F7A-463B-9E54-FDCC71A89F57"><gtr:id>7A1E00BF-2F7A-463B-9E54-FDCC71A89F57</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Christmas Truce 1914-1918: Myths and Realities</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e"><gtr:id>bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/398D6B2F-884B-47A8-80F1-948DB5CD61CA"><gtr:id>398D6B2F-884B-47A8-80F1-948DB5CD61CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mass Observers and the centenary of the First World War: Gender, generation and the emotional</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Women's History Review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0532759c1d147cef99e3d7d9d3e7007"><gtr:id>a0532759c1d147cef99e3d7d9d3e7007</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Noakes, L.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:issn>1747583</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B4CEBA4C-4EEA-4D4A-B824-A4870081F187"><gtr:id>B4CEBA4C-4EEA-4D4A-B824-A4870081F187</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)'</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e"><gtr:id>bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3C5C6865-8DAB-418E-BC52-A4A684969A37"><gtr:id>3C5C6865-8DAB-418E-BC52-A4A684969A37</gtr:id><gtr:title>Remembering the Great War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d49c9df6846155e64bcb1f81ce2b8286"><gtr:id>d49c9df6846155e64bcb1f81ce2b8286</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Grant P and Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-415-85632-4</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9FF053C7-41C8-4BE5-AC91-D2FF54FA61A1"><gtr:id>9FF053C7-41C8-4BE5-AC91-D2FF54FA61A1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mapping the national impact of the Jutland Battle: civic and community responses during the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Maritime History</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15"><gtr:id>0fd49bcaf4e55c0057738f75c71fdf15</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bassett, M.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8B951FED-25D5-4636-9AE6-398542F525FC"><gtr:id>8B951FED-25D5-4636-9AE6-398542F525FC</gtr:id><gtr:title>British Contemporary Memory of the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Mat?riaux pour l'histoire de notre temps: M?moires de la Grande Guerre</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e"><gtr:id>bc2ef603c57cb2ba772e2fa7c539ef0e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hanna, E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0BFB3E81-F0D1-43A1-8BC3-39A706B6E0BE"><gtr:id>0BFB3E81-F0D1-43A1-8BC3-39A706B6E0BE</gtr:id><gtr:title>A broken silence?
