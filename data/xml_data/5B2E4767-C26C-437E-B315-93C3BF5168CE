Particular attention will be paid to sexual relationships, and to relationships issues that may be specific to these groups, which may be linked to culture or religion. The research explores the role of stories and storytelling in relationships. It focuses on relationship stories that are told in everyday life (with friends, for example) and also in art forms such as poetry, fiction, films and radio. It investigates existing stories and also involves participants in making and sharing new stories. This attention to 'ordinary' relationships will complement current attention, including some urgent and important research, and some less helpful, sensational media stories and political interventions, directed at cases of sexual abuse (by British Pakistani men) and forced marriage (of young British Pakistani women and men). 

The study will reflect some of the diversity of British Pakistani Muslims, in terms of linguistic, ethnic, religious, class and educational backgrounds, which map onto differences in sexual relationship practices. Research will take place in three areas: Yorkshire, Glasgow, and Tyne and Wear. We will work with community organisations which support young British Pakistani Muslim men and women in their sexual lives and relationships, such as community youth helplines, introduction agencies, and marriage counselling and advice services. 

This is a three-year project involving a number of different individuals and organizations, most of whom will be involved at particular stages and times, rather than throughout. The research team will conduct interviews with young British Pakistani Muslim men and women to explore ways in which relationship experiences often reflect cultural and religious expectations, precedents and norms. These interviews will also explore stories could be told that aren't; what difficult issues could be tackled and explored in this way; what positive practices and experiences could be articulated and shared; and what may be best left unsaid.

We will then hold some reading gupshops (a term combining 'workshops' and 'gupshup', the Urdu word for informal chat) to explore what people know and feel about stories that are already being told and shared about sexual relationship practices involving British Pakistani Muslims. Next, storytelling workshops will be used to develop new relationship stories through creative writing (fiction and autobiography) or documentary (film and radio). These will be led by writers or documentary makers who are themselves British Muslims. Subsequently, in-depth interviews with workshop participants will reflect on experiences of participating in the project. Those who are happy to have their work published or otherwise disseminated to a wider public (for example, at the Bradford Literature Festival, and through the internet) will be encouraged to do so, and supported in doing so.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Co-production is central to this research project. Accordingly, pathways to impact are embedded in the research design, and there is significant overlap between participants, stakeholders and other beneficiaries. The impact plan addresses two questions:

I. Who will benefit? 

This project has potential for impact through 3 overlapping groups: research participants, stakeholders and the wider public: 

1. Participants include individual young BPM, creative practitioners, and two types of organisations: those that support young BPM in relation to their sexual relationship practices and choices, and others with broader interests in social inclusion and community relations. 

2. Some of the organisations referred to above will also be engaged as stakeholders. Other stakeholders include wider BPM communities in the UK, and organisations that seek to support them. Stakeholder groups are an integral to the project, enabling the research to optimize beneficial impacts for these organisations and the communities and individuals they represent and support.

3. This research also stands to benefit the wider public through greater understanding of BPM sexual attitudes and practices, which may contribute to improved community relations. 

II. How will they benefit?

Those identified above will benefit from involvement in the research process and through the dissemination of findings in the following ways: 

-Individual participants in interviews, storytelling workshops and reading gupshops will see immediate and ongoing benefit from engagement with and involvement in the research. They may become more reflective about their sexual relationship attitudes and practices, and better able to negotiate and represent these within their families and communities.

-Creative practitioners who participate in workshops will benefit from having their work disseminated to community and wider audiences, and will gain experience from working together and with the team.

-Individuals who participate as community interviewers will benefit through the acquisition of skills and experiences, which they may transfer to other settings. Capacity-building workshops will reinforce and build upon the skills training and experiences gained through the project itself. 

-Organisations that participate in this research will benefit through access to resources that they can use in their work with young BPM. This will be realised through the production, dissemination and discussion of relationship stories. 

-Through stakeholder workshops, various community groups with a variety of interests (health, education, cultural, social inclusion) will be engaged with research findings and research methodologies, and will develop understandings of how to use these within their organisational practices.

-It is anticipated that the research findings will inform local government organisations and government agencies and improve their engagement with BPM communities and community organizations. 

-Wider BPM communities will also benefit in 2 ways. First, this project will open up, if not a singular debate, then a series of much-needed small conversations about sexuality and sexual relationships. This will enable BPM communities as a whole to become more reflective and better able to represent views on sexual relationships and practices, with an improved ability to challenge negative stereotypes and cultural racism. Second, as this project gives voice to ordinary rather than sensational sexual relationships among BPM communities, and as stereotypes about these communities are therefore countered, these communities stand to benefit from better relations and clearer understandings in relation to the majority society. 

-The public will also benefit from improved understandings of BPM communities through the project's engagement with artists, creative practitioners and media, and public events.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>473065</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation of work in Progress: Kings College London (8 March 2017)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C5F15775-8FF8-4A7B-A832-413F6AB84492</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited presentation by PI of work in progress, delivered to academic audience at Kings College London, composed of academic staff and postgraduate students, with discussion</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Community Interviewer Training Event: Yorkshire (Huddersfield, 26 Nov 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23556659-A50B-4FEE-AB02-CB687A141476</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Community interviewer training event, with capacity building outcomes for participants.
