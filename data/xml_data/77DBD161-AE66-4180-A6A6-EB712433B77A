Despite recent technological improvements in this field, state-of-the-art glazing systems fail to make efficient use of materials, have a low robustness, a relatively high thermal conductivity, and are rarely recycled.
Recent research developments in glass engineering, adhesive bonding and fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites provide an opportunity to explore a novel combination of these materials in the form of FRP-glass composite structures. These consist of glass plates that are bonded to pultruded FRP profiles by means of high strength - high stiffness thermosetting adhesives, thereby forming an FRP-glass composite panel . This is a novel, yet relatively simple concept, but it involves a radical shift in the role of glass in buildings: from its current use as an inefficient infill panel in a layered system, to a structurally and thermally efficient component within a robust and recyclable composite structure.
The aim of this 24 month project is two-fold: Firstly to characterise the thermo-mechanical properties and environmental impact of a first generation, yet novel, form of composite FRP-glass panel; and secondly to explore the feasibility of more adventurous second generation composite glass panels. The latter offer further improvements over the basic FRP-glass panels, in terms of structural performance, adaptability and recyclability. This aim will be achieved by means of coordinated thermo-mechanical investigations involving physical experiments, numerical modelling and theoretical analyses at three levels: (1) material level, (2) FRP-glass connection level; and (3) full-scale composite glass panel level, 
The evaluation of the potential benefits of composite glass panels and the fundamental properties characterised in this project will: (1) provide a basis for future research and product development in this new sub-field; (2) help produce novel glazed building envelopes that significantly out-perform existing state-of the-art glazing systems; (3) lead to step-change improvements in the sustainability and resilience of new and existing buildings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project proposes a novel combination of FRP and glass which if successful, would ultimately lead to step-change improvements in the sustainability and resilience of existing and future buildings. The impacts in the built environment will be technological (novel form FRP-glass components), societal (resilient and more efficient buildings), economical (cheaper and thinner building envelopes) and environmental (thermal performance of buildings, minimise materials usage, recyclability). This research will also have impacts in sectors where glass is used in conjunction with other materials (e.g. automotive and consumer products).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239570</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with engineering consultant: Arup</gtr:description><gtr:id>9729DC91-9AAA-4452-8D1E-0F51D9C52E4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Arup are supporting the new proposal the new FRP-Glass proposal.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Knowledge and expertise on real-world facade engineering</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing test data on FRP-glass composites</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Industry Engagement Symposium / Workshop at the University of Cambridge</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>705617BE-159A-4E52-8910-8A6004955733</gtr:id><gtr:impact>80 people from industry and other research centres attended the Engineered Skins Symposium organised by my Glass &amp;amp; Facade Technology Research Team at the University of Cambridge on 9th September 2015.

The models allow to calculate deflections and strains in complex sandwich structures subjected to transverse loads. The models are formulated in general terms and are therefore applicable to any multi-layer sandwich structure in any are of application. The models have been included in an open-source publication and are therefore publicly available to any engineer interested in the modelling of sandwich structures.</gtr:description><gtr:id>67E5A0CE-3DF9-412A-8D4B-614C116C9E34</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The models are novel and constitute a step-change in the capability to predict analytically the response of complex sandwich structures, e.g. structures with shear-flexible adhesives and cores. The models are valid for any type of sandwich structure, but in this specific project they have been used to support and optimise the design of novel adhesive-bonded GFRP-glass sandwich units for building facades. The methodology developed in these models can be applied not only to sandwich structures but also to other structural typologies in the building and bridge construction sector, e.g. frame systems and box-girders.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Analytical models of bending rigidity and shear stiffness for adhesively-bonded sandwich structures</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data analysis technique</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0263822316314507</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/28C6C9DA-01C0-4CFA-B56D-F526D16D2CFE"><gtr:id>28C6C9DA-01C0-4CFA-B56D-F526D16D2CFE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The mechanical response of cold bent monolithic glass plates during the bending process</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Engineering Structures</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b41d6a413d22c22796f058e0051166c0"><gtr:id>b41d6a413d22c22796f058e0051166c0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Datsiou K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4B9691C3-EFA7-4551-802B-7FF03EE4FCE5"><gtr:id>4B9691C3-EFA7-4551-802B-7FF03EE4FCE5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Adhesively-bonded GFRP-glass sandwich components for structurally efficient glazing applications</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Composite Structures</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a2885683783099a636f5641f9d4b70f0"><gtr:id>a2885683783099a636f5641f9d4b70f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Pascual C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DF7919CA-2374-44CC-8210-E92BC6FE56DE"><gtr:id>DF7919CA-2374-44CC-8210-E92BC6FE56DE</gtr:id><gtr:title>Review of current status, requirements and opportunities for building performance simulation of adaptive facades</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Building Performance Simulation</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b3c5c6b31b1bad629f71b5fc876898ae"><gtr:id>b3c5c6b31b1bad629f71b5fc876898ae</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Loonen R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M017699/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
