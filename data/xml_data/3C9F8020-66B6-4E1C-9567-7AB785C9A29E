These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1235329</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Costain Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Costain Letter of Support for the PETRAS National IoT Research Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>6D082F0A-8881-4B09-9927-30ACC79E8C01</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Costain have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

Letter of Support

This letter is drawn to endorse and support Warwick University et. Al. for the 'Cyber Security Call' and the proposed Centre for the Internet of Things directed by Professor Jeremy Watson.

Costain Limited is a leading Engineering Solutions provider, operating in Highways, Rail, Water, Oil and Gas, Power and Nuclear Process.
Costain Limited strategically supports Research and Development and our relationship with Warwick University is evident of this commitment. Our relationship with Warwick University is proving to be very productive and dynamic after our recent successes with Innovate UK and our research initiatives; hence Costain is keen to be involved, working closely with Warwick University in their proposal to establish a proposed multidisciplinary Centre for the Internet of Things. As Costain develops as a business, we recognise the importance of data security in a technology economy and having the skills to manage this effectively to protect national infrastructure is significantly important for industry to understand grater and embrace.

Costain would like to pledge its full support to Warwick University and would like to make the following contributions:
&amp;middot; Highways R&amp;amp;D Lead Mohammed Shah to manage the relationship between all parties
&amp;middot; Hosting of meeting at our various offices UK-Wide
&amp;middot; Supplying research data
&amp;middot; Giving access to research facilities or equipment
&amp;middot; Become an external member of an &amp;quot;advisory group&amp;quot; 
&amp;middot; Attend multidisciplinary workshops and &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; run by the Centre around certain themes and challenges
&amp;middot; Hosting secondments of research staff and students from the Centre (short/long term)
&amp;middot; Secondment of staff from the company into the Centre (short/long term)
&amp;middot; Contributing in-kind expertise and advice through regular (e.g. annual) bilateral meetings with Centre investigators/leaders

Due to the close working relationship with Warwick, the importance of this research for our customers and the economy we are investing significantly to support this application. Based on the activities above we see our commitment as a partner to be very active in the Centre. We are pledging &amp;pound;200,000 / year in-kind over the next 3 year which will total of &amp;pound;600,000 over the first phase of the Centres research focus. This commitment is based on a &amp;pound;1bn of our turnover having significant data requirements associated with assets of national importance and the stringent requirements UK Government is placing on this topic.

We look forward to working closely with Warwick University and it's consortium on this very welcomed and timely R&amp;amp;D initiative.

Yours sincerely

Re: TRL Statement of support for the Centre for Internet of Things
TRL, the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, is an internationally recognised centre of excellence providing world-class research, consultancy and product testing, covering all aspects of transport. TRL was established in 1933 and since that time has continually made significant and lasting contributions to the development of safe, efficient and effective transport systems in the UK and beyond. We currently employ around 375 staff, most of whom are technical specialists in their field, with experts in engineering, statistics, software, psychology and human factors. TRL has access to a range of dedicated facilities including modelling &amp;amp; simulation software, advanced driving simulators, crash test rigs and test tracks. Our head office is in Crowthorne, Berkshire and the company has an annual turnover in excess of &amp;pound;30m. Satellite offices operate in Scotland, Wales, Dubai and Qatar. TRL operates the TRL Academy, an internal body with responsibility for maintaining the academic and research strengths upon which the organisation is founded. The Academy also manages our ongoing engagement with a range of universities and research organisations from the UK and beyond.
We are well aware of the strong capabilities of the core university partners and have a number of research connections. We are, for example, working with Warwick on a &amp;quot;Towards autonomy - Smart and connected control&amp;quot; EPSRC project so are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative.
TRL's business focuses on the generation and application of knowledge in the transport domain. We anticipate that IoT will be a major driver for innovation and development in transport over the next 10 years and will have a huge impact on the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of transport systems of all kinds. It is therefore vital that we understand these developments so that we remain relevant to our markets and customers and are better placed to generate and apply new knowledge in the area. We anticipate that IoT will impact particularly on connected and automated vehicles and on smart cities/smart infrastructure, all of which are important areas of work for us but also areas where the threat of cyber-crime is increasingly high-profile. We also need to understand how these aspects will be handled and will affect our clients and our work.

We intend to engage with and contribute to the Research Hub in a number of ways. Firstly, we would seek to participate as members of the External Advisory Group to help provide direction and governance to the programme. Secondly, we would help to develop the scope for projects undertaken within the Centre's programme based on our knowledge of the domain and future research requirements; this will include participation in workshops, &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; and the like. Thirdly, depending on the scope of the research, we may be able to supply research data or access to specific facilities or equipment. Finally, we would hope to find suitable projects in which we can collaborate (e.g. by contribution of staff effort, secondment of staff to the centre, hosting of centre staff at TRL and co-supervising PhD students).
It is difficult to define the precise financial value of our proposed in-kind support. For budgetary estimation purposes, we suggest maximum values for the four items described over a three year period as follows:
1. Participation in External Advisory Group activities &amp;pound;10k
2. Project scoping and advice &amp;pound;10k
3. Access to data and facilities &amp;pound;30k
4. Project collaboration &amp;pound;60k

In conclusion, we are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative directed by Professor Jeremy Watson of UCL. The Centre for the Internet of Things can develop as a Research Hub of activity in this priority area for the UK and TRL can play an active role in supporting its development and operation. We highly commend this proposal and look forward to joining a first class team.
Yours sincerely
