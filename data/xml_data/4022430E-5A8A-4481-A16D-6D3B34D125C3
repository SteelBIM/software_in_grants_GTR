Taking a broad chronological sweep across a geographically and culturally contained area this project allows for concentration on specific areas of conceptualization. Within those confines, however, the project will take a broad, even a catholic, approach to wrongdoing. Thus it will encompass on the one hand a formal spectrum ranging from acts forbidden by the law (whether national or local), through acts forbidden by the Church (and conveyed through encyclicals, catechisms and sermons), to more philosophical questions of responsibility and agency, and on the other more popular attitudes to wrongdoing (conveyed characteristically through ephemeral publications). \n\nThe term 'wrongdoing' is used to encompass a broad range. It is more than what is found to be criminal by legislation, and covers what is 'morally unjust, unfair, amiss or improper; the opposite or right or justice; the negation of equity, goodness or rectitude' (OED). Wrongdoing suggests actions, perpetrators, and a spectrum of intention or awareness. It is a profoundly moral concept, the arbiters of which may come from a variety of disciplines, as well as referring to wrongs covered by the law. \n\nRather than a historical or sociological account of wrongdoing and its vicissitudes in Spain the intention of the project is to explore society's understanding of wrongdoing, and the way that this is translated into the world of culture. It is thus concerned not just with wrongdoing, but with the social and cultural responses it elicits. Such responses include anxiety, anger, desire for retribution, identification with perpetrators or victims of wrongdoing, the potential for vicarious engagement with wrongdoing through cultural artefacts. It allows for questioning of the processes through which it is evident that we, as cultural consumers, take a type of pleasure in wrongdoing. The evident public fascination with it can be traced from medieval ballad through to nineteenth-century broadsides, and eventually to sensationalist literary or visual representations of wrongdoing in our day.\n\nWhile clearly related to a specific place and period, the questions raised for examination in the project have clear relevance for understanding modern culture, where wrongdoing persists, and where our fascination with it continues. The project thus provides a safe space within which sensitive issues that provoke reactions such as hostility, excitement and horror can be examined. Crossing a variety of disciplines, it engages with wrongdoing as a complex cultural phenomenon, a cultural object for consumption as well as a profound and vital concept for society.\n\nA key part of the project, related to its emphasis on popular material, is the cataloguing and digitization of a significant body of popular material held at the University Library, Cambridge, and the British Library. This material is of 'pliegos sueltos' (chapbooks) and is an ephemeral genre, frequently sensationalist, and habitually sold in the street. It includes ballads and prose writings on wrongdoing, some of them relating to real acts of crime or moral infraction, others being fictional in nature. This body of material offers a rich source of investigation for the project, and will be read in conjunction with other material (newspaper accounts of crime, judicial proceedings on the one hand, and fictional works on wrongdoing to be found in both popular culture and elite culture). The digitization of the 'pliegos sueltos' will be a significant contribution to the stewardship, conservation and enhanced accessibility of a body of cultural material which has its counterparts in English, and which allow the research to take place in a broader academic and cultural material which has its counterparts in English, and which allows the research to take place in a broader academic and cultural context.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?\nThe main anticipated beneficiaries of this research, other than the academic community, will include members of the UK general public interested in popular literature and culture, social history and the social sciences, and will be relevant to A-level students of sociology, media studies, history and curricula involving literature. \n\nHow will they benefit from this research?\n1. The main channels of the impact will be the University Library, Cambridge (UL) and the British Library (BL), and will draw on their experience of outreach to the general public. The CSIC will act as the portal of impact to the Spanish public. \n2. This impact will come initially from the digitized and catalogued material, and will be built upon by activities that will signal its interest and relevance to a wider public, suggesting ways in which the work of the project is relevant to a wider field. \n3. Digitization of the chapbooks will give the general public constant access at their desktops to this material, normally only accessible to researchers, minimizing handling of the delicate originals. (Impact immediate) \n4. In addition to the UK public, prime users in Spain will gain access to an important and insufficiently documented part of their national heritage. (Impact immediate).\n5. The exhibitions at the UL and BL, in years 2 and 3 respectively, containing items from the project and comparable items in English and other languages will raise public awareness of an important UK popular heritage.\n6. Public talks accompanying the exhibitions will place the extended material in a broader and thought-provoking context, allowing for exploration of some of the research questions to do with wrongdoing and its representation. For the general public, there is thus impact on the understanding of important features in our culture such as violence, wrongdoing, and our responses to it, which may range from revulsion to (more frequently) fascination. Understanding this could have impact for social policy and education. (Impact difficult to measure, and in the long term). \n7. There is a more general value of arousing public interest in social history, and in topics that relate either directly or tangentially to our experience. This sort of interest, entailing the stimulation of curiosity and thoughtfulness, has impact on shifting us away from a passive leisure culture to one of active engagement through the intelligence in the world about us.\n\nWhat will be done to ensure that they benefit from this research?\n1. Exhibition in year 2 of the project at the UL using material from the Spanish collections, and the Tower collection (http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/deptserv/towerproject/), and other material, accompanied by talks open to the general public related to the broader aspects of the exhibition during the Festival of Ideas (October), and to alumni and visitors at the alumni weekend (September). \n2. Exhibition in year 3 of the project at the BL, in conjunction with an open public conference, on 'Crime and Misdemeanour'. Timing for summer of year 3 to maximize possible attendance of visitors to London.\n3. Ongoing collaboration with expert consultants at the CSIC throughout the project will lead to further publicization of the work of the project in Spain. The CSIC has an established history of outreach to the general public.\n4. The UL is embarking on activity to attract local schools to its specialized exhibitions, and we will aim to take part in this.\n5. Maintenance of website related to the project.\n6. Broadcasts and interviews on the material in the UK and Spain.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>600764</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Exhibition of popular street literature of England and Spain in the long nineteenth century relating to wrongdoing.
