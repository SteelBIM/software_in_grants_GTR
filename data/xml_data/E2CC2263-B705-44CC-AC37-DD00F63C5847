body</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J02208X/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The seminar series will develop inter-professional understandings of young people's sexual bodies across key policy areas. It will do so through facilitating a creative dialogue between academics and practitioners, recognising that they often approach these issues from different perspectives, with different constraints and with different desired outcomes. A key difference stems from the very different world views of social scientists and medical scientists. In particular, social and cultural factors are not always fully recognised within biomedical literature (Einsten and Shildrick 2009). Einsten and Shildrick have further suggested that since the 1970s sociological feminist health theory and women's health practice have developed different understandings of the body, and they call for dialogue and openness between social scientists and clinicians around the subject of the body in healthcare provision. This series will promote such a dialogue as a starting point, and will then target a number of key policy areas in relation to young people's sexual bodies. These are: contraception and reproduction; sexual violence and bullying; sexualisation; sex and relationships education; and sexual behaviour and sexuality. 

The series will draw on cutting edge research on young people's sexual health, relationships, sex education, and the role of media, popular culture, commerce and technologies in the construction of different understandings of the young sexual body. It will draw together two groups: firstly: leading academics, early career researchers and PhD students working in the key fields of childhood and youth studies, health and social policy, sexuality, sexual exploitation, sex and relationships education, and media and communication studies; and secondly: practitioners and agencies dealing with young people's sexual health and education in the UK (for example, Brook, Education for Choice, British Pregnancy Advisory Service, Sex Education Forum) and GPs and clinicians. A core group of ten participants constructed from these two groups will ensure continuity of discussion and learning throughout the series. The series will also build on a previous series funded by the ESRC (2010-2011): 'Pornified: complicating debates on the sexualization of culture'. Organisers of an AHRC funded research network, 'Onscenity', will also be participating.

This series thus aims to foster partnerships, and creative dialogue, between leading academics and practitioners broadly concerned with young people's sexualities and sexual health. Further, it aims to include front-line practitioners' experiences and perspectives within this dialogue so it is a dynamic interactive two-way process The seminar series aims to enable and explore joint understandings. Insights generated through current theoretically informed applied social research will be examined in the light of educational and clinical issues concerning young people's sexualities and sexual health. The series will question what we understand by young people's sexual bodies, and what kinds of diverse sexual behaviours exist. It will explore the notion of difference through locating different sexual bodies and behaviours within diverse social and cultural contexts and it will consider how gender, race, ethnicity, age, ability, class, and religious 'norms' impact on these. It will also examine notions of choice in relation to concerns such as bodily control, reproductive rights and sexual freedom. Key concepts such as risk, desire, safety, innocence, promiscuity, empowerment, and agency will be explored and critiqued. Discussions will focus on developing a grounded understanding of all these issues and their implications for young people's lives. 

A website, final report and other publications will be used to disseminate the findings of the series to as wide an audience as possible. The overall aim is to facilitate the impact of applied social research in the policy areas being analysed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A wide range of non-academic professionals and practitioners are likely to benefit from the proposed seminar series. These include: health care professionals, sex and sexual health educators; social care professionals; GPs; clinicians; youth workers; and charities and other organizations representing and/or supporting young people. Representatives from all these groups have attended a previous Sexual Health Research and Practice Conference at the University of Greenwich, and all have expressed an interest in learning about how applied social research can improve their practice. This is a key objective of the seminar series, and we have already invited a number of such practitioners as participants and speakers (as detailed in the Pathways ti Impact). Discussions will cover a number of themes including the relationships between different social and cultural contexts; young people's experiences and expectations; and the role of education in preparing young people for sexual relationships, adolescence and adulthood. 
As our case for support outlines, the seminar series will take place in a context of anxieties about the young sexual body. These anxieties incorporate fears about the growing 'sexualization' of young people, reports of sexual violence and exploitation, and continuing concerns about unintentional pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. These are just some of the issues that practitioners, and policy-makers, are grappling with. The seminar series will address these, and other relevant, issues from academic and practitioner perspectives. The Errant Body seminar, for example, will investigate at least three key (under-researched) questions that practitioners working in contraceptive and sexual health settings are asking: why are increasing numbers of young women presenting for repeat abortions? Why are young women who do not want to become pregnant not taking emergency contraception following an incident of 'unprotected' sex? Why do so many young women have a contraceptive implant removed within one year of having it fitted? Each of the seminars has been carefully designed around a set of issues that are of concern to practitioners, and are currently being addressed in academic research. 
The series will also benefit policy-makers and commissioners as improved understandings of these issues can influence that way in which professionals and agencies design policy interventions; as well as encouraging academics to recognize policy and practical constraints in their research plans and recommendations. Outputs from the series will help agencies and practitioners develop more effective practice. Finally, the participation of the sexual health programme leaders from the University of Greenwich and Anglia Ruskin University will ensure that lessons learnt will be incorporated into sexual health practitioners' training.
Services for young people are often driven by the needs to achieve targets and prevent 'risky' sexual behaviour. Young people, however, may have different priorities and needs that can undermine much of the rationale underpinning policy and provision. The seminar series will enable discussion of innovative and flexible approaches to the exploration of the issues and needs relevant to young people. It will also facilitate collaborations between practitioners and academics that will feed into the provision of services to young people. 
The series will see the development of a web-based resource which will be widely publicised via existing academic/professional networks and which will realise the series' potential for ensuring that future research builds on existing knowledge and good practice. The results of the seminar series will also be presented as a report outlining differences, continuities and pressing issues across academic disciplines and practitioner boundaries and will be disseminated to charities, education groups, policy makers and youth organizations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4048</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is a 10 minute drama addressing the hetero-sexualisation of boy-girl friendships and the sexism and heterosexism of playground cultures in the last year of primary school.

One of the key findings was how angry children felt about having lived in a sexist and sexualised peer culture and society. A key aim of this conference was to provide a platform where boys and girls can have their say and learn what other children think about body image, fashion, bullying, friendships and relationships in school, in communities and online.
Workshops were run by young people (secondary school students) and facilitated by Professor Renold and PhD students focusing on gender/sexuality related topics.

Body Talk (a movement workshop with choreographer, Jen Anghared, Canolfan a Theatr Soar)
- Challenging Gender Stereotyping in Schools (Mark Jennett, Education Consultant, and Co-Ordinator of 'Breaking the Mould' project.)
- Staying safe and having fun online (Andy Phippen, University of Plymouth)
- Just good friends?: a peer-led PSE lesson on relationship cultures (with DIGON, Ysgol Plasmawr)
- Building feelings (Lego workshop on gender stereotypes in the media with FF - NEWID, Ysgol Plasmawr)
- Camping Out (Making gender feel-good shelters in a tent decorating workshop with Emma Renold)

There was also be an opportunity for researchers interested in research impact and public engagement to stay on for a roundtable after the children's conference has finished (led by Professor Emma Renold).


A key outcome of the day was to bridge the silence between children's worlds, and between children and teacher worlds. This was achieved (teacher feedback and pupil feedback)

A key outcome of the day was to enable boys and girls to discuss the pressures of gender stereotypes and combat gender and sexual bullying. This was achieved via feedback from each workshop, and in the children's comments from the 'wall of thoughts' (see pictures on the URL below)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://feminismsinschool.wordpress.com/2014/07/18/girls-and-boys-speak-out-conference/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>practitioner conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C39890E-D729-47B1-9EC9-5F8157630591</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation resulted in discussion about professional interaction with women who have more than one abortion

After the event two sub-groups were formed to take forward ideas for future collaborative research. The first on designing a contraceptive consultation model, and the second to work on abortion providers and abortion stigma.

Applicants have been involved in contributing to government guidance and policy development on sexualisation, sex education, sexual health and online safety in England (Government Equalities Office, Body Confidence Campaign, Department of Health, Public Health England) and Wales (Welsh Assembly Government). Applicants have also been active in co-production of training materials and pedagogy with practitioners. As a direct result from our collaborations with international keynote, Rasmussen (Australia) in Seminar 3, we have been commissioned to co-ordinate the chapters on pedagogic practice for the young sexual bodies in a new International Handbook of Sexuality Education (Routledge forthcoming).

Research dissemination channels developed for the seminar series played an important role in the dissemination of research findings for all applicants. They were utilised by Hoggart, for example, for abortion and contraceptive research dissemination that had an impact recognised in the 2014 REF entry for the University of Greenwich where it formed an impact case study for UoA3. papers presented int he series by Hoggart and by Newton prompted partnerships that helped facilitate a number of impacts mentioned in the case study. These included: 'the delivery of a public service has changed' where we noted that there has been a change in contraceptive counselling practice in a number of local areas (eg Greenwich, Hillingdon) where women are now given more information about all possible side-effects of the contraceptive implant, and also advised to return to the clinic as soon as they become concerned about side effects, and that therapeutic interventions can be offered to alleviate bleeding-related side-effects. These changes have been recommended at training workshops conducted by Jane Dickson (consultant in sexual health) throughout the country. A second relevant impact in the case study was that 'Professional training has been influenced by the research'. Again this was facilitated by partnerships emerging from the seminar series. Hoggart and Newton have worked closely with partners to incorporate the findings of their long acting contraceptive research into practitioner training and thus maximise the impact of the research in clinical practice.

Papers from the series have been published in the practitioner journals, Journal for Family Planning and Reproductive Healthcare and Contraception. Other papers have been published in the journal Sexualities, and a special issue on queer sexualities in Discourse: Cultural Politics of Education and the forthcoming edited collection, 'Children, Sexuality and The Sexualisation of Culture' (Renold, Ringrose and Egan). Further academic publications are noted in the Publications section for this award.

Jessica Ringrose and Emma Renolds (along with Alison Phipps and Carolyn Jackson) have had a special issue approved for Journal of Gender Studies. This is a direct outcome of the collaboration between the one day event (led by Jessica Ringrose), 'Researching Girls' Sexualities: Materiality, Affect and the Digital'; which the seminar series partially supported. The special issue for the journal is: 'Rape culture, Laddism and Everyday Sexism: New Mediations of Gender and Sexual Violence'. 

Finally, we have at least four on-going academic/practitioner partnerships (specified in the collaborations and partnerships) that were formed as a result of the series. We anticipate further research and development activities, and societal and cultural impact to arise from the activities of these partnerships.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A672119B-DA6B-427F-9828-6D5DA69A1B78</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This award is for a seminar series so we do not have research findings per se. But we do have one finding: successful partnerships between academics and practitioners can be developed through an academic seminar series. Our most significant achievement is that we have developed practitioner/academia partnerships in the course of this series that have led to collaborations, and to the development of research proposals. These collaborations are reported in other sections of Researchfish. Only the most significant achievements of the series are noted in this section.

Participation in the series has been very successful. Each seminar successfully brought together key stakeholders from government and industry including practitioners (teachers, doctors, youth workers, trainers) expert groups, NGOs and charities, postgraduates and early career researchers, leading academics across disciplines, and international scholarly experts to explore young people and issues of health, education and sexuality in detail. All the seminar organisers benefited from this dialogue which helped them develop a fuller understanding of how to build research impact. In particular, the PI (Lesley Hoggart) incorporated this knowledge into the development of her sexual health case study that was highly commended in the 2014 REF (for University of Greenwich). 

Our work on bringing together biomedical and social understandings of the young sexual body, has led to a new practitioner/academic collaboration around a biosocial theme, detailed below.

The seminar series website has been moved from the University of Greenwich to the Open University. This gives details of each seminar programme including full abstracts and session summaries. It also includes an overall report of the series for which we have embedded links to useful resources for academics and practitioners. Full details of each seminar can be found at: 
http://www.open.ac.uk/health-and-social-care/research/understanding-young-sexual-body/

Significant new knowledge generated through discussions on papers presented in the series has resulted in academic publications. Papers from the series have been published in the journal Sexualities; and accepted for publication in a forthcoming special issue on queer sexualities in Discourse: Cultural Politics of Education; and the forthcoming edited collection, 'Children, Sexuality and The Sexualisation of Culture' (Renold, Ringrose and Egan). Papers from seminar 2 will be published in a Special Section of Women's Studies International Forum. As a direct result from our collaborations with international keynote, Rasmussen (Australia) in Seminar 3, we have been commissioned to co-ordinate the chapters on pedagogic practice for the young sexual bodies in a new International Handbook of Sexuality Education (Routledge forthcoming).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have a number of partnerships that have been developed as a result of the seminar series. These are detailed in other sections of this entry. We also have a final report that is available on the seminar series website, and this report has links to relevant resources for practitioners and academics. 

Applicants have been involved in contributing to government guidance and policy development on sexualisation, sex education, sexual health and online safety in England (Government Equalities Office, Body Confidence Campaign, A Framework for Sexual Health Improvement in England) and Wales (Welsh Assembly Government). Applicants have also been active in co-production of training materials and pedagogy with practitioners. 

We are also working with one of the practitioners who attended seminar 2 (Sue Mann) to develop a Biosocial proposal focused on hormonal contraception for the latest ESRC call for seminars.
