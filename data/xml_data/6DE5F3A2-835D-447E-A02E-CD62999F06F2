In roll-to-roll processing of printed electronics, surface instabilities at the nip cause uneven splitting of the inks, resulting in a non-uniform deposition affecting the performance and capabilities of printed devices. This project will address this issue by establishing an improved understanding of the role of surface instabilities in extensional flows for complex fluids. An original approach will be developed for the quantitative analysis of surface instabilities, based on the analysis of the transition from a planar extensional flow of a fluid ring to multiple uniaxial extensional filaments in a novel designed planar extensional annular tester (PEAT). By extending the fluid ring between two separating annular plates, the role of surface instabilities will be analysed over a wide range of extensional rates, avoiding cavitation issues. The PEAT will be integrated with a conventional rotational rheometer, allowing the coupling of extensional planar flows with shear oscillations to be studied. Newtonian and Complex fluids will be extensively tested, coupling their rheological properties and flow characteristics with the instabilities transitions. Experimental studies will be supported by computational modelling for better understanding of flow characteristics. Finally printed electronics inks will be tested evaluating the developed models and offering the opportunity to identify key flow parameters to improve uniformity of printed layers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Printed and Organic Large area electronics is a major disruptive technology with a worldwide $16.04 billion market in 2013, predicted to be $76.79 billion by 2023 (estimates by IDtechEX, 2013). Surface instabilities in extensional flows have fundamental consequences in roll-to-roll processing of printed electronics. Surface instabilities at the nip cause uneven splitting of the inks, resulting in a non-uniform deposition affecting the performance and capabilities of printed devices. Improved understanding of surface instabilities in extensional flows would lead to improved understanding and control on uniformity of deposited layers. A control crucial for innovative applications and development of roll-to-roll printing processes. This would have important repercussion in the economy (with development of novel markets, products, such as flexible OLEDs), quality of life (improved printed biosensors) and environment (reduction of manufacturing waste). 

The principal investigator has been extensively involved in research collaborations with international companies involved in Printed Electronics. A successful grant outcome will form an important stepping stone in strengthening and develop further collaborations, through offering a unique and world leading understanding of the rheology involved in roll-to-roll printing. From an economic perspective, the aim is to convert this knowledge in to wealth, by exploiting the generated intellectual property through collaborations which will lead to new products and capital investments within the UK, supporting UK economic success in a strategic technology market, identified as priority area by UK government.

This research will complement, covering unexplored areas, research already funded by EPSRC, such as &amp;quot;EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacture in large area electronics&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre&amp;quot; for advanced functional coatings.
The project will contribute to a knowledge-based society through the continued personal development of one post doctoral research assistant, in addition to the education of one Ph.D. candidate and several Masters Degree students. The skills acquired by these students and early career researchers will be highly sought after in the academic sector and in an expanding industrial sector.

Together with industry and academic establishment, the wider community will be engaged, to ensure a full transfer of knowledge to the society. A dedicated webpage to the project will be developed and a YouTube channel will be updated with regular videos of wider interest.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98264</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Early Researcher Summer School: Printing of Functional Applications (Swansea)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0CAE68FF-AEF6-4962-A46E-0C427DC3BE47</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Summer school brought together leading speakers from academia across Europe and Industry to deliver an introduction to printable electronics over 5 days of seminars and workshops (July 2015).

The event was attended by over 30 participants, both early researchers and scientists/experts from Industry; mostly from EU (Continental Europe) but also overseas.
The course was co-funded by EU COST FP1104 &amp;quot;New possibilities for print media and packaging - combining print with digital&amp;quot;.
