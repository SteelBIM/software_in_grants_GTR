Despite predictions to the contrary, presidents have been remarkably successful at winning legislative support from fragmented parliaments.The project aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to identify the tools that presidents use to govern in concert with multiparty legislatures&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to assess the effects of these tools on horizontal accountability in new democracies.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The findings of the existing literature accept that the survival of multiparty presidentialism hinges on coalitional politics, but the research moves beyond this in two important ways:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;by striving to identify a much broader array of tools that allow presidents to build interparty coalition&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>by asking whether the provision of these governing tools to executives undermines key elements of accountability to parliament.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Through a comparative analysis of presidential-legislative relations in Armenia, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Kenya, Malawi, Russia and Ukraine, it is shown how strategies of coalition management vary across cases and the impact that this has on the trade-off between policy decisiveness and horizontal accountability. Ultimately, the findings will help to improve the approach of policy makers and politicians working to strengthen legislative capacity and deepen processes of democratisation.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>580888</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Tim Power lectures MoD</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F9B3DC7-2D4E-4C3B-A622-205841F23980</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Lectures that Tim Power gives annually to two units of the Ministry of Defence of the UK government, the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Advanced Command and Staff Course at the Defence Academy of the UK (Shrivenham).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paul Chaisty and Timothy J.

Second, a 6,000 word Research Report was written that summarises the main findings of the Coalitional Presidentialism Project, and translated into Armenian, French, Russian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian, and disseminated to policy makers through the researcher's contacts at the Department for International Development (DFID) and FCO of the UK Government, as well as to interested policy makers in the relevant countries. For example, the Ukrainian version of the report was published by the website of the Ukrainian President's National Institute for Strategic Studies. 

Third, a series of targeted policy briefs were written on each region (Africa, former USSR and Latin America) and disseminated through the same policy networks. In some cases, these findings were also disseminated through the press, for example through Nic Cheeseman's column in the Sunday Nation, the most popular newspaper in Eastern Africa; the Presidential Power blog, run by Advisory Board Member Robert Elgie (www.presidentialpower.com); Dr Nic Cheeseman's popular website aimed at the democracy promotion community, www.democracyinafrica.org; and, Paul Chaisty's discussion of the project's findings on Ukrainian radio. More recently, a piece in the highly regarded Washington Post series the Monkey Cage received considerable engagement. 

Fourth, the Co-Investigators held a series of events targeted at policy makers around the world. In total, 20 dissemination events were held in four countries across three continents, many of which had a significant policy component/audience. These events included:

? a lecture by Tim Power to a new MA programme in Legislative Studies sponsored by the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies in Bras&amp;iacute;lia.
? meetings between Nic Cheeseman the UK High Commissioner to Kenya, Christian Turner, and senior representatives from the FCO and DFID Kenya on legislative strengthening and corruption efforts in the context of coalition government. 
? a briefing that Paul Chaisty gave to the new UK Ambassador to Moscow, where a copy of the research findings was presented.
? a talk by Nic Cheeseman to the Africa section of the Foreign Office at a one-day policy planning workshop/away day that Dr Cheeseman helped to organize.
? a briefing that Nic Cheeseman gave to the new Head of the Africa Directorate, Neil Wigan, at the Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office as part of his induction to the post, which focussed on the challenges that coalitional politics present to democratic consolidation. 
? lectures that Tim Power gives annually to two units of the Ministry of Defence of the UK government, the Royal College of Defence Studies and the Advanced Command and Staff Course at the Defence Academy of the UK (Shrivenham).
? a talk that Tim Power gave to senior policy figures on coalitional presidentialism in Brazil at Chatham House.
? an invited lecture that Tim Power delivered to a private sector audience at the German Federation of Industry in Dusseldorf, Germany.
? a major workshop that was held at the Federal Senate of Brazil in Bras&amp;iacute;lia and which was jointly opened by Senators Cyro Miranda, Flexa Ribeiro, and L&amp;iacute;dice da Mata, by the Ambassador of the United Kingdom, HE Alex Ellis, and by the Director of the Brazilian Legislative Institute Helder Rebou&amp;ccedil;as. This latter event was attended by over 150 people and broadcast on TV in the Senate and online. 
? an international conference that was held at Oxford University, in which senior academics and policy makers discussed the work of the researchers and leading figures across the three continents that the project addresses. Members of the Advisory Board participated in these discussions, including as Elizabeth Teague, who analyses Russian politics for the FCO.

Fifth, a website was created and maintained to disseminate publications, policy briefs and information on project events, including videos and podcasts of some of the talks. The website, which is hosted by the School of Interdisciplinary Areas Studies of Oxford University, can be found here: http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/presidentialism. A further micro-site dedicated to the project is hosted by the Department of Politics and International Relations of Oxford University, and can be viewed here: http://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/knowledge-exchange-project/the-coalitional-presidentialism-project.html. Project findings were also disseminated via twitter and by posting podcasts to Oxford University's dedicated i-Tunes University profile. Eight video-casts can be accessed through this link: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/id1069819318. 

Many of the publications from the project and speaking engagements of the Investigators have raised the profile of coalitional politics and resulted in requests for more information. Through Paul Chaisty's ties with the Armenian Apella Institute, the findings of the research project fed into public debates surrounding the constitutional reform referendum in Armenia in late 2015. He also raised the profile of the issue in Russia through the influential Institute for Law and Public Policy, which acts as an interface between academic and Russian lawyers and policy makers. 

In some cases, policy engagement has led prominent policy making bodies to amend their approach in line with the project's findings. For example, research talks delivered individually by Tim Power, Nic Cheeseman and Paul Chaisty to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy (WFD) - the UK's leading democracy promotion organization funded by DFID and the FCO - led the organization to give greater space to thinking through the potential impact of presidential coalitions on its legislative strengthening programmes. 

At the same time, the expertise that the Investigators amassed on executive-legislative relations around the world during the research project led the WFD to approach Nic Cheeseman to be the Principal Investigator for a programme on the Political Economy of Democracy Promotion that has a heavy focus on legislative development. This programme now employs a full time post-doc, hosted at the University of Oxford but funded by the WFD with money secured from DFID, and is soon to publish its first policy paper on legislative strengthening.

Our cross-national statistical research shows that political fragmentation (a rise in the number of parties in parliament) is increasing across all types of political systems, whether presidential, semipresidential or parliamentary. The number of coalitional presidential democracies is expected to rise in the future, making the findings of the project critical for understanding of this new subtype of regime.

2. There are notable cross-regional differences in the specific tools used by presidents to manage their interparty coalitions. In Latin America, presidents rely more heavily on formal legislative powers; in Africa, on informal institutions such as the exchange of favours; and in the former Soviet Union, there is a mixture of these two strategies.

3. Elected legislators in the nine countries recognise coalitional presidentialism as a viable solution to governability pressures in executive-legislative relations, yet at the same time they are often critical of the costs of presidential empowerment.

4. Presidents face strong temporal pressures in coalition management. As their term in office elapses, they become notably more willing to surrender cabinet representation to allied parties in order to maintain the integrity of the coalition. This allows them to remain in office but at the expense of policy influence.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project findings have already been disseminated to academic and policy beneficiaries in a number of different ways as envisaged in the Pathways to Impact statement:

1. A project website was created to host and disseminate key information including publications, policy briefs and research reports: http://users.ox.ac.uk/~latc0045/CPP/News_%26_Events.html
2. Major dissemination events were held in Brazil (5 events in different cities), France, Kenya, the UK, Spain, Ukraine and Russia, with mixed audiences of academics, donor representatives, and local stakeholders. 
3. A clearly written and accessible project research report was produced, translated into Armenian, French, Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Ukrainian, and is now being disseminated via email and the project website.
4. Policy briefs tailored to the needs a policy audience were prepared on new coalition governments in Brazil and Ukraine, which were circulated via email and the website.
5. Five journal articles have been published in Democratization, Post-Soviet Affairs, Russian Analytical Digest, Europe-Asia Studies and East European Politics. The Democratization article has been widely read and cited, after it won the GIGA Award for the best article in Comparative Area Studies 2014.

Further impact strategies include:

1. The three Co-Investigators are currently preparing a book manuscript and several more journal articles in order to share the findings of the project with a broader academic audience.
2. The Co-Investigators have a standing invitation to present the final research findings to policy makers within the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the UK government. We hope that this may lead to a collaborative project on the impact of coalitional government on democracy and accountability in the three regions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>704A2D96-1C54-42F3-B22F-0B35669F50E9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.area-studies.ox.ac.uk/presidentialism</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This collection brings together data from the Coalitional Presidentialism Project, which ran at the University of Oxford from 2011-2015.
