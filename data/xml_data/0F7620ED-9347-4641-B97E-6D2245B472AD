Immigration Campaigns</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L008971/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In July 2013, the UK Home Office launched a series of high-profile interventions aimed at directing public attention to an increasing 'hard line' from the government in controlling 'illegal immigration'. The urgency of this proposal is to study the operation, impacts and implications of two elements of this: an advertising campaign which began in selected London boroughs calling on migrants with insecure legal status to 'go home'; and a series of high-profile immigration checks and raids in public spaces in super-diverse areas, particularly in London. The 'go home' advertising in public spaces has, since the instigation of this urgent bid, been subject to successful legal challenge for failing to consider its impact on 'good relations' in line with the Equality Act 2010. However, similar publicity has been used by the Home Office inside immigration centres in Glasgow and Hounslow. These developments demonstrate the fast-moving nature of this subject of study and the need for real-time research to capture data and for analysis now, and create an archive for future research.

The summer's wave of interventions is part of wider structural change to the immigration service and policies restricting non-EU citizens' entry to the UK, and their rights once present. They have drawn public attention and campaigns in an acute way which needs urgent attention, particularly with the Immigration Bill being introduced to Parliament this autumn. Debate on migration and borders will continue with the Scottish Independence Referendum in September 2014, and the general election in May 2015. We need to understand the impacts of such policies and public debate on: migrants (both 'legal' and 'illegal'); racially minoritised British citizens if subject to increased harassment; public opinion about migration; community cohesion and good community relations; and political mobilisations. 

Immigration is an issue where economists have been influential on British government policy. However, there is a supposed mismatch between their views and those of the general public. Illegal immigration is not statistically very large, nor very costly; but sentiments on it are held very deeply by certain voters. This raises questions about the use of evidence and argument in public policy decision-making. Policy makers and organisations working with migrants, against racial harassment, and on promoting peaceful communities need research which analyses the effects of these policies. 

The Home Office initially promoted these campaigns through both mainstream and social media (particularly their #immigrationoffenders hashtag on Twitter). Similar means have been used by those protesting against the interventions (notably through #racistvan and #gohome hashtags on Twitter). The combination of online and print media campaigns, and in-person interactions have been significant in both the original interventions and campaigns against them. For example, advice on migration rights has been circulated online then distributed in person, disruptions of immigration checks have been organised online and/or filmed for circulation through social media. These interactions are an important element of the situation we will study, by engaging both with policy makers planning such campaigns and with activists mobilising to support migrants and good relations. An inventive combination of techniques of on-line, textual and visual analysis together with interviews and participant observation will help us to capture the multiple arenas of unfolding events. This research has been designed in collaboration with civil society organisations which have been clear about their needs for robust social scientific evidence that will help them and others to effectively foster good relations. The research design is based on needs identified by these groups and will also provide insights into wider questions of how public policy decisions are made and interact with public debate and social science</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beneficiaries include:
CAMPAIGNING &amp;amp; ADVOCACY GROUPS SUPPORTING MIGRANTS: Knowledge that can assist clients in accessing rights &amp;amp; contribute to wider campaigning to advocate for migrants' rights
RESIDENTS OF ETHNICALLY DIVERSE AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT MIGRANT POPULATIONS: Opportunities to have views &amp;amp; experiences documented in evidence about the impact of enforcement campaigns; evidence that can be used to challenge adverse impacts of such campaigns
EQUALITY &amp;amp; HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION: Evidence of impact of enforcement campaigns on minority groups that can assist in ensuring compliance with equality &amp;amp; human rights obligations
LEGAL ADVISERS: Evidence of how enforcement campaigns may infringe rights of those targeted, which may assist with legal challenge to such infringement
POLICY MAKERS IN IMMIGRATION: Knowledge of unforeseen consequences of enforcement campaigns, including impact on UK &amp;amp; EU citizens, social cohesion &amp;amp; community relations
RESEARCHERS: Knowledge that expands debate in migration studies &amp;amp; emergency research methodologies
See 'Pathways to Impact' and 'Project Partners' for specific groups already engaged.

The project will involve users &amp;amp; potential users at all stages of the research, including through:
- involving advocacy groups as research partners;
- an advisory group for the project bringing together practitioners &amp;amp; researchers;
- opportunities for those affected by Home Office campaigns to respond to interim findings &amp;amp; feed into further development of the project

The project will generate knowledge to enhance the work of advocacy &amp;amp; campaigning groups, through a more nuanced understanding of immigration policy &amp;amp; its impact. 

The project provides opportunities for groups whose voices are rarely included in immigration debates to be recognised as social actors who also participate in such debates. This new knowledge of the impact of immigration policy on all residents in targeted areas promises conceptual impact by expanding understanding of who is affected by immigration policy &amp;amp; enforcement, &amp;amp; the wider social consequences of such tactics. This aspect of the research will enable us to identify possible government failures to meet obligations under equality &amp;amp; human rights legislation &amp;amp; to suggest methods of avoiding negative &amp;amp; unlawful impacts arising from these approaches to immigration enforcement. The project will produce knowledge that will assist bodies charged with ensuring compliance with equality &amp;amp; human rights legislation. An initial report from the pilot phase is being submitted to the EHRC.

The project seeks to unsettle &amp;amp; expand understandings of who 'counts' as a user of publicly-funded research. There will be opportunities for research users to comment on the formulation &amp;amp; dissemination of official &amp;amp; popular knowledge about immigration &amp;amp; the impact of different approaches to research &amp;amp; dissemination on the well-being of diverse communities. 

RELATIONSHIPS WITH ESTABLISHED NETWORKS
We have active partnership arrangements with campaigning &amp;amp; advocacy groups including GRAMNET, Migrant Voice, Runnymede Trust, Scottish Refugee Council Rfugee Action (see 'Pathways to Impact' and 'Project Partners'). Each group convenes a network of users &amp;amp; supporters and has national lobbying power. They form an integral component of the research &amp;amp; dissemination. Specialist staff at Warwick &amp;amp; in partner organisations will support media work.

Interim findings will be discussed in open meetings &amp;amp; focus groups with representatives of advocacy groups &amp;amp; their clients. Feedback from these meetings will be used to refine &amp;amp; develop further stages of research.

LANGUAGE
An important impact of the project is to enable those targeted by Home Office campaigns (due to neighbourhood of residence, immigration status or perceived ethnicity) to comment &amp;amp; reflect on such campaigns. This will include voices of speakers of other languages, with translation accessed through the project's community partners.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>159129</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A participatory installation.

An engaged debate followed, from an audience including practitioners, policymakers, academics, campaigners and volunteers, both migrant and non-migrant. Many people suggested practical ways in which the findings could be useful to them, including the use of the short film we produced and shared at the event.

We asked participants to respond in writing to the question 'What one idea or action will you take away from today's discussion?'. Some of the responses were:
- Alternative ways of communicating research and campaigning to engage people
- Every tool for campaigning should be used
- Link African Forum Glasgow with Positive Action in Housing
- Deeper consideration and value of the purpose and value of research and of the effects of campaign strategies
- The buzz, energy and fantastic results that can come from an effective partnership between academics and grassroots activism! 
- Research is essential, and necessary to include activism and humour to go with it. Always speak out, take risks.
- Thank you for your research, will help us make our case stronger
- Step forward to make more stronger ways of campaigns, using research and film as a combination of methodologies to reach people to change their minds and open their hearts. Teaching anti-immigration, anti-racism, move from hate to love.
- The role of documentation and creating a network among diverse organisations seems a vital role to resourcing and sustaining these campaigns and something academics/institutions can do.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eventbrite.com/e/mapping-immigration-controversy-research-briefing-tickets-16314468013</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Woman's Hour coverage</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC67B50E-9842-42CA-B202-1572066A0480</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Following our press release and a direct approach to BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour, an item was broadcast discussing the findings of our research.

Doing Sociology: Researching #racistvan

It is mid-July 2013. The schools have broken up for the summer. The birth of a royal baby, the son of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, occupies media attention. The first 'Go Home' vans are spotted in London. The vans were part of the launch of a Home Office pilot scheme called Operation Vaken, targeted at 'illegal immigrants'. Immigration enforcement officers appeared at train and tube stations and asked certain commuters about their immigration status, places of work were raided to arrest people who were in the country illegally. Social media whirled with wry commentary from all points of view. Images of the vans were soon accompanied by the hashtag #RacistVan. Some people think that the vans are the work of right-wing groups. Others feel that the vans are not big enough to deal with all the 'illegal immigrants' who are driving down wages and placing a huge strain on welfare services. It's a 'national' health service isn't it? The Advertising Standards Authority received 224 complaints about the Go Home vans, including from groups representing migrants and refugees in the UK, law scholars and the Labour peer Lord Lipsey. 

Matters of who belongs and how are critical to sociology, touching on all aspects of social life - education, work, housing, the family and criminalisation. The events that unfolded around Operation Vaken marked the beginning of a joint sociological research project 'Mapping Immigration Controversies' carried out in British cities, including London, Glasgow and Cardiff. The researchers worked in partnership with community organisations, commissioned a national survey and interviewed local residents and policy makers. In this session two of the sociologists who were involved in the research will talk about the project, showing examples of what sociologists do.

In preparation of the lecture, please watch this short Youtube film about the project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItuIdhdaPP4

There is also a project website which includes a blog about the research - www.mappingimmigrationcontroversy.com

Before you come to the conference discuss and think about the following questions:

In what ways does the research relate to any of the topics you are studying?
Should sociology get involved with such controversial issues?
If you were a researcher on the project how might you do the research with those in your school or college? What would you try to find out? What methods would you use and why?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog piece for Policy Scotland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3AAF9132-6463-4BB0-A8C9-7FB4193C613B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Raised awareness of project and questions we are raising

The research questions and research design were developed with direct involvement from migrant support organisations and national civil rights groups. The process of carrying out the research involved local community organisations, and so the very process of research has helped to develop research-mindedness beyond the traditional academic community. 

Through a large number of engagement events (see 'Engagement Activities') - in a variety of formats and locations, throughout the life of the project - research participants, research users and researchers were brought together, not only to share findings but to input into analysis and development. This has helped to demonstrate the relevance of our research to users beyond the university (local community groups, national policy organisations, campaign groups, educators, national policy makers, national and local politicians, activists, journalists, asylum seekers, residents in areas of study). We have gathered a wide variety of written evidence of impact from these events, including statements that the findings would be used to develop new campaigning strategies, as a model for future research, and in educational activities in schools and colleges.

Our findings are already being used within the community sector, including organisations that both provide services and campaign for migrant rights. The findings are used both to shape work and inform debate, and campaigning work. Written evidence of this from such groups can be provided. 

Our website, films, online resources and social media engagement based on our research have been viewed and used widely (see statistics under entry in 'Engagement Activities'). We have also had a variety of press coverage of our findings. While this might be considered 'dissemination' rather than 'impact', a key intention of our research and impact planning was that both the process and findings would inform and shape public debate. The data on our involvement in public debate in these various formats, and responses to this involvement, suggest this is an impact on public debate which involves active shaping of discussion, not simply dissemination (e.g. our work to include discussion of the effects of immigration control on women, in the Women's Hour piece listed under 'Engagement Activities').</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2C228832-FDFC-4B30-A88B-2F10EE672F0E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>HEADLINE FINDING

Government publicity campaigns that demonstrate 'toughness' on immigration cause a significant minority of people to become more worried about irregular migration. This includes people who are scared that they are being targeted - both migrants and British citizens - and people who are worried that migration is 'out of control'.

Ten key findings from our research

1. We found no evidence that government communications about immigration and enforcement are based on research about 'what works' in managing immigration. The only research evidence policy makers mentioned to us was privately commissioned research on managing public opinion about immigration, particularly among those worried that immigration is 'out of control'. Yet our research suggests the tactics used on this basis can increase fear and anxiety.
2. Government campaigns on immigration provoked or increased anger and fear, among irregular migrants, regular migrants, and non-migrants, including people opposed to immigration. The latter told us they that the government campaigns were ineffective 'theatre'.
3. For people who were the subjects of immigration campaigns (or felt under threat from them), talking about the publicity campaigns often led them to think about their own experiences of immigration enforcement and feelings of fear and anxiety. Our research focused on communications campaigns, but participants made direct links to, for example, images of enforcement raids and their own experiences of immigration enforcement in their homes.
4. Hard-hitting government publicity on immigration seemed to provoke new waves of pro-migrant activism. Anger and outrage was translated into online and street-based activism, including of people who had not been engaged in activism before.
5. Some, but not all, activism has been migrant-led, and we identified inequalities in who felt able to take part in political debate because of real or perceived threats to their residency status as a result.
6. Traditional anti-racism campaigns are finding it hard to keep up with changes in the focus of hostility and discrimination, for example with how to engage with the status of international students and asylum seekers.
7. Our local case studies demonstrated local variations in how government campaigns were experienced, and the activism that was produced in response. In some places migrants and activists could build on existing infrastructures for political organising. In other places such resources did not exist or had dwindled, or energies were focused on service provision for vulnerable people in an increasingly difficult funding environment.
8. There is not always solidarity between people being targeted by anti-immigration campaigns. We found several instances of hostility between different groups of migrants, often based on an idea that their own group was 'deserving' of residency and status in the UK, while others were 'undeserving'.
9. The different legal statuses that migrants can have is confusing, and for many people in the wider public, the distinctions between 'illegal' and 'legal', and between asylum seeker, refugee, student, worker, resident, and sometimes between migrants and ethnic minority British-born people is difficult to understand. Many people reported harassment for being 'illegal immigrants' when they had settled status, or were British citizens.
10. We heard that many people had come to the UK because of ideals often promoted as 'British values' - such as democracy, the rule of law, individual liberty and mutual respect and tolerance for those with different faiths and beliefs. Their experience since arrival called into doubt the existence of these values in Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are already being used within the community sector, including organisations that both provide services and campaign for migrant rights. The findings are used both to shape work and inform debate, and campaigning work. 

The findings could also be of use to government to inform public-facing work on immigration control. Home Office representatives attended some of our feedback events, and we have shared the findings with government spokespersons, relevant policy organisations, and through a submission to the Home Affairs Committee Migrant Crisis Inquiry. We have also (following an invitation) produced a briefing for the ESRC incorporating material from our main key findings briefing and policy recommendations (https://mappingimmigrationcontroversy.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/esrc-briefing-the-impact-of-immigration-campaigns_tcm8-34760.pdf)

Our website, films and online learning resources produced based on our research will be of use in education and training settings, in terms of methodology as well as substantive findings. Several attendees at events we have held were from further education and campaigning groups and specifically said they would be using our resources in future.

We have a contract with Manchester University Press for a joint-authored monograph based on our findings, which will be produced at an affordable price (&amp;pound;15) and accessible to interested publics as well as academic audiences. We envisage that the format of this book will make it useful in public policy circles both in discussions of migration and community-engaged research methods.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>559913F0-1D5E-4368-914E-28EC1C5CC2AC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://mappingimmigrationcontroversy.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/end-of-project-findings-leaflet-final.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>We commissioned a questions on an Ipsos MORI Capibus survey of c.2000 adults, nationally representative sample, on questions derived from some of our initial qualitative research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>030F2A27-EC19-49C5-9241-78014A860D3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was an integral part of our research, and relevant to our research findings.
