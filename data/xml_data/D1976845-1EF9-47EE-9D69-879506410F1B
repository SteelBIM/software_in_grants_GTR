in reactor physics</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J002011/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal comes at a time when the UK nuclear sector is resurgent. It is now widely accepted that one of the ways in which the UK can meet its commitments to reducing CO2 emissions, as well as dealing with its over-reliance on imported fuel supplies, is to replace the current fleet of ageing nuclear reactors. However, in recent years the UK has seen a substantial reduction in trained scientists and engineers and this skills shortage is now approaching a critical point. Unless immediate action is taken the skilled work force will be too small to oversee safe operation, decommissioning and waste disposal from the current nuclear power facilities, let alone satisfy demand driven by any future new build. In addition, many nuclear related issues also remain unsolved, from new reactor designs to waste disposal, and so increasing our expertise as well as our understanding in nuclear is of great importance. In this proposal we will address many of the main issues by developing novel approaches for radiation transport modelling (RT). This will enhance our understanding across a range of fields from reactor physics, radiation shielding and radiation damage to criticality safety and waste disposal. This will put the UK back at the forefront of RT research. It will also inform policy makers, scientists and engineers involved in energy and environmental initiatives and increase confidence in nuclear safety and waste disposal.
RT modelling has been notoriously difficult. This is partly due to the high complexity of the 7 dimensional phase-space that describes radiation transport, but also the inherent multi-scale geometries within reactor cores are beyond the modelling capabilities of most numerical schemes. Multi-scale, reduced order, and adaptive numerical methods can therefore be extremely valuable to this area of reactor physics. They can link together the numerous length-scales, from the smallest fuel element to the largest fuel arrays, with mathematical rigour whilst forming computationally efficient and fast solutions. The proposed work will realise this potential by developing, for the first time:
1) A full multi-scale model for RT that rigorously links all length scales for reactor physics applications.
2) Embedded reduced order methods that significantly reduce computational complexity by several orders of magnitude through the reduction of large scale models to only a few hundred unknowns.
3) Error estimates that enable adaptive capabilities which can resolve the full 7D phase-space &amp;amp; focus computing resources on resolving the key physics, therefore increasing efficiency without compromising accuracy.
4) Parallel solver technologies for the efficient solution of large scale problems that can be carried out on current &amp;amp; future multi-core computer platforms.
5) Embedded data assimilation methods that link the above technologies with known nuclear data uncertainties to form error bounds on solutions &amp;amp; other key parameters.
This will provide new information on uncertainties, sensitivities &amp;amp; errors resulting from variations in geometry, material data and other input parameters.
Our overall aim of this project is the accurate prediction of RT using a world leading model. The novel technologies including; multi-scale methods, reduced order models, error estimates, adaptivity, data assimilation and parallel solvers will be implemented within our finite element RT model framework RADIANT. By providing a model with advanced numerical technologies that accurately capture intricate geometric detail, combined with estimates of errors and sensitivities, we can enable the user to make informed judgements on a wide range of nuclear applications. This will have wide ranging impacts, e.g. informing government and regulatory bodies, enhancing company and stakeholder capabilities and ensuring that the scientific communities research methodologies are cutting edge. This will serve to increase confidence, mitigate errors and reduce risk.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This work will benefit those scientists, government bodies and industries concerned with nuclear power safety and coupled systems. This includes areas of multi-phase flows, structural models, damage models, geological safety of waste repositories and state-of-the-art computational modelling. Specific organisations that will benefit from these advanced RT technologies include AWE, AREVA, NNL, NDA, HSE, Rolls-Royce and EDF (now running UK nuclear reactors). 

Example benefit areas include: Optimising fuel loading, reactor lifetime extension, and planning for safe decommissioning, this work will also be of interest to wider EPSRC and NERC communities. For the EPSRC community, areas where our work will be of benefit include: plasma physics, imaging, nuclear waste modelling and thermal radiation research (in combustion and furnaces). NERC communities will benefit from this next generation RT technology for research on cloud physics for climate and process study models, spectral wave models for free surface and internal waves in oceans, and RT processes within meteor impacts. The use of our RT technologies for the above listed research themes will advance climate models, earth system science, prediction of natural hazards, and other related technology areas. Many of the techniques and tools we will be working on are also of interest to the wider computational physics community. There is strong potential for their re-application to resolve other physical phenomena using the general adaptive discretisations, data assimilation, multi-scale models and solver technologies. There is also a strong interest in using this software for multi-physics simulations in National Laboratories including those in the USA, France and Japan, where our researchers already have links.

This proposal comes at a time when the UK is in danger of being dominated by overseas commercial software and we are not on a level playing field when contributing to science and engineering in this important area. This proposal will therefore help correct this trend, by providing a modern approach to reactor physics, criticality and shielding applications. This will result in improved safety for new build and decommissioning activities, by providing an independent and improved alternative to vendor codes from France and the USA. This work will therefore play many important roles ranging from informing government policy decisions on energy to addressing the general public's concern regarding nuclear power safety and with safe decommissioning and waste disposal.

The project also has an important economic impact as it will help combat the introduction of commercial software from abroad. At present this is eroding UK software sales and damaging the prospects for growing UK licence sales during the forthcoming era of new build. If allowed to continue it could cost the UK nuclear industry hundreds of thousands of pounds per annum if a competitive UK alternative is not launched soon. This project will also aim to expand and market beyond the UK and seek new business in overseas governmental and industrial bodies, including the US, Japan and Mainland Europe. Our technologies will also make inroads into the main energy hubs, particularly in the US where we already have strong links, and thus increase the project's economic impact on a global scale, improving UK competiveness and revenue flow through increased licence sales abroad.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1159334</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ministry of Defence (MOD)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>MoD, Rolls-Royce and Amec Development of Uncertainty Quantification Algorithms</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7696F13-3A54-4A22-B44E-D030C651165C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main outcome of this collaboration has been the development of new, more accurate uncertainty quantification algorithms for use in reactor physics, nuclear criticality safety and radiation shielding applications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>MoD and Rolls-Royce have provided funding for two PhD/EngD students:

In addition high dimensional model reduction methods uncertainty quantification algorithms have been applied in these fields as well. 

The findings have been used to provide MoD and Rolls-Royce with a next generation radiation transport modelling and simulation framework for naval nuclear submarine reactor physics and radiation shielding assessment embodied in the radiation transport code RADIANT. This will be used by Rolls-Royce to improve the design and efficiency of radiation shields and reactor cores for small modular reactor (SMR) nuclear power plants.

We have also used the findings to help support MoD and Amec Foster Wheeler develop a next generation uncertainty quantification modelling and simulation framework called SPRUCE that can be applied to a wide range of problems in nuclear energy. This will in future help improve the design, safety, reliability and performance of civil and defence nuclear power plants.

We have also helped EDF Energy develop a new suite of multiscale transport solvers in their PANTHER whole core reactor physics code. We have helped forge closer ties with CCFE Culham in the field of deterministic radiation transport and radiation shielding research which will help the fusion community benefit from the research performed during this grant. 

We have also help produce data assimilation methods that have been used by AWE in their publication of historical intermediate enriched nuclear criticality experiments that has now been published in the International Criticality Safety Benchmark Evaluation Programme suite of assessed criticality experiments (ICSBEP). 

In conjunction with AWE and Babcock and Wilcox Technical Services Group we have developed a new generation of reactor kinetics codes for nuclear criticality safety assessment of drums of fissile liquid as well as helping to understand the operational behaviour of novel small modular medical isotope reactors embodied in the MIPS reactor design.

This research has also led to the development of new Cartesian mesh adaptive radiation transport algorithms for use by EDF in Paris, France as well as helping forge close links on nuclear power research and development between the UK and France. 

The findings have also been used to publish twenty one journal publications in prestigious journals which have kept the UK in the forefront of radiation transport algorithm development. 

Also during this time five PhD/EngD students associated with this grant have been awarded their PhDs/EngDs with a further seven have been funded by industry to help support the research aims of the grant and to help continue the research after the grant finishes.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>54A66E80-1447-43AF-89C4-99501580A7F8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The research for this grant has focussed on advanced, adaptive parallel radiation transport algorithm development with uncertainty quantification. Radiation transport is fundamental to wide variety of physics phenomena and engineering disciplines such as reactor physics, nuclear criticality safety assessment and radiation shielding in fission and fusion reactors; nuclear security; cloud radiative transfer in terrestrial/planetary environments (key element of global climate models); radiation heat transfer in industrial furnaces and combustion chambers; radiative transfer in stars and transport of charged particle radiation in semi-conductor devices and medical treatment planning.

We have developed scalable parallel, adaptive radiation transport algorithms that enable engineers and scientists to study these phenomena in much greater detail thus reducing discretisation and model errors whilst enabling detailed parametric uncertainty quantification to be performed. The primary area of application of this high performance numerical algorithms is in reactor physics, nuclear criticality safety assessment and radiation shielding in fission and fusion nuclear power plants. 

The research associated with this grant has led to the following research developments/outputs:

(a) The research led to the further development and enhancement of the high performance, scalable, adaptive radiation transport modelling and simulation platform RADIANT. This is being developed into a commercial product for use by Rolls-Royce civil nuclear and submarines. This has maintained and improved the UK's standing as a world leading country in the field of radiation transport methods development with nuclear professionals from TAMU, Michigan and MIT visiting the group during the grant to see and understand the research being performed. 

(b) The research has led to the development of a reactor kinetics code for the evaluation of nuclear criticality safety as well as reactor start-up dynamics of small modular reactors (SMRs) and the analysis and design of novel medical isotope reactors. The main beneficiaries of this research were AWE, Babcock and Wilcox Technical Services Group and Rolls-Royce.

(c) The research also has led to evaluation and subsequent publishing in the international criticality safety benchmark evaluation project (ICSBEP) handbook of historical intermediate enriched criticality experiments performed at Dounreay and Aldermaston in the 1950's and 1960s. 

(d) Finally, the research led to the development of high dimensional model reduction methods for uncertainty quantification in reactor physics, nuclear criticality safety assessment and radiation shielding. These high performance uncertainty quantification algorithms were incorporated into the MoD, Rolls-Royce and Amec Foster Wheeler code SPRUCE for use in the naval nuclear propulsion programme as well as having civil nuclear applications. This is leading to the adoption of Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) analysis in the nuclear engineering community in the UK. This will help improve the design, safety, performance and reliability of nuclear power plants in the defence and civil nuclear sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Rolls-Royce are one of the main beneficiaries of this research work as they are currently testing and deploying RADIANT within their reactor physics and radiation shielding teams. This code will be used in the modelling and design of advanced radiation shields and reactor cores for small modular reactors (SMRs). 

AWE is another beneficiary as they will make use of the code FISS that my team has developed for fissile liquid criticality safety assessment. They will also benefit from the use of nuclear security modelling and simulation tools were are currently developing. AWE, IAEA, NEA and the international community have also benefitted from the assessment of historical intermediate enriched criticality experiments from Dounreay and Aldermaston in the 1950's and 1960's that have now been included in the international criticality safety benchmark evaluation project (ICSBEP) handbook.

Babcock and Wilcox Technical Services Group have benefitted from the development of advanced reactor kinetics codes for the assessment of the operational stability and safety of their novel medical isotope reactor (MIPS). 

Finally, MoD, Rolls-Royce and Amec Foster Wheeler are benefitting from the advanced uncertainty quantification algorithms we have developed within their SPRUCE uncertainty quantification modelling and simulation framework. This is leading to the early adoption of Best Estimate Plus Uncertainty (BEPU) methodologies in the UK defence and civil nuclear sectors.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>446F15DD-107E-4457-B2EB-7871DEC78CC2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of NIRAB (Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5D5964B-5532-482D-9660-3CEF29599FCC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I assist NIRAB in the only UK academic who is an expert in reactor physics, radiation shielding, integrated methods modelling, nuclear criticality safety assessment.
