It addresses clear knowledge gaps identified by NERC, DEFRA and UKERC in the effects of MREDs on flow conditions, habitats and ecological interactions. It will use a wealth of observation techniques above and under water, ranging from radar to sonar and in situ measurements, to be deployed over 2 years at 3 key sites around the UK. These measurements will feed into models of ecological interactions and habitat preferences, allowing predictions of the multiple effects of large MRED arrays.
Being fully cross-disciplinary, this project will engage different academic beneficiaries at each stage. Researchers in the field of instrument design (in the laboratory and at sea) will benefit from our experience in building the different systems and adapting them to long-term deployments on the seabed, in extremely challenging environments. This will be done by carefully planned Knowledge Exchange activities and open-access publication of our results, as well as exchange of personnel. The avenues opened for continuous imaging of complex and dynamic 3-D structures will be useful to researchers in other fields associated with ecological systems and marine structures, but also in medical 4-D imaging.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>See lead proposal</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>219542</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ICOE 2016 Annex IV Collision Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01E0F9E3-557B-45D1-9F9E-4401CF19465D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aim of this workshop is to identify the key challenges within the consenting process regarding collision risk for marine wildlife with tidal turbines and to produce a coordinated action plan, providing a framework to help reduce risk and uncertainty for developers and regulators</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SNH Sharing Good Practice Dealing with uncertainty in the Marine Environment</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03793BB8-8194-490F-A093-A5D61ABDC03B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Sharing Good Practice Dealing with uncertainty in the Marine Environment - a range of short interactive sessions (and repeat) sessions to explain the potential routes to assessing the impact of renewable developments to industry, NGOs, and other academic disciplines.

This is a focused workshop with a selected group of invited participants from UK Research Councils, Industry,
European and UK Government Advisors &amp;amp; Regulators, Enterprise and Researchers and is the follow on of the
MASTS/ORJIP workshop held in Glasgow, Oct 18, 2016

The aim of this second workshop is 2 fold:

The 1st Aim is entitled Science translation for Industry/Regulators/Funders/Public: How best should the
science communities be presenting new information? Active researchers from the VertlBase project (and more) will
provide brief overviews of current results as examples of science translation. Facilitated and open discussion will be
used to produce agreed methods, and processes to improve science translation between science providers, science
funders and science users.

The 2nd AIM is entitled: Making it Happen: Environmental related research from identification, though
funding to translation to industry and policy. There will be updates from Industry, Funders and advances in the
process of the development of an ORE environmental R&amp;amp;D strategy for the UK. Facilitated worked examples from
multi-disciplinary research identification, to successful funding, through to translation of science will provide the
ingredients for open debate across sectors on the best way forward to implement processes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FLOWBEC: Long-term measurements of the environment around marine renewable energy devices.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB92C76A-F8AB-43ED-999B-E3C2E18D5043</gtr:id><gtr:impact>University of Aberdeen Institute of Energy Industry Meet Event,

interactions and reduce uncertainty around key impacts is of increasing significance.
To date, environmental monitoring methods have been wide ranging and have varied in success,
often reflecting budget availability and operational restrictions around test deployments. There are
however a number of projects that are now installed and operating around the world which have
comprehensive, integrated environmental monitoring programs focused on reducing uncertainty
and risk.
This provides a unique opportunity for strategic collaboration across projects and jurisdictions to
help identify and solve common challenges associated with environmental monitoring and to ensure
that the maximum value can be gained from the data gathered from these initial deployments and
arrays.
Annex IV and the Offshore Renewables Joint Industry Programme for Ocean Energy (ORJIP OE) are
pleased to invite you to an Expert Forum on Environmental Monitoring of Tidal Turbines and
Arrays. We believe that this could grow into an ongoing work group on monitoring to help share
techniques, face off for the ongoing challenges, learn from one another, and create a long-term
platform for knowledge transfer and problem solving.
This forum is planned to introduce the teams currently involved in environmental monitoring around
operational tidal turbines and arrays, as well as those that have completed monitoring surveys. It is
hoped that discussions in this initial expert forum will identify areas that warrant further discussion
in subsequent forum meetings. The forum will be one hour with participants introducing themselves
and their work followed by an open discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://tethys.pnnl.gov/events/expert-forum-environmental-monitoring-around-turbines</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ocean Business 2015 Special Session on MRE</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>714F730C-E7CD-4AED-9ED2-ECA8B7EEE923</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NERC Special Session on Marine Renewable Energy - Update on technology and tools to de risk and streamline development.

The deployment of offshore and marine renewables has sparked a wide range research studies on how they might impact marine processes and life in coastal seas. However, the natural environment and organisms within it can also have impacts on the engineered structures and power take-off potential. These impacts can derive from a wide variety of means ranging from reduced efficiency of moving parts by fouling, through to large animals colliding with and potentially damaging components. Engineering and ecological interactions will also drive the constraints in the level of resource (wind, waves or tidal-streams) available for exploitation. As the renewables sector moves from proof of concepts to site specific realities, then these physical and biological processes will become ever more important. This workshop will bring together engineers, physicists, environmental scientists, developers and regulators to develop mutual understandings of these interactions and explore ways to mitigate challenges and optimise opportunities in this emerging and potentially rewarding topic area. A mixed audience of specialists and non-specialists from different disciplines, including developers and regulators to encourage cross disciplinary understanding and stimulate discussion. A brief report of the workshop will be compiled, capturing key discussion points, highlighting knowledge gaps and identifying potential opportunities for cross disciplinary work to contribute to the development of the sector.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Marine renewable energy extraction, climate change and trophic linkages: What do we need to understand?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>679AC643-7F61-48B8-8E63-3234EFAA83DF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>When we start putting in hundreds of marine renewable devices in large arrays of areas of &amp;gt;10 km2, then we will start to change something fundamental in the marine environment: the level of physical mixing. The marine environment is less variable, more predictable than the terrestrial environment and hence most marine species rely on the predictability of daily, biweekly and seasonal currents and local levels of mixing to drive their foraging and reproducing behaviours. In order to safely design and deploy large renewable developments we need to understand how mobile predators, fish, seabirds and mammals use the predictability of ocean environments to successfully forage. To understand the ecological effects of marine renewable developments we must shift the focus of research form the distributions of species onto a more fundamentally mechanistic and hypothesis driven understanding of reasons for specific areas of high foraging activity. 



This talk will cover 3 main issues, using data from our empirical and modelling research, to explore the effects of renewable energy extraction influencing mobile predator foraging: 1) identifying reasons for locations of, and the potential mechanisms producing predictable foraging areas, 2) the knowledge gained on foraging habitat use by understanding the limits of foraging energy expenditure and 3) the need to explore in detail underwater foraging behaviour. The presentation will cover new surveys techniques including the collection of continuous data over a full spring-neap cycle via a combination of two upward facing sonar systems: multi-frequency and multibeam devices. These systems collected data on diving seabirds, fish species and turbulence, imaging a full `acoustic curtain' along the tidal flow in a highly challenging environment from a seabed frame placed within 25 m of an OpenHydro tidal turbine structure at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) tidal test site in Scotland, UK.

The FLOWBEC platform combined several instruments to track the behaviour, distribution, depth preference and interactions of birds, fish schools and marine mammals with marine renewable energy devices to reveal how animals forage within dynamic marine habitats and whether individuals face collision risks. Five 2-week deployments were completed in 2012 and 2013 at wave and tidal energy sites, both in the presence and absence of renewable energy structures at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC), Orkney, UK. These results are being used to assess collision risk and to guide marine spatial planning, device design, licensing and operation, as different device types are tested, as individual devices are scaled up to arrays, and as new sites are considered. This accurate and quantitative information can be used de-risk the licensing process and, with a greater mechanistic understanding at demonstration scales, its predictive power could reduce the monitoring required at commercial sites.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The platform design, algorithm development, and analysis techniques can be applied to other marine renewable energy sites or devices. Research outputs from the FLOWBEC-4D project are now being used to inform the environmental monitoring programme for MeyGen, one of the world's first tidal turbine arrays, currently being constructed in the Pentland Firth Inner Sound, Scotland. Collaborative instrument development is also underway with colleagues at the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center (USA).
The research findings can also be used for comparisons between marine renewable energy sites, to investigate requirements for site-specific monitoring or any generalities which may facilitate generic environmental monitoring programmes. A comparison between Admiralty Inlet (USA), Fall of Warness (UK) and Pentland Firth Inner Sound (UK) is currently underway.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>501B5949-F8D8-4EA0-92D2-C13C71E68E57</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://noc.ac.uk/project/flowbec</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Material used in Invited presentation to European Marine Board</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F71B0A5-DED8-45E1-AEB6-99FFA571136B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>DEFRA Workshop: Foresight Future of the sea</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>20AC12F6-DFA8-4FB7-BD2A-D1BFE164C556</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The FLOWBEC-4D (Flow, Water column &amp;amp; Benthic Ecology 4D) project developed a seabed instrument platform to investigate the environmental and ecological effects of installing and operating wave and tidal energy devices. The FLOWBEC platform combined several instruments to track the behaviour, distribution, depth preference and interactions of birds, fish schools and marine mammals with marine renewable energy devices to reveal how animals forage within dynamic marine habitats and whether individuals face collision risks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE50520C-FD00-46F0-9173-716E6DBED18F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The platform design, algorithm development, and analysis techniques can be applied to other marine renewable energy sites or devices. Research outputs from the FLOWBEC-4D project are now being used to inform the environmental monitoring programme for MeyGen, one of the world's first tidal turbine arrays, currently being constructed in the Pentland Firth Inner Sound, Scotland.
