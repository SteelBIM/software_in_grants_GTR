They also have played a key role demonstrating the importance of public opinion in foreign policy-making.&amp;nbsp; Emphasising the effects of public opinion on foreign policy constitutes a major departure from the past. Traditionally, commentators discounted the impact of public opinion in this area, arguing foreign policy-making is largely elite-driven (eg, Allison, 1972; Ashford, 1981; Peters, 1986). However, over the past decade, there has been increasing awareness that public opinion matters (eg, Gelpi, Feaver and Reifler 2009). Very recently, the decisions by Prime Minister Cameron and President Obama to take the question of military intervention in Syria to their respective legislatures illustrate that public attitudes are now a consequential force shaping foreign policy-making in Britain and elsewhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The proposed research investigates factors affecting public opinion about foreign policy by studying the dynamics of opinion about possible military and humanitarian aid interventions in Syria in three major democracies - Great Britain, the United States and France.&amp;nbsp; he Syrian situation has great real-world urgency while presenting a significant opportunity to bolster understanding of how public opinion shapes and constrains the policies that elites can choose.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal is written as Britain appears to have ruled out the use of military force against Syria, but France and the US have reserved the right to use the military. Although the UK has ruled out using military force, the Government is mounting the nation's largest humanitarian relief effort in its history. To date, over &amp;pound;500 million has been committed to the cause of assisting Syrian civilians. The success or failure of this effort may shape the public's perceptions of the utility of aid commitments in the future. 

The applicants are in contact with officials from the Department for International Development (DFID), who are interested in the public's perceptions of the British aid effort and how these perceptions are different from those in France and the United States. DFID is also concerned about the public's engagement with the UK aid campaign, and the possibilities that the large UK aid commitment will not be enough as winter conditions come to the conflict ridden region. DFID currently does not have a budget to undertake survey research, and the applicants have agreed to ask questions concerning the utility and efficacy of foreign aid DFID last fielded in 2010 (the questions also are of direct relevance to academic researchers). DFID will have input into questions concerning citizen perceptions of the efficacy and fairness of the UK's (and that of the US and France) aid commitment vis-&amp;agrave;-vis the pledges made by other G8 nations.

Aside from civil servants at DFID, officials from the Home and Foreign and Commonwealth Offices have been engaged with findings from PI Scotto and co-PI Reifler's previous work on public opinion and foreign policy and engagement will continue with this project. If military options are placed back on the table by one or more of the three countries or should the monitoring of Syria's chemical weapons stockpiles fail, public opinion about the conflict may shift suddenly. The surveys designed will be designed to capture public mo following a change in the situation on the ground and results will be analysed and passed along to government bodies on short notice. Throughout the life of the project, practitioners will be presented with a series of accessible reports or &amp;quot;policy papers&amp;quot; that delineate the distribution of foreign policy attitudes both within and across the three nations. 
Professor Paul Whiteley has contacts with many UK government and parliamentary officials, and they will be engaged. The applicants are willing to present results before Select Committees and All Party Groups in the Houses of Commons and Lords. Co-Investigators Reifler and Clarke will seek out partners in the US, both those who may be interested in the results of the surveys (e.g.;the Brookings Institution) and those who may wish to partner with the applicants to fund additional waves (e.g., the Gates Foundation).

The applicants are interested and open to receiving inputs from other practitioners on the content of the planned surveys and experiments. Data from the applicants' surveys will be made publicly available via the UK Data Archive.

This project will have a dedicated webpage that will feature drafts of the planned surveys, initial releases of the data, and interactive features such as a project related blog where press releases will be issued and open for public comment. 

Findings from the research will be discussed at a conference to be held at a dissemination event co-sponsored by the Foreign Policy Centre in Westminster after the first waves of survey data are collected and analysed. Video footage from this conference will be available in the form of a &amp;quot;vodcast&amp;quot; on the project related web-page.

In engaging practitioners and interested members of the public, the applicant will have support from a Web Support Officer, and Departmental and University of Essex and Exeter staffs. The need for this support has been included in the proposed budget.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>183451</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>British response to the death of King Abdullah--LBC Radio Interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>52ACDAE2-7E69-4371-B095-06951F6A48F3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Radio interview on potential public reaction to flying flags at half staff in reaction to the death of Saudi royalty

Although the UK political landscape has changed enormously since 1990, the popular sentiments that underpinned Margaret Thatcher's repeated electoral successes remain remarkably strong among British voters today. Using extensive survey evidence, Professor David Sanders will characterise what authoritarian populism means for voters in Britain today.
The analysis shows that there is a coherent set of beliefs - from cynicism about the EU to a virulent opposition to human rights - held by a surprisingly large proportion of the UK electorate, which can reasonably be described as authoritarian populist. These views have important consequences, not only for (dis)satisfaction with British democracy but for likely voting in the forthcoming referendum on the EU.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.essex.ac.uk/events/event.aspx?e_id=10102</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk to German Diplomats in Training about Public Opinion and Foreign Policy</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83274EFB-D973-40AA-B1E1-975F0ADE1306</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A Discussion of Measuring German and British Public Opinion to German Diplomat Trainees at the Colchester English Language School</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> Around 50% 'hold authoritarian views'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4334FCEE-787B-41C4-92D8-3FCEE7B013D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Long interview by PI of Residents of Colchester concerning immigration attitudes on the eve of the EU Referendum.

The Gates Foundation, a major private contributor to development aid, also has expressed interest in the substantive results of the surveys. Questions have been placed on surveys and will be placed on the next round of surveys in response to suggestions from Government agencies and NGOs.

The surveys, particularly as they inform responses to the situation in the Middle East, have attracted particular attention of the media and investigators make regular appearances on major media outlets such as the BBC.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BFCAFB61-9203-4272-8D42-5EFD11BA5FC5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The grant concluded in December 2014. Initially awarded specifically for studying the response to the Syrian crisis, the applicants fielded what was perhaps the most extensive study of public attitudes towards foreign aid in the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Key findings:
1) Respondents in all three nations see a moral cause for giving aid; however, there is widespread belief that aid is not effectively used and there is much wastage and corruption in aid dispersal. Researchers, government bodies, and NGOs wishing to reverse beliefs that foreign aid should be curtailed must focus on aid efficiency and effectiveness.
2) Targets of foreign aid matter-those with different ideological outlooks will be sceptical if told aid is provided to foreign governments rather than the people in need.
3) Scepticism surrounding national identity (e.g. Scottish Nationalism, France and Britain's position in the European Union) is correlated with attitudes towards aid. Respondents feel for those affected by the conflict in Syria but are not greatly disposed towards their nation accepting refugees from the conflict. Moreover, respondents at least partially base their acceptance of refugees on information concerning how little (France) or much (Germany) is doing in terms of accepting refugees.
4) The amount of foreign aid the nations were providing in general or as a percentage of national budgets was seen as too much to a clear majority of respondents. Aid is a tough sell
5) The timing of the urgency grant and fielding of the surveys coincided with the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine. As a consequence, the investigators were able to establish that the public was divided in terms of doing nothing and imposing sanctions on Russia for its takeover of Crimea. Few were willing to see the conflict escalate to the point where the nations took military action against Russia.
6) A successful and efficient bidding process allowed the investigators to fund a short post-European election wave; these surveys capture the Euro scepticism displayed by many British voters as they went to the polls in late May 2014. A paper on the topic is in the works and will be presented at the Political Studies Association Conference next year.
Additional American surveys were fielded due to a successful bid to the National Science Foundation made by co-investigator Harold Clarke. This will allow for additional waves that measure foreign policy attitudes to be fielded in conjunction with American elections. As detailed in the narrative impact section, results from this project have been provided to representatives from DFID and the Gates Foundation.

Data have been placed on deposit at the UKDA.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings from the project have been presented to representatives from DFID and the Gates Foundation. The key finding that respondents across the three nations studied see a moral case for aid but do not agree that money is put to good use is something that can be taken on board in public relations and advertising materials put forth by aid agencies and NGOs. The investigators have suggested to the donor agencies that emphasis be placed on aid effectiveness and emphasise that the money is getting to those who need it the most. In short, findings from these surveys inform how messages concerning foreign aid contributions should be framed to taxpayers in donor countries.
Outreach is ongoing and the agencies have been invited to propose topics for the last round of grant funded surveys that will be fielded in late 2014. Principal Investigator Scotto is a member of the advanced impact project of the Global Uncertainties Programme, and Co-Investigator Clarke has extensive links with the Gates Foundation. These provide exceptional avenues for findings to be taken forward.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0772C59C-4A5E-4D8A-AE36-A8164FCC3EC2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.thomasjscotto.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/60EF4B88-1E59-4917-9D0F-036BB88DD2CC"><gtr:id>60EF4B88-1E59-4917-9D0F-036BB88DD2CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Prudence, Principle and Minimal Heuristics: British Public Opinion toward the Use of Military Force in Afghanistan and Libya</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>The British Journal of Politics and International Relations</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08aa87b3b180158cb83659549461bd74"><gtr:id>08aa87b3b180158cb83659549461bd74</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Reifler J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6F4FB1BB-AD8A-4212-8AE0-AB5A06A5BF98"><gtr:id>6F4FB1BB-AD8A-4212-8AE0-AB5A06A5BF98</gtr:id><gtr:title>'Should We Stay or Should We Go?
