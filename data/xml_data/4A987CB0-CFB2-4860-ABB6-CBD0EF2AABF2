&lt;ol> 
 &lt;li>to reposition and broaden the so-called ?business case? for WLB through a mutual gains approach that examines employees? social needs beyond the workplace - as parents and citizens - alongside the economic competitiveness requirements of firms; &lt;/li>
 &lt;li>to improve our understanding of the impacts of, and mechanisms through which, different WLB polices and practices shape the learning and innovation processes underpinning firms? abilities to compete in the knowledge economy; and &lt;/li>
 &lt;li>to examine the role of different regional institutional frameworks in conditioning the impact of WLB provision on firms? socio-economic performance in regional industrial systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol> 
&lt;p>The project employs a multi-method approach based on regional scale surveys, in-depth interviews and group discussions, triangulated with secondary data at a range of scales. Overall, the research contributes to ongoing inter-disciplinary debates on the future of work and socially-sustainable regional competitiveness and is being undertaken in consultation with the following end-users in the policy community: TUC, Amicus, and the East of England Development Agency; and in Ireland: the Work-Life Balance Network, and Irish Congress of Trade Unions.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2006-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-04-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3394</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Work-life conflict, recession and the gendered limits to learning.

'new economy' continue to be widely debated. As firms reorganise work and seek to minimise labour 

costs in the recessionary context, 'flexibility' for many workers has come to mean increased workloads, 

less predictable schedules, and more unsocial work hours. Household life has also become more 

complex with more dual earner and lone-parent households, decline of the extended family, and 

greater eldercare responsibilities in the context of increased life expectancy. Simultaneously, the 

neoliberal attack on social provisioning has transferred the burden of care down to the 'natural' level 

of home where most women retain major responsibility for the everyday activities of social 

reproduction. The overall result is an ongoing, complex, gendered, multi-variable balancing act 

between the competing demands of paid work and responsibilities, commitments and life interests 

beyond the workplace, for which workers have only finite time and energy.

As the neoliberal attack on social provisioning has transferred the burden of care down to the 'natural' level of home where most women retain the major responsibility for the 'messy and fleshy' components of domestic and family life, significant gender variations in work-life stress persist. Studies have highlighted, therefore, the importance of employer provided 'work-life balance' (WLB) arrangements as a means for improving gender equity in market employment and household caring, and for combating the increasing work pressures that are destabilising many households and communities. Yet despite the profound moral and social significance of WLB, it is increasingly recognised that employers are unlikely to implement meaningful WLB arrangements unless they can identify 'bottom-line' economic advantages that arise from their implementation. However, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support the so-called 'WLB business case'. At the same time, conventional WLB business case analyses often sideline social equity concerns of workers and their families, and in their focus on revealed output measures of firm performance, say little about the underlying determinants of firms' competitive performance in the New Economy. 



In response, this paper presents new empirical evidence from two high tech regional economies (Dublin and Cambridge) to develop an alternative socioeconomic analysis focused on: (i) gendered experiences of work-life conflict in the IT industry; (ii) the arrangements that different groups of IT workers and their families find most useful in ameliorating those work-life conflicts; and (iii) the mechanisms through which workers' use of those preferred WLB arrangements helps foster and support routine learning and innovation processes within knowledge-intensive firms.
