This behaviour - imitation - is important for social interaction and learning new skills, but it can also have undesirable effects, for example copying antisocial behaviour.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Imitation is thought to rely on &amp;quot;mirror&amp;quot; neurons, which are cells in the brain that are active when we perform an action and also when we see someone else perform the same action. This research project investigates both imitation behaviour and the responses of mirror neuron areas in the brain, using behavioural and neuroscientific methods (functional magnetic resonance imaging and transcranial magnetic stimulation). The project has two aims:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>is to understand how we acquire the ability to imitate other people&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>is to investigate how the brain controls imitative behaviour, and how the ability to control imitation is affected by context - for example, when people feel part of a social group.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The outcomes of the research could help design training methods for people who have trouble imitating (such as people with autism), or to improve imitation learning of skills, sports, or dance. It also has implications for understanding - and perhaps for influencing - people's imitative behaviour in group situations. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?

One set of beneficiaries of the research in Theme 1 are practitioners who use interventions based on action observation or imitation training. For example this could be in the rehabilitation of stroke patients; in the treatment of patients with syndromes such as complex regional pain syndrome in which sensorimotor functioning is impaired; or to improve social interaction in autism spectrum conditions.

The research in Theme 2 is more theoretical at this stage, but may ultimately inform policy where imitative group behaviour is concerned. These impacts will therefore be more long-term. Potential beneficiaries will be policy makers in a diverse range of fields where the effects of group membership on behaviour are of interest. This could include policy makers interested in the behaviour of large groups in public order situations, or those working in the areas of health behaviours or in food choice, for example. Other groups who may be interested in the long-term impact of the research in Theme 2 include advertising and marketing professionals who may be seeking new ways to influence consumer behaviour, and for whom imitative group behaviour is of interest from an economic perspective.

How will they benefit from this research?

Theme 1 will benefit practitioners who work in the various different areas of clinical intervention detailed above, by providing theory-based evidence for the best way to apply imitation training in order to improve shared action representations. Imitation training is already used as an intervention in some of these conditions, e.g. to improve social outcomes in autism spectrum conditions; the research in Theme 1 will allow practitioners to design more effective interventions with a strong theoretical and empirical basis. More efficient interventions should be more cost-effective and less time-consuming, leading to benefits for patients and savings for health care providers in the medium- to long-term.

The research in Theme 2 will benefit policy makers and others interested in the effects of group membership on imitative behaviour. The research should lead to a greater understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the control of imitative behaviour. It will also clarify the effect on imitative control of manipulations such as emphasising individuality. In the long term this will lead to more effective policies for controlling unwanted imitative behaviour, which may be applied across a range of different areas. It may also lead to more effective ways of manipulating imitative behaviour in a consumer setting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>171866</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Turin (Universit? degli Studi di Torino UNITO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Italy, Italian Republic</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Psychology</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with University of Turin</gtr:description><gtr:id>3FC7AE05-43E2-4AC3-BEF2-751E687092BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Cavallo, A., Catmur, C., Sowden, S., Iani, F., &amp;amp; Becchio, C.

It is particularly likely to lead to improved quality of life in the area of mental health.

The main impact of my findings on the effects of sensorimotor training on mirror neurons, imitation, and social interaction, is that they have encouraged practitioners in various fields related to education and mental health to think about mirror neurons' properties as being malleable rather than fixed. This should open up new possibilities regarding interventions to improve social functioning. 

Such interventions have already been proposed, explicitly based on my research: for example, the use of sensorimotor training and experience in autism spectrum disorder and also in dance (Shaughnessy, in Reynolds and Reason: Kinesthetic Empathy). These findings have also led to impact in fields as diverse as cognitive development and leadership coaching (McGonigle-Chalmers, Understanding Cognitive Development; Bossons, The Neuroscience of Leadership Coaching). I have been personally involved in ensuring the impact of this research in the area of special education, through a partnership with a consortium of special schools. I have had regular meetings with the headteachers and special education coordinators from these schools to explain the relevance of my research to social functioning and to encourage the use of sensorimotor-related interventions in the classroom. I have been involved in two research bids in conjunction with these schools in order to try to obtain further funding to test the efficacy of sensorimotor-related interventions in special education.
My findings have also been applied in the field of rehabilitation, with practitioners using these findings to help patients recovering after stroke and other types of injury.

The second aspect of my findings, on the neural mechanisms that contribute to controlling imitation, has also generated considerable interest in the field of mental health, in particular for the treatment of conditions including schizophrenia and Parkinson's Disease.

The theoretical import of the findings has been picked up in several areas and has contributed to discussions that have had impact beyond academia on the 'meaning of mirror neurons' and the 'myth of mirror neurons'. This is not of purely academic interest because such debates feed into the public understanding of this area of science and contribute to understanding of mental health conditions and how they may be treated. This should lead to societal impact to improve quality of life in those with such conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AFBDE1FB-4B14-40B5-8819-E12D6C1F6BA7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The objective of Theme 1 of the grant was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the acquisition of shared action representations. Here I have made significant progress, generating new knowledge about how we acquire the ability to represent others' actions in our own motor systems. For example, I have demonstrated that sensorimotor learning is required both in order to learn to imitate goal-directed actions, and in order to learn to understand others' actions. In addition, I have demonstrated that there are constraints on the speed with which the motor system can process other people's actions, and that the same constraints apply to newly learned shared action representations, showing again that sensorimotor learning is required for the acquisition of shared action representations. The work on this theme of the grant led to a significant collaborative review project with other experts in this area, culminating in a target article in the prestigious journal Behavioural and Brain Sciences.

The objective of Theme 2 of the grant was to investigate how shared action representations are controlled. Here I have again generated new knowledge, by demonstrating that the temporoparietal junction brain area is crucial for controlling imitation, and by showing that failure to control imitation can make us worse at inhibiting unwanted actions. Further work has shown that paying attention to other people's actions may not be useful for controlling imitation and that instead, attention may influence other aspects of our behaviour towards other people. This work suggests that imitation is something that we do automatically, and therefore if we want to control the extent to which people imitate others we will need to find a way to overcome these automatic processes.

This grant has allowed me to form new collaborations with researchers in the UK and overseas, including hosting a visiting researcher from Italy and collaborating with a Canadian research group. I also hosted a highly successful international conference during the grant, with 60 participants from the UK and around the world, including several other ESRC Future Research Leaders. This conference led to a successful proposal for a theme issue of the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B on the subject of 'processes for understanding self and others', which was published in January 2016. In the longer term, I anticipate that the opportunity to form links with other ESRC FRLs through this grant will lead to a variety of fruitful research collaborations during the coming years. Finally, I have begun the process of translating the outcomes of this grant into tangible applied impacts through a collaboration with a network of schools catering to children with special educational needs. I will be able to report further details of these impacts in my Narrative Impact report.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings demonstrate the importance of learning - in particular sensorimotor learning - for imitation and subsequent social interaction. I envisage that these findings will be important in at least two sectors: education and sports learning. In sports learning, it will be important to understand that learning occurs best when the learner is provided not only with visual information to copy, but also visual feedback from their own motor attempts, because if imitation is something that we acquire through learning, then we need to see the outcomes of our own attempts in order to match them to the desired outcome. In the sector of education, it will be important to take these findings forward in order to design sensorimotor learning interventions to help improve imitation. This is something that I am working on taking forward in collaboration with teachers from schools for children with special educational needs.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>15795E83-C49C-43E4-8D81-B8018128839F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://sites.google.com/site/carolinecatmur/shared-action-representations</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7C03966E-8DE2-47FC-B59A-16CCA7757FA3"><gtr:id>7C03966E-8DE2-47FC-B59A-16CCA7757FA3</gtr:id><gtr:title>Cross-modal repetition effects in the mu rhythm indicate tactile mirroring during action observation.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/739a843e906584898347ed783e4299fa"><gtr:id>739a843e906584898347ed783e4299fa</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Coll MP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0010-9452</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5DB75C1D-4899-43EE-80A5-82612BFD7421"><gtr:id>5DB75C1D-4899-43EE-80A5-82612BFD7421</gtr:id><gtr:title>Self-other control processes in social cognition: from imitation to empathy.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.
