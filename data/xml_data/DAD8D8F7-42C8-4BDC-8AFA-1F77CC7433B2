Centre</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/K000446/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The UKCCSRC is a national UK research hub for Carbon Capture and Storage with three main priorities:
Delivering Research Impact Developing Leaders Shaping Capability
Strategy - The UKCCSRC will bring strategy to UK academic CCS research in support of government targets.
Impact - will be maximised by providing a national focal point for CCS R&amp;amp;D to bring together the user community and
academics to analyse problems, devise and carry out world-leading research and share delivery. A key priority will be to
help rebuild the UK economy by driving an integrated research programme focused on maximising the contribution of CCS
to a low-carbon energy system for UK.
Research will be linked to the following pathways to impact in future stages of CCS deployment:
a) Maximise the learning from the DECC CCS demonstration programme to reduce costs and risks for subsequent CCS
projects to.
b) Develop a knowledge base for rollout of CCS as part of UK electricity sector decarbonisation in the 2020s, including for
the life of this CCS infrastructure until 2050 and beyond.
c) Prepare for extensive deployment of CCS to meet UK 2050 targets, including CCS on industry, very low residual
emissions from CCS on fossil fuels and negative emissions from biomass with CCS.
Leaders - The UKCCSRC will cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries to bring together visionary leaders able to set
research agendas that fully combine the intersecting fields of knowledge required to maximise the potential of CCS,
inspirational team leaders for complex, long-term research programmes, and will also provide leadership development
opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers.
Capability - The UK CCS Research Centre will provide CCS researchers with the space, support and opportunities to foster
creativity and to empower them to deliver the highest quality long-term research in CCS areas where there is current or
future national need.
The activities of the UKCCSRC will be overseen by a broadly-based independent Board, reporting to RCUK and other
funders. A Management Team made up of the Principal Investigator/Director and eight Co-Investigators plus a Secretariat
will be responsible for running the Centre. Nine additional Research Area Champions will also help cover the wide range of
different specialised knowledge fields involved in implementing CCS systems.
The existing UK CCS Community Network will be operated by the Centre, giving a fully inclusive forum for UK CCS
stakeholders and a route for all UK academics to engage with the UKCCSRC.
The UKCCSRC initial funding supports a core research programme (&amp;pound;3M) that covers a number of evident gaps in existing
research and also includes scoping research in areas likely to be of strategic importance. It also funds shared national
facilities (&amp;pound;2M plus &amp;pound;2.9M from DECC). A further &amp;pound;1.5M has been set aside for flexible seed funding to be allocated on a
competitive basis for emerging strategic research needs.

Academic Beneficiaries
Describe who will benefit from the research [up to 4000 chars].
The Centre will be expanded by a number of routes:
a) Academic researchers on existing and new CCS projects will be invited to link these to the Centre.
b) Non-academic partners in projects that are linked to the Centre may become UKCCSRC Affiliates
c) Additional funding for UKCCSRC research programmes will be sought from RCUK and other UK and international
government-funded sources and also from industry.
Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID)
The key overall strategy for future UKCCSRC expansion is to couple research with impact from the outset. Proposed
research will have to be linked to plausible routes to deliver a positive impact for CCS deployment. The RAPID process will
run throughout the course of the UKCCSRC with results summarised in a RAPID Handbook, updated yearly.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A broad range of beneficiaries and users for research developed by the UKCCRC can be identified. Key stakeholder groups and examples of their core interests are outline below.

UK Policymakers - UKCCSRC will be an expert group able to provide reliable evidence base to inform strategic decisions on UK energy mix and role that CCS may play in it and on wider aspects of CCS in global energy and climate change mitigation to achieve 2050 targets and beyond.

UK Regulators - Technical advice to develop and maintain fit-for-purpose regulation and guidance, including on capture-readiness and best available technology.

NGOs (Non-Governmental Organisations) - NGOs typically have very small analytical teams in-house, so availability of reliable, independent advice and expertise is particularly important.

Industry-Power utilities - Analytical techniques and up-to-date reviews of promising developments to support and extend competence as 'informed buyers' and operators of CCS power plants and reduce risk for CCS deployment.

Industry-Transport &amp;amp; storage system developers &amp;amp; operators - Ideas and research outputs for strategic issues as well as design and operation. Explicit links between T&amp;amp;S and other aspects of the CCS chain and related long-term monitoring and environmental issues. 

Industry-Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) - Identification and development of novel design and integration concepts that can inspire product adaptations and other development activities. Collaboration on pre-competitive and proprietary research projects.

SMEs (Small &amp;amp; Medium Enterprises) - Potentially similar to OEMs, but availability of initial academic research particularly important to identify focus for developments with limited budget, also test facilities to allow product demonstration and testing.

The UKCCSRC will ensure its research achieves impact through the following activities: 

a) UKCCSRC 'Research and Pathways to Impact Development' (RAPID) Handbook: UKCCSRC will actively match its research priorities against national needs, stating expectations, requirements and responsibilities through the preparation in months 1-8 of the project of the UKCCSRC Research and Pathways to Impact Development Handbook, and regularly updating this Handbook over the course of the project. 

b) Industry/academic secondments and shared facilities: UKCCSRC funding will be available, on a competitive basis, for industrial secondments for academics and researchers to work together as normal business as part of a strategic framework to deliver CCS impacts. The UKCCSRC pilot-scale test facilities, PACT and other supported strategic centres will be open for use by both academic researchers and industrial researchers.

c) Engagement and knowledge transfer: In additions to a) and b) above, make more accessible the data and knowledge about CCS research and its outcomes, for accelerated exploitation by users, through:
i) Operating the UK CCS Community Network, linking all CCS stakeholders in the UK.
ii) Engaging with industry through a programme of sponsors and associates for a directed research programme (to be launched in year 1 of the project) and through collaboration on specific research programmes in all areas.
iii) Circulating a monthly email news letter.
iv) Operating the UK CCS Data Hub (at BGS with UKCCSRC funding).
v) Sending trained students into industry during and after their research.

d) UKCCSRC project monitoring: The UKCCSRC Coordination Group and a full-time UKCCSRC Project and Facilities Manager will monitor UKCCSRC project progress and deliverables, with stage-gating for extended projects. 

e) UKCCSRC public engagement programme: Public engagement will be embedded within all UKCCRC research projects. 

f) Attracting inward R&amp;amp;D investment: UKCCSRC will actively seek to attract industrial CCS R&amp;amp;D investment in the UK, providing a closer link between multinational companies and UKCCSRC researchers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>10127951</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SINTEF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Call 1 Project C1-30 - CLIMIT research programme, Norway</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F6987E6-D876-4484-9B2B-22529C4FCE11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Glacistore bid to IODP:

PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D in order to accelerate the development and commercialisation of novel technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. PACT facilities bridge the gap between bench-scale R&amp;amp;D and large-scale industrial pilot trials, enabling users to develop and demonstrate their technologies to provide the necessary commercial confidence before committing to the significant costs of large-scale trails. PACT offers a cost-effective and comprehensive research capability by consolidating state-of-the-art facilities and providing shared access to industry and academia.

PACT Core facilities located in Beighton near Sheffield facility incorporates two 300kW gas turbines and a 250kW pulverised fuel (coal/biomass /co-firing) air/oxy rig, both systems integrated with a (1) 1 tonne/day amine capture plant for post combustion capture (PCC) research and (2) a synthetic gas mixing facility, enabling modulation of real or generation of synthetic flue/process gasses for oxyfuel and PCC for power generation and industrial applications; pilot scale facilities are supported by comprehensive state of the art online and laboratory analytical capability.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Edinburgh Comprise ACCTROM - a mobile laboratory for long term, on site testing and evaluation of capture media for PCC applications.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Cranfield Comprise Dense Phase CO2 Transport Facility for exploring the impact of contaminants on pipeline materials behaviour; 750kWth Burner Rig - large frame gas turbines with downstream high temperature deposition and materials testing; UK's largest 75kWth Chemical Looping Rig; 150kWth PF Combustion Rig and a 250kWth CFB Combustor/Gasifier.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Nottingham Through recent expansion new state of the art analytical facilities at Nottingham have also been made available to wider users through the PACT.

Industrial and other stakeholder involvement in research
The UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities have recently completed/are currently involved in 18 research projects including industry-academia collaborative projects funded by industry, DECC and the EPSRC, and academic projects funded through NERC and EPSRC-UKCCSRC research programme. The projects involve 30 universities and 40 industrial and other organisations. The total project value exceeds &amp;pound;32m with
nearly &amp;pound;2m income to PACT over 5 years. 67% of PACT's project income is from collaborative projects with industry.

PACT is also involved in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Bioenergy and in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy providing hands on training on the facilities for a total of up to 20 students a year; the total value of the centres is &amp;pound;7.8m with 5 academic and 70 other partner organisations.

Utilisation
The PACT core facilities have had nearly 170% utilisation to date and over 300% utilisation last year. To date around 692 days have been allocated to the above committed/completed projects to end of financial year 2016/17 with 360 days already utilised. This represents 150%
utilisation with the level expected to rise with further projects over the next years.

Visits, events and presentations
Over 1000 visitors from 250 organisations (65+ academic and 200+ industrial and other organisations) have visited the UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities since autumn 2012. These include UK and international industry and government (China, Australia, Europe, US,), other CCS projects (CATO2, White Rose,), IEA GHG Summer School and UKCCSRC, BIS and APGTF meetings. This is further complemented by presentations
at CCS targeted external meetings, conferences and workshops (total target audience; ~ 1000 delegates) including a recent UK-China high level meeting organised by the UK government, and a recent international workshop at ESI Exeter with a high profile Indian delegation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>PACT facilites are located in Beighton (Sheffield/Leeds), Cranfield, Edinburgh and Nottingham.

Cost reduction for CCS technology</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The International Test Centre Network was initiated by TCM in 2012 to enable carbon capture test facilities around the world to progress the technologies that will be a key component of our clean energy future. The network aims to share knowledge that can accelerate technology commercialisation, including, for example, next-generation technologies that can sharply reduce the costs of electricity generation (and industrial products) using CO2 capture.
Since its launch, some of the world's leading CCS test centres have been sharing knowledge of construction and operation of large test facilities in order to establish a level playing field for technology vendors to reduce costs, as well as the technical, environmental and financial risks currently associated with CCS.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>UK CCS Research Centre's PACT Facilities joins CCS Test Centre Network chaired by TCM to expand international knowledge sharing capabilities and accelerate commercialisation of crucial CCS technologies. The addition of the PACT Facilities to the Network - which currently spans Norway, Canada, the United States and Italy - will extend its reach and bring UK research in carbon capture onto the international stage. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D, by providing open-access testing facilities. This helps accelerate the development and commercialisation of technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. The PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bergen</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Call 1 Project C1-30 - CLIMIT research programme, Norway</gtr:description><gtr:id>31272657-46BB-48A0-B8DB-6A786841D6AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Glacistore bid to IODP:

PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D in order to accelerate the development and commercialisation of novel technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. PACT facilities bridge the gap between bench-scale R&amp;amp;D and large-scale industrial pilot trials, enabling users to develop and demonstrate their technologies to provide the necessary commercial confidence before committing to the significant costs of large-scale trails. PACT offers a cost-effective and comprehensive research capability by consolidating state-of-the-art facilities and providing shared access to industry and academia.

PACT Core facilities located in Beighton near Sheffield facility incorporates two 300kW gas turbines and a 250kW pulverised fuel (coal/biomass /co-firing) air/oxy rig, both systems integrated with a (1) 1 tonne/day amine capture plant for post combustion capture (PCC) research and (2) a synthetic gas mixing facility, enabling modulation of real or generation of synthetic flue/process gasses for oxyfuel and PCC for power generation and industrial applications; pilot scale facilities are supported by comprehensive state of the art online and laboratory analytical capability.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Edinburgh Comprise ACCTROM - a mobile laboratory for long term, on site testing and evaluation of capture media for PCC applications.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Cranfield Comprise Dense Phase CO2 Transport Facility for exploring the impact of contaminants on pipeline materials behaviour; 750kWth Burner Rig - large frame gas turbines with downstream high temperature deposition and materials testing; UK's largest 75kWth Chemical Looping Rig; 150kWth PF Combustion Rig and a 250kWth CFB Combustor/Gasifier.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Nottingham Through recent expansion new state of the art analytical facilities at Nottingham have also been made available to wider users through the PACT.

Industrial and other stakeholder involvement in research
The UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities have recently completed/are currently involved in 18 research projects including industry-academia collaborative projects funded by industry, DECC and the EPSRC, and academic projects funded through NERC and EPSRC-UKCCSRC research programme. The projects involve 30 universities and 40 industrial and other organisations. The total project value exceeds &amp;pound;32m with
nearly &amp;pound;2m income to PACT over 5 years. 67% of PACT's project income is from collaborative projects with industry.

PACT is also involved in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Bioenergy and in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy providing hands on training on the facilities for a total of up to 20 students a year; the total value of the centres is &amp;pound;7.8m with 5 academic and 70 other partner organisations.

Utilisation
The PACT core facilities have had nearly 170% utilisation to date and over 300% utilisation last year. To date around 692 days have been allocated to the above committed/completed projects to end of financial year 2016/17 with 360 days already utilised. This represents 150%
utilisation with the level expected to rise with further projects over the next years.

Visits, events and presentations
Over 1000 visitors from 250 organisations (65+ academic and 200+ industrial and other organisations) have visited the UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities since autumn 2012. These include UK and international industry and government (China, Australia, Europe, US,), other CCS projects (CATO2, White Rose,), IEA GHG Summer School and UKCCSRC, BIS and APGTF meetings. This is further complemented by presentations
at CCS targeted external meetings, conferences and workshops (total target audience; ~ 1000 delegates) including a recent UK-China high level meeting organised by the UK government, and a recent international workshop at ESI Exeter with a high profile Indian delegation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>PACT facilites are located in Beighton (Sheffield/Leeds), Cranfield, Edinburgh and Nottingham.

New collaborations included project proposals with SINTEF and NTNU, applications to the UKCCSRC International Research Collaboration Fund and UKCCSRC Call for PACT Running Days (one successful application in each), and agreement from a Norwegian researcher to sit on the expert advisory panel for a UK (EPSRC) project; existing collaboration with Telemark University College was also strengthened with the time and focus allowed by the meeting.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Research Council of Norway provided the venue for the meeting.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The UKCCSRC partnered with the Research Council of Norway to run this two day workshop on Wednesday 18 and Thursday 19 March 2015, which also hosted Canadian researchers. The objective for the meeting was to link ongoing capture research projects and to foster collaboration. The meeting focused primarily on technology options, deployment status and Research and Development issues for CO2 capture from industry sources and natural gas power plants respectively. These are areas in which Norway, Canada and the UK share common interests, and ways of taking these forward in collaboration were explored.

The meeting consisted of presentations and discussion sessions covering CCS strategies and implementations in the UK, Canada and Norway, pilots and demonstration projects, and CO2 capture research. The programme of the meeting, including publicly available outputs, can be seen at https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/events/uk-norway-canada-co2-capture-meeting. To enable focussed discussions on different capture topics, small discussion sessions were organised. These enabled researchers to find out about others' research areas and where there could be potential collaboration opportunities. The meeting also allowed plenty of time for informal networking, which allowed researchers to form new relationships and build on existing relationships in an informal setting. 

The UKCCSRC coordinated the attendance of UK researchers. Invitations were issued to either the PI or a Co-I of all ongoing capture projects in the UK funded by the EPSRC - 20/24 of these projects were represented at the meeting.

Follow-up engagement targeted to specific research areas was facilitated by webinar, organised by the UKCCSRC.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Geological Survey of Iran (GSI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Iran, Islamic Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Early Career Researcher International Exchange Fund award - Lisa Roach - Geological Survey of Canada, Natural Resources Canada</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA361E99-6E6F-44F7-BE3D-603B2A40D6FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper accepted for publication in Geophysics.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The work partner's contribution was access to all the seismic data and expertise in standard seismic processing.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>My contribution in the collaboration was expertise and the production of work products.

Cost reduction for CCS technology</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The International Test Centre Network was initiated by TCM in 2012 to enable carbon capture test facilities around the world to progress the technologies that will be a key component of our clean energy future. The network aims to share knowledge that can accelerate technology commercialisation, including, for example, next-generation technologies that can sharply reduce the costs of electricity generation (and industrial products) using CO2 capture.
Since its launch, some of the world's leading CCS test centres have been sharing knowledge of construction and operation of large test facilities in order to establish a level playing field for technology vendors to reduce costs, as well as the technical, environmental and financial risks currently associated with CCS.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>UK CCS Research Centre's PACT Facilities joins CCS Test Centre Network chaired by TCM to expand international knowledge sharing capabilities and accelerate commercialisation of crucial CCS technologies. The addition of the PACT Facilities to the Network - which currently spans Norway, Canada, the United States and Italy - will extend its reach and bring UK research in carbon capture onto the international stage. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D, by providing open-access testing facilities. This helps accelerate the development and commercialisation of technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation.

Cost reduction for CCS technology</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The International Test Centre Network was initiated by TCM in 2012 to enable carbon capture test facilities around the world to progress the technologies that will be a key component of our clean energy future. The network aims to share knowledge that can accelerate technology commercialisation, including, for example, next-generation technologies that can sharply reduce the costs of electricity generation (and industrial products) using CO2 capture.
Since its launch, some of the world's leading CCS test centres have been sharing knowledge of construction and operation of large test facilities in order to establish a level playing field for technology vendors to reduce costs, as well as the technical, environmental and financial risks currently associated with CCS.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>UK CCS Research Centre's PACT Facilities joins CCS Test Centre Network chaired by TCM to expand international knowledge sharing capabilities and accelerate commercialisation of crucial CCS technologies. The addition of the PACT Facilities to the Network - which currently spans Norway, Canada, the United States and Italy - will extend its reach and bring UK research in carbon capture onto the international stage. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D, by providing open-access testing facilities. This helps accelerate the development and commercialisation of technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. The PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Sheffield</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UKCCSRC - PACT National Core Facilities</gtr:description><gtr:id>3084E2BB-3C7D-4169-A5F6-EFFCB7C35BAF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UKCCSRC Pilot-scale Advanced Capture Technology (PACT) facilities are national specialist R&amp;amp;D facilities for combustion and carbon capture technology research, encompassing advanced fossil-fuel energy, bioenergy and carbon capture and storage/utilisation technologies for power generation and industrial applications.

PACT facilities bring together a comprehensive range of integrated pilot-scale and accompanying specialist research and analytical facilities, supported by leading academic expertise. The purpose of PACT is to support and catalyse industrial and academic R&amp;amp;D in order to accelerate the development and commercialisation of novel technologies for carbon capture and clean power generation. PACT facilities bridge the gap between bench-scale R&amp;amp;D and large-scale industrial pilot trials, enabling users to develop and demonstrate their technologies to provide the necessary commercial confidence before committing to the significant costs of large-scale trails. PACT offers a cost-effective and comprehensive research capability by consolidating state-of-the-art facilities and providing shared access to industry and academia.

PACT Core facilities located in Beighton near Sheffield facility incorporates two 300kW gas turbines and a 250kW pulverised fuel (coal/biomass /co-firing) air/oxy rig, both systems integrated with a (1) 1 tonne/day amine capture plant for post combustion capture (PCC) research and (2) a synthetic gas mixing facility, enabling modulation of real or generation of synthetic flue/process gasses for oxyfuel and PCC for power generation and industrial applications; pilot scale facilities are supported by comprehensive state of the art online and laboratory analytical capability.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Cranfield Comprise Dense Phase CO2 Transport Facility for exploring the impact of contaminants on pipeline materials behaviour; 750kWth Burner Rig - large frame gas turbines with downstream high temperature deposition and materials testing; UK's largest 75kWth Chemical Looping Rig; 150kWth PF Combustion Rig and a 250kWth CFB Combustor/Gasifier.

PACT Satellite Facilities in Nottingham Through recent expansion new state of the art analytical facilities at Nottingham have also been made available to wider users through the PACT.

Industrial and other stakeholder involvement in research
The UKCCSRC PACT Core facilities have recently completed/are currently involved in 18 research projects including industry-academia collaborative projects funded by industry, DECC and the EPSRC, and academic projects funded through NERC and EPSRC-UKCCSRC research programme. The projects involve 30 universities and 40 industrial and other organisations. The total project value exceeds &amp;pound;32m with
nearly &amp;pound;2m income to PACT over 5 years. 67% of PACT's project income is from collaborative projects with industry.

PACT is also involved in the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Bioenergy and in Carbon Capture and Storage and Cleaner Fossil Energy providing hands on training on the facilities for a total of up to 20 students a year; the total value of the centres is &amp;pound;7.8m with 5 academic and 70 other partner organisations.

Utilisation
The PACT core facilities have had nearly 170% utilisation to date and over 300% utilisation last year. To date around 692 days have been allocated to the above committed/completed projects to end of financial year 2016/17 with 360 days already utilised. This represents 150%
utilisation with the level expected to rise with further projects over the next years.

Both projects in the UK Government's CCS Commercialisation Competition participated, and the event combined a panel discussion with interactive demonstrations. Co-organisers were Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage, British Geological Survey, Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge.

Four UKCCSRC Research Area Champions [Co-Is on the grant] participated, and were supported by five UKCCSRC Early Career Researchers and two members of the UKCCSRC Secretariat.

Activity resulted in a fair amount of media activity, particularly on the survey of people's perceptions of CCS vs. fracking.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/blog/reporting-carbon-conundrum-british-science-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Call 1 Project C1-40 - FleCCSnet workshops</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D8B7524-572E-474E-9576-0F6517860F9E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To ensure industrial relevance and rapid and effective dissemination to relevant stakeholders, two workshops were held during the duration of the project. The workshops not only influenced the direction of the research, but also engaged with industry stakeholders so that they could take ownership of the results of the project and incorporate the results into company practices for modelling of CCS systems. 

The purpose of the first FleCCSnet workshop was to identify and confirm the key questions to be considered in order to understand the most likely impacts of variability in the CO2 sources and variability in CO2 sinks on CO2 transport system design and operation. There were a total of 21 attendees including 7 representatives from PSE, Scottish Power, BP, SCCS, Parsons Brinckerhoff, Element Energy, and AMEC. 

Workshop outputs:
- Critical variables were identified.
- Scenarios were split into short, medium and long term (Periods 1, 2 and 3) and the type of store to be used -A, B and C.
- The findings of Workshop 1 are summarised in two documents available on the UKCCSRC website.
- Base load power plant data and a shifting pattern for a 24 hour were provided by Scottish Power for use with the project.

Workshop 2 focused on transient issues in the pipeline and storage site. The scenario output from Workshop 2 was reviewed, preliminary results of the pipeline and storage transient models were reviewed and input was provided into the development of further analysis. There were 23 attendees (15 of whom were new engagements) to the workshop including 10 representatives from National Grid, AMEC Foster Wheeler, PSE, Costain, Element Energy, Energy Institute, Five-Quarter Energy Holdings and UKCCSRC.

Key Findings:
- Scenarios with EOR should currently be neglected within the project.
- Short term scenarios should be investigated in terms of pipeline line packing time to investigate issues that could result from smaller emitters entering the network in Period 3. 
- The project's storage model could be used as a screening of storage fields based upon the pipeline's ability to be able to take up storage limitations.
- Guidelines should be made available on the best practise for entry into a CO2 pipeline network.

As part of the workshop, the following support for the project was received from the attendees:
- Information on well head conditions were provided by National Grid for use by the project.
- Cost data for use by the project provided by Costain.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/resources/ccs-projects-directory/flexible-ccs-network-development-fleccsnet</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Call 1 Project C1-39 - ACS National Meetings, USA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>84F87806-5CB0-4ABD-B61D-418D7A4549C5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentations were given at American Chemistry Society Meetings in 2014 and 2015:

On 13 November Jon Gibbins presented on CCS for natural gas power plants at the MIT Carbon Sequestration Forum 16 in Cambridge, MA. The other speaker on the topic was Satish Reddy from Fluor whose talk included Fluor's extensive experience on the (now closed) nearby Bellingham power plant. Other topics were 'Technology Innovation and CCS' (Michael Matuszewski, NETL and Richard Lester, MIT), 'Induced Seismicity' (Steve Hickman, USGS and Ruben Juanes, MIT), 'Direct Air Capture' (David Keith, Carbon Engineering &amp;amp; Harvard University), 'CO2 Capture Project' (Nigel Jenvey, BP), 'Oxy-Combustion' (M&amp;oacute;nica Lupi&amp;oacute;n, MIT and Bob Schrecengost, Alstom Power) and a discussion on 'Moving CCS Forward' (Richard Esposito, Southern Company, Tim Wiwchar, Shell and John Thompson, Clean Air Task Force). - See more at: https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/jon-gibbins-presents-ccs-natural-gas-power-plants-mit-carbon-sequestration-forum-16#sthash.32Npp6pg.dpuf</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/news-events/news/jon-gibbins-presents-ccs-natural-gas-power-plants-mit-carbon-sequestration-forum-16</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Climate Change Committee visit to UKCCSRC-PACT</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>03FBF8E3-5D43-4C10-B5D9-3F955B5D60E6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As part of its inquiry into Carbon Capture and Storage, the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee visited the UKCCSRC's PACT facilities in Sheffield on Thursday 23 January 2014.
Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said, &amp;quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. The facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies. I am sure that our experience here will help to feed into our wider work on CCS.&amp;quot;
During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UKCCSRC Glacistore - UK IODP Conference 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB4D0ABA-2EE9-4EFA-9CC7-AAF7C6031050</gtr:id><gtr:impact>STEWART, H A, and THE GLACISTORE IODP PROPOSAL #852 PROPONENTS. 2015.

It develops, coordinates and leads a programme of underpinning research that covers all aspects of CCS to deliver basic knowledge and understanding and support UK government efforts on energy and climate change.

The UKCCSRC provides a national focal point for CCS R and D to analyse problems, devise and carry out world-leading research and share delivery. We help build the UK economy by driving an integrated research and impact delivery programme focused on maximising the contribution of CCS to a low- carbon energy system for the UK. The build-up of CCS in the UK needs to be supported by close links, in both directions, between underpinning research teams in all areas and the CCS practitioners undertaking demonstration and deployment. The UKCCSRC has a key role here through its Research and Pathways to Impact Development (RAPID) process and its Research Group activities linked to partner organisations in the UK and overseas and a wide range of stakeholders. 

The UKCCSRC provides CCS researchers with the infrastructure, support and opportunities to foster creativity and to deliver the highest quality long-term research on CCS in areas where there is current or future national need. Our multidisciplinary research enhances national capacity and act as focal point for international engagement. 

The need for a UK CCS-based decarbonisation option remains strong, as evidenced by both the Committee on Climate Change and the Energy Technologies Institute. Withdrawal of capital funding for the Commercialisation Competition has however made UK Government strategy less clear, and the need for the UKCCSRC to co-ordinate development work with domestic, European, and global stakeholders, is now of even more import. The UKCCSRC, through its role in the EERA CCS Joint Implementation Programme, is well-placed to help shape the European research and policy agenda to support these developments. Links are also in place with other leading CCS countries to allow project experience and research efforts to be shared and coordinated.

The UKCCSRC brings together visionary leaders who will set national and international multi- discipline and medium-timescale research agendas that combine the range of intersecting fields of knowledge that are required to maximise the potential of CCS. The UKCCSRC provides new leadership opportunities with the delivery of complex, long-term research programmes, and provide leadership and development opportunities for early- and mid-career researchers. As the project reaches its final year both Call 1 and Call 2 projects, funded through the Centre's flexible research programme, have and are delivering a wide range of impactful outputs (see later in the submission).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A7F9CCE1-3610-4198-B4E1-D08E444A97BA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The UKCCSRC is established nationally and internationally as the focal point for UK academic research on CCS. Membership currently stands at 294 experienced academics from nearly 50 UK universities and research institutes, plus another 253 Early Career Researchers.

In summary, and against its strategic goals, the Centre has:

Delivering impact
- Funded 27 research projects (&amp;pound;4.9m - 5x oversubscribed), which have also leveraged &amp;pound;2.5m of co-funding
- Continued to grow the UK CCS network programme following a successful transition from the previous scheme
- Established RAPID (see below) as an accepted methodology for identifying and delivering prioritised research
- Achieved international recognition as a centre of excellence for CCS research as evidenced by the six MOUs already in place with major overseas CCS hubs

Shaping Capability
- Established PACT (see below) as the national CCS experimental facility(s) and which is already extensively utilised by both academic and industrial research teams
- Through its Research Group structure the Centre also established co-ordination processes for all UK academic research, a total of over 200 research projects and &amp;pound;100m funding
- Established a continuous programme of targeted communications and technical events for researchers

Developing Leaders
- The Early Career Researcher programme has been established within which ECRs have been enabled to become PIs for smaller projects, are mentored by senior academics who are members of the UKCCSRC Coordination Group, and also have access to both ECR-focussed events and wider UKCCSRC activities
- The Centre's Independent Advisory Panel (industry leaders and other stakeholders from across the globe) is utilised to provide the CCS academic community with experience and advice relating to both the industrial and policy context within which they need to be able to operate if they are to be successful on a national/international basis
- The Centre's series of technical workshops provide potential leaders in the field the opportunity to discuss both (inter)national multi-discipline and medium-timescale research agendas and the opportunity to understand how to deliver complex, long-term research programmes

The UKCCSRC provides a Research Group structure with targeted communications and technical events for its researchers and UKCCSRC has set up the first national open-access CO2 capture test facilities in UK. It also is coordinating all UK CCS academic research, a total of over 200 projects and &amp;pound;100M funding, through its member-defined Research Themes structured landscape, which builds up groups of researchers with common interests and makes them and their work readily accessible to users. The Centre has close links to UK CCS industry and other stakeholders through its 20-strong Independent Advisory Panel and its Associate membership programme (117 members) and wider Network (506 members). International recognition is evidenced by the six MOUs already in place with other major overseas CCS hubs and centres and more being developed. The UKCCSRC has already operated a successful international researcher exchange programme and has collaborative research projects taking advantage of unique overseas facilities. The UKCCSRC issued its first open research call within 4 months of starting and its second after 22 months. Together these have funded 27 research projects totalling &amp;pound;4.9M (from about five times that number of applications) with &amp;pound;2.5M co-funding. The UKCCSRC's portfolio brings both top CCS experts and &amp;quot;new to the field&amp;quot; researchers together to work on tackling key challenges in the UK's CCS research roadmap. Through the Research Themes the UKCCSRC also links these internal projects to the wider UK CCS research portfolio, looking for synergies to add value and providing an active user engagement programme through information management, targeted communications and a range of specialist meetings. The Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID) methodology has been developed and implemented by the Centre with support from its Independent Advisory Panel members and wider industry through the CCSA Association Technical Working Group. This sees academics and CCS practitioners working closely together to help identify, plan, execute and implement relevant, high-impact research. A strong Early Career Researcher programme, linked to the new CCS CDT based at Nottingham, provides focussed events and also supports ECR participation in wider UKCCSRC and other research activities. Many young researchers have been able to take advantage of the Call 1 and 2 projects to become PI on a smaller project to pump-prime their independent research careers; all projects are mentored by experienced researchers from the UKCCSRC Coordination Group. The UKCCSRC Research Area Champion team brings together the senior academics currently leading UK CCS research with two generations of future leaders, to pass on experience and build continuity as they develop greater collective UK expertise in their specialities. With co-funding from DECC, the UKCCSRC PACT initiative has, for the first time in UK, established national facilities available to all academics, with the main site at Sheffield and satellite installations at Cranfield, Edinburgh and Nottingham. These have acted as a platform to initiate and develop strategic academic and industrial partnerships, working with research institutions, industry, funding agencies, UK governments and other sponsors and benefactors to help secure significant funding for CCS research in coal and gas power generation. To date the PACT facilities have been used as a catalyst to secure more than 8 EPSRC/DECC/industry research grants that could not have happened without them. Demand for time on the equipment has been well beyond expectations and units are heavily booked for the next two years. The UKCCSRC provides all UK CCS researchers with access to world-class national centre capabilities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Outputs from the centre are already, and will continue to be, utilised across both the research and policy spaces as the UK moves to meet its decarbonisation targets. Use of the Centre's specific outputs (detailed in other sections), occurs in three ways:

1. Specific research findings influence and underpin future technical development programmes within both the academic community and industry.
2. The RAPID methodology can be utilised by research teams and research funders to prioritise future programmes of work.
3. Understanding developed within UKCCSRC, and communicated to DECC, Committee on Climate Change, the All Parliamentary Party Group on CCS, amongst others, influences the shape of UK CCS policy developments.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F0D99645-3EEF-4C12-B121-C98ACEF63A87</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://ukccsrc.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UKCCSRC - Industrial Decarbonisation Roadmaps</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>89D7C1B9-5A90-4031-9A21-E8968502E25B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2014 a joint project was launched by DECC, BIS, and eight energy intensive UK industrial sectors to investigate and develop pathways towards their deep decarbonisation by 2050 that would also ensure continued commercial viability.

These activities have had a broad range of outcomes including improved knowledge and understanding of the breadth, depth and quality of UK academic work on CCS among UK policy-makers. This activity also ensured that emerging findings from the academic community were available in a timely way to policy-makers.

The Centre regularly receives requests to provide consultation responses or to contribute to document/strategy preparation by stakeholders. The Centre's Coordination Group decides how such requests will be handled: the Centre either passes such requests to Centre members to respond in a personal capacity, or asks Centre members to provide comment to the Centre so that it can submit a corporate response. In the latter case members are asked to confirm in writing that they agree with the content of the Centre's response before it is formally submitted. The UKCCSRC and its members have contributed to the development of all UK national research roadmaps for CCS, by responding to consultations and as members of working groups etc.

Over a third of these projects are being or have been executed in collaboration with industry, or provide underpinning research closely related to opportunities that are being given the highest priority by industry.

Key Outputs
These projects have and are delivering a range of output types for industry,
although some are also relevant to other stakeholders groups:
&amp;gt; Comprehensive system analysis packages [1, 2]
&amp;gt; Improved CO2 capture technologies [3, 4]
&amp;gt; Experimentally verified computational models [5, 6]
&amp;gt; Advanced measurement and monitoring technologies [7, 8]
&amp;gt; Fundamental knowledge development (bio-CCS &amp;amp; CO2 storage) [9, 10]

Impact for Industrial Stakeholders
As the (UK) energy system continues to decarbonise the ability for whole chain CCS systems to operate flexibly will be commercially significant.
Two projects have investigated amine-based PCC and CO2 pipeline networks in this respect, producing both models and design and operating
guidelines that can be used by designers [1, 2].

The ability to cost-effectively deploy CCS to decarbonise industries such as cement and steel, as well as the production of hydrogen, is also a priority.
UKCCSRC funded projects have demonstrated the viability of enhanced calcium looping, and the potential for novel materials to reduce both the
energy and materials demand for the conversion of natural gases into high purity H2, CO2 and N2 [3, 4].

Oxy-fuel combustion remains an area of intense technological development for furnace and turbine suppliers alike, as it can significantly affect heat
transfer and many other properties. Plant designers therefore require new (experimentally verified) computational models that take these into
account, and projects within the UKCCSRC programme have been developing these for coal, gas and biomass technologies [5, 6].

The EU ETS demands CO2 (mass) metering accuracy to 1.5% and, as CO2 prices rise, industry will require the measurement and monitoring of CO2
flows across the chain to this accuracy or better. Two projects within the programme have created a dedicated flow test facility for meter evaluation
under CCS conditions, investigated the increased uncertainty when impurities are present, and defined a technical specification for Coriolis
flow meters [7, 8].

In order to meet future targets for maximum atmospheric CO2 levels bioenergy with CCS, which is a net negative emissions technology, will
need to be deployed at a global scale. The Bio-CAP-UK project is therefore developing the fundamental knowledge required to achieve operational
excellence for flexible, efficient and sustainable bio-CCS power plants [9].

Similarly, the availability of sufficient high quality CO2 storage is critical and another UKCCSRC funded project has laid the groundwork for a drilling
programme to help prove storage opportunities in the North Sea Basin [10].

The Energy and Climate Change Select Committee also made a fact-finding visit to the UKCCSRC PACT facilities while in Sheffield. During their visit to PACT, the Committee participated in an introductory discussion on the equipment at PACT and its applications and then made a detailed tour of the site. 

Tim Yeo MP, Chair of the Committee, said of the day &amp;quot;Carbon capture and storage could be a key technology helping us to decarbonise our power sector and heavy industry. There is currently a disappointing lack of progress on developing CCS. The PACT facilities are an excellent example of the types of R&amp;amp;D projects the UK should be investing in to ensure we have a home grown low-carbon industry here in the UK. I look forward to seeing firsthand how the facilities are bridging the gap between bench-scale R&amp;amp;D and industrial pilot scale projects accelerating the development of novel carbon capture technologies.

Coriolis flowmeters are an options to measure CO2 accurately in transport pipelines. However, the presence of impurities can affect the performance of the flowmeter. Therefore, the performance of a Coriolis flowmeter was evaluated using CO2 fluid with impurities in a mass flow-rig designed based on the gravimetric calibration in start / stop operations. In each test, the mass recorded by the Coriolis flowmeter was compared to the mass collected in the receiving facilities and measured using high accurate balance in order to obtain the relative deviation of the test. During the tests, in addition to the mass and volume flow rate, the operational pressure and temperature as well as velocity and density were recorded. The series of tests were conducted using different fluids, including: pure N2 (validation tests), pure CO2 (reference tests), pre-combustion mixture, post-combustion mixture, Oxyfuel-I mixture and Oxyfuel-II mixture. 
The recorded data as well as recorded and measured masses are available in the provided excel files for each investigated fluid.
The excel datasheets were recorded directly during the tests with each fluid. The recorded data were including temperature, pressure, density, velocity, mass and volumetric flow rates.

We have developed an automated algorithm, based on the LTA/STA detection method, that scans all available records from all deployed seismometers, and detects any &amp;quot;anomalies&amp;quot; in the signal that might represent a nanoseismic event. The methodology includes further, partially automated, steps where the detected anomalies go through filtering and only those nanoseismic signals that satisfy a series of criteria are accepted.

The Research and Pathways to Impact Delivery (RAPID) process was carried out to identify areas of research that will form the Centre's core projects. Potential research impacts were considered with reference to the RCUK Pathways to Impact. The Research Councils have grouped impacts into two strands, academic and economic and societal, and these strands provided a general guide for UKCCSRC work on CCS research impact.

The RAPID Process
The RAPID process began with Phase 1, which captured research impacts through UKCCSRC engagement with a wide range of CCS stakeholders. The UKCCSC Biannual Meeting, on 2-3 April 2012, in London fully launched this engagement strategy. This and subsequent meetings, led by the UKCCSRC Research Area Champions, provided well-considered content for Application Impact Tables, which link research areas to levels of knowledge in these areas and to impacts. The research areas and impacts were mapped against the APGTF Report Research and Development priorities (the report is key to the DECC Roadmap for CCS). The results of this community scoping exercise have been compiled and made sense of through production of the first version of the RAPID Handbook, which was launched on 24th July 2012. The RAPID handbook serves to provide the Centre with research requirements for core research activities to be undertaken. 

Revising/Updating RAPID
A series of meetings were held in November 2013 to discuss further RAPID phases, inviting Centre Members to participate in a series of RAPID meetings to review and update the RAPID handbook in light of the forthcoming update to the APGTF Roadmap for CCS. These inputs were included in the RAPID 1.1 Handbook.

Following two stages of development for RAPID with predominantly academic inputs, links have been established with the Centre's Independent Advisory Panel (IAP) and the Carbon Capture and Storage Association (CCSA) Technical Working Group for more targeted CCS practitioner engagement to set priorities and routes for impact.

Real progress in understanding actual CCS deployment issues and the underpinning research required to address them can, however, only be made with the cooperation of the limited number of stakeholders with actual experience of planning and, as time goes on, also executing projects. Progress is therefore related to the rate of CCS market development and the field has seen a significant number of companies leaving since the UKCCSRC project started as well as others joining.

Topical updates, based on links with practitioners, will therefore be undertaken as opportunities allow.

RAPID Phase 2
Just before the UKCCSRC Cranfield Biannual meeting in April 2015 industry representatives from three of the leading post-combustion CCS projects, Peterhead (SSE/Shell), Boundary Dam 3 (SaskPower) and Maasvlakte (EON), met with the IAP and IEAGHG Programme Chair, John Gale, and UKCCSRC academic experts for what is to believed to be a world-first structured workshop on how research activities directed at Phase 2/3 projects for post-combustion capture using amines might be prioritised (i.e. on cost reductions and other criteria). This was intentionally a very well-defined application and one for which the necessary practitioner experience is available. It is also expected (based on subsequently-published ETI analysis) to be a capture application that would be a part of any significant future CCS roll-out to help achieve UK electricity sector decarbonisation by around 2030. Full information on the two-day workshop can be seen at https://ukccsrc.ac.uk/rapid-phase-2.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6CC12BE-9CEB-41F3-80A8-0E7E0A9E1190</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The RAPID process is on-going and Application Impact Tables will be further refined through specialist meetings led by Research Area Champions, to provide greater granularity.

Ultimately, the tool will make it straightforward for users to continually and rapidly update their EoS in response to emerging experimental data. The resulting EoS will deliver greater range, certainty and computational efficiency in a wide range of CCS modelling. These EoS will contribute to more effective optimisation of CCS, making the process cleaner, safer, more efficient and more economical. This modelling will also be essential to design codes and safety regulations and will provide key modelling support to the urgently required public engagement and consultation on pipeline transport of CO2.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>UKCCSRC Call 1 Project C1-22 -
