from the Arab Spring to Occupy Wall Street to the Spanish Indignados, it is clear that new media technologies have the potential to create social change, reforming political systems, and challenging a range of oppressive ideologies. Yet such technologies have also opened up highly visible public spaces for the proliferation of online forms of sexism, harassment, and misogyny (hatred of women and girls). There have been numerous high profile stories about 'e-bile' (online hatred) and 'trolling' (online stalking) of women, and a growing concern over the normalisation and acceptance of rape jokes and images that celebrate violence against girls and women on web 2.0 platforms like Twitter and Facebook. While the UK government has recognised 'media sexism' as a growing problem, and has run a number of awareness campaigns aimed at rape prevention and stopping sexual violence and abuse, there is little research which documents the particular forms that misogyny takes in a digitally mediated culture, and even less which analyses the range of activist responses to this problem which mobilize new media technologies in innovative and creative ways.
 Although it is only beginning to attract mainstream media attention, feminists are fighting back against the proliferation of rape culture through their uses of new media platforms and technologies. For example, an international group of feminist activists recently initiated the #FBrape campaign which solicited over 60,000 tweets and 5,000 emails to Facebook's corporate advertisers, demanding that companies pull their advertisements from the social media company due to Facebook's refusal to remove misogynist content encouraging violence against women and girls. The one-week campaign resulted in a promise from Facebook to change their policies on hate speech and make it easier to remove pages which promote rape culture, misogyny and sexual violence towards women and girls. Similarly, a number of websites, Facebook pages and Twitter hashtags have been created which encourage women and girls to document, photograph, and record instances of misogyny and harassment, raising public awareness and creating communities to support victims. Consequently, the main objectives of this research are to 1) map out how and when rape culture, harassment, misogyny and sexual violence are occurring in on and off-line spaces; 2) explore and analyse feminist responses to these incidents; 3) understand the experiences of women and girls who participate in this activism; and 4) to document feminist responses and experiences through the creation of a living archive of contemporary digital feminist activism.
 To meet these aims the project uses interdisciplinary research methods including content and feminist critical discourse analysis of online media, and ethnographic methods, such as observation of online activist communities and interviews with feminist activists, to explore how and why they are using digital technology. The research has the potential to benefit a number of stakeholders including feminist activists, government, charitable organisations, and media companies like Facebook by documenting some of the forms that new media misogyny is taking and a range of feminist digital activist responses. Our primary digital output is an online archive that will document this feminist activism and facilitate a collaborative space where activists can record their own initiatives and connect with other women and girls globally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project's findings and assessment of its significance will be disseminated through a series of outputs for academics (two books, one of which is an edited collection) and the public (an online archive documenting feminist activism and experiences).
 In order to engage with key potential users of our research findings and our digital archive we will hold an interim data sharing workshop at the IOE, to which we will invite activists, policy makers, industry members and charitable organisations to offer feedback on our emerging findings, and to help shape the digital archive. We will also host a one-day symposium 'Online Feminist Activism' at the Feminist Library, which will further disseminate our results amongst academics, feminists, charities, policy makers, students, and other community members.
 The research will:
1. Document, collect and publicise various forms of feminist activism which challenge sexism, misogyny and rape culture.
2. Involve feminist activists, policy makers, industry leaders, and charitable organisations in the research, particularly at the stages of data analysis and dissemination. 
 Who Will Benefit:
1. Academics will obtain a greater understanding of the ways misogyny and rape culture circulate in on and offline spaces, and how activists are responding to this culture.
2. Feminists will gain greater knowledge and awareness of a range of activism taking place. This can help in brainstorming, networking, consciousness raising, and action.
3. Individuals who do not currently identify as feminists can use the project to learn more about various issues and potentially become involved.
4. Our project partners will benefit from increased visits to their websites.
5. The Feminist Library which is hosting our one-day symposium will increase visitor numbers.
6. Social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter will have documentation of sexism, harassment and misogyny being distributed through their platforms. This information can help them to respond and improve their policies around such content.
7. Policy makers such as the Home Office, Department of Culture, Media and Sport, and SCOOP, who are interested in issues related to ending violence against women and girls yet lack academically rigorous research findings on the nature of online misogyny as well as a systematic picture of the numerous strategies underway to combat this.
8. Charitable organisations like EVAW will have access to the academic research findings to support their media campaigns and government lobbying to protest violence against women and girls, rape culture and 'media sexism'.
 How They Will Benefit: 
1.By challenging hatred and violence against girls and women happening in new media spaces the project aims for enhanced quality of life of citizens (particularly feminists) but also the wider public and various stakeholders, who will gain a greater awareness of sexisms effects on society. They will also have a greater understanding of how online channels can be used to challenge this sexism, thereby directly contributing to the ideals of connected communities both nationally and internationally.
2. By providing a space to document digital feminist activism and providing a hub for some of the diverse activism that is taking place, the project is contributing to the construction of a more connected feminist community where academics work with, share and develop understandings with activists and other stakeholders who may not be directly in touch with academic communities otherwise.
3. Enhanced public knowledge about feminism to counter the notion that feminism is irrelevant or that young women are politically disengaged.
4. Enhanced public participation and engagement as the academic and feminist community become more aware of various campaigns.
5. Providing knowledge to inform new areas of research and fill a current gap in the academic literature. This will benefit academics, stakeholders and policy makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>109461</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>&quot;A Mobile Feminist Politics?

This talk examines the ways in which girls and women are using digital media platforms to challenge the rape culture they experience in their everyday lives; including street harassment, sexual assault, and the policing of the body and clothing in school settings. Focusing on three international cases, including the anti-street harassment site Hollaback!, the hashtag #BeenRapedNeverReported, and the Tumblr blog Who Needs Feminism? this paper asks three key questions: What experiences of harassment, misogyny and rape culture are girls and women responding to? How are girls and women using digital media technologies to document experiences of sexual violence, harassment, and sexism? And, why are girls and women choosing to mobilize digital media technologies in such a way? Employing an approach that includes ethnographic methods such as semi-structured interviews, content analysis, discursive textual analysis, and affect theories, we detail a range of ways that women and girls are using social media platforms to speak about, and thus make visible, experiences of rape culture. This paper argues that this digital mediation enables new connections previously unavailable to girls and women, allowing them to redraw the boundaries between themselves and others.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Rape Culture and the Media (London school visit)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5BE2D125-A487-4283-A52C-27C46A8BEA83</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brief presentation on 'rape culture and the media' to approximately 20 high school students who participate in a feminist lunch club at a school in North London.

However, less attention has been paid to the prevalence of rape and lad culture in secondary schools and the ways in which &amp;quot;popular misogyny&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;everyday sexism&amp;quot; proliferate in educational spaces and within teen peer sexual cultures. In this talk teen feminists and feminist academies present together about the experiences of working together in a London-based high school feminist club. We offer an analysis of the affects surrounding 'feeling feminism' suggesting the clubs provide a space for the girls to feel more safe, confident, angry and active within school environments often still hostile to feminism. We also demonstrate how these feelings are communicated beyond the groups via the girls' engagements in digital spaces, such as Facebook and Twitter. We discussed different modes of social media engagement and activism with the audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/news/events/2015/june/media-sexism-and-education-a-roundtable-panel-discussion</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented at International Association of Media and Communication Research titled: 'Documenting Digital Feminist Activism: Mapping Online Responses to Rape Culture through Hollaback and the Everyday Sexism Project'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5A5582C0-12E7-4DE9-B6A2-2A0994E987DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kaitlynn gave a paper titled: 'Documenting Digital Feminist Activism: Mapping Online Responses to Rape Culture through Hollaback and the Everyday Sexism Project' at the 2016 IAMCR conference at Leicester University, 26-31 July.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper titled: 'Rape Narratives and Digital Feminist Activism: A case study of #BeenRapedNeverReported, Hollaback!, The Everyday Sexism Project, and Who Needs Feminism?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7D7FEE63-BFA7-42B7-B4BC-0E5D29204287</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kaitlynn has been invited to an international workshop at Lund University, Sweden, titled: 'Intersectional Narratives of Rape' from 5-6 April.

We explore social media sites as spaces of potential activism (Hands, 2011) and of conflict and hostility expressed, for instance, through trolling and e-bile (Jane, 2014, Shaw, 2014, Rightler-McDaniels &amp;amp; Hendrikson, 2014). Drawing on theories of networked affect (Hills et al., 2015) we show how teen aged girls navigate a Twitter feminist community within and outside of school. We focus on experiences of challenging rape culture and experiences of trolling and online harassment, which involve both known and unknown audiences. We consider the tactics teen feminist employ to stay 'safe' online, including blocking, muting, deactivating and time away from internet. We also, however, document the ways teen feminists use social media like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr to directly challenge rape culture including online trolling, exploring the affective affordances of tweeting and posting including uses of hashtags, emojis, memes, images and more.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://viralcontagion.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/affect-and-social-media-symposium2-programme/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Teen girls' mediated feminist activism and sex education, Keynote speech at 'An International Symposium: Moving Forward: Identities, Sexting, Schooled Bodies, and the Curriculum that Frames Us'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA6D61C6-E122-4198-929D-FEC07E75CA38</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This international symposium being held at Western University in London Ontario Canada explores the content of sexuality education provision internationally. Various sectors of the government, NGO's, parents, community groups, teachers, schools and young people are often in sharp disagreement about what sexuality education should aim to cover and do. This international level of contestation is apparent in recent curricular developments to the Health and Physical Education curriculum (2015) in Ontario, Canada and has provoked a public outcry and in some cases, rallies to protest the revisions to the curriculum. In light of a public discomfort toward these curriculum revisions, and in relation to wider educational and sexuality debates that may shed light on recent events, the organizers (Dr. Michael Kehler-Western University, Ontario, Canada and Dr. Jessica Ringrose-University College London, Institute of Education, London, UK) are hosting an International Symposium: Moving Forward, at the Faculty of Education, London, Ontario, Canada, May 22-25, 2016.

For example, in the wake of our stakeholders meeting in April 2015, the stakeholder from the charity End Violence Against Women (EVAW) fed our project results back to the team which was then used with their 'Strategic Communications' work and thinking. This involves exploring segments of the population who are&amp;nbsp;on board with EVAW's messages, and which issues are strategically important. Although the 'impact' in this case is not necessarily tangible, our stakeholder from EVAW indicated that our research certainly provided concrete evidence about the importance of violence against women as a key feminist issue, and provided a hook through which to discuss who the organisation should be targeting and what their message should entail. 

Jessica Ringrose was invited to submit evidence to the Women and Equality Committee Sexual harassment and sexual violence in schools Inquiry http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmwomeq/826/826.pdf. She was also invited to the Advisory Committee, British Council Report Gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in the UK: Meeting the challenge of the Sustainable Development Goals https://www.britishcouncil.org/society/womens-and-girls-empowerment/gender-equality-uk. She also co-leads a Gender Equality Leadership in School (GELS) Network hosted by the Gender and Education Association, which connects schools with non-governmental organisations to promote gender equalities for young people across the UK http://www.genderandeducation.com/6462-2/

By working with secondary school teachers and key stakeholder groups such as UK Feminista and Fearless Futures around how to combat sexual violence including aspects of rape culture in schools members of the research team are building awareness of how to combat gender inequality, with case study examples and resources featured on the Gender and Education Association web site.

In response to the main findings of this project that schools are struggling to address everyday sexism and gender and sexual violence in school culture, Ringrose has applied and won Seed Funding from UCL IOE to explore schools understandings of these issues and how they are working to proactively address gender and sexual equality. The project encompasses:
1. a survey to find out about how schools are addressing gender/sexual equality in schools
2. a review of any groups or resources bought in to tackle these issues
3. Qualitative case study of best practice school (covers these issues in curriculum, extracurricular, behavioral policy - whole school approach)
4. Developing teacher guide/resource/toolkit 
5. Hosting a teacher, practitioner and stakeholder event/workshop to launch the resource

The project aims to have a direct societal and policy impact through development of Gender and Sexual Equality GASE Toolkit for UK schools and is also linked with a partner initiative in Cardiff University, AGENDA: A Young People's Guide to Making Positive Relationships Matter (Led by professor Emma Renold). Ringrose and Renold are teaming up to work on the teacher training and delivery of gender and sexual equality in schools across England and Wales.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C3F3DE12-D295-4D10-9E2B-5F2F4F0BAFD8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This year we have completed the research, published one peer-reviewed journal article, one special issue of a journal, and are now writing our book for Oxford University Press. In doing so, we are drawing from and contributing to new theoretical frameworks for understanding digital (feminist) activism, such as 'platform vernacular', 'affect', 'rape culture', 'popular feminism', and 'popular misogyny'. 
 
Specific project findings include:
 
1) Gendered violence remains a key priority for contemporary feminist activism, and requires ongoing policies and interventions.
 
2) Through engaging with digital feminist platforms, many of our participants (those who contribute to these sites) as well as organisers (those who founded, organise or run these sites) generated a 'feminist consciousness.' In other words, both participants and organizers who had not previous identified as &amp;quot;feminist&amp;quot; began to take on the label. Engaging with feminist politics online then can provide a mediated element to &amp;quot;feminist awakenings.&amp;quot; 
 
3) In speaking with over 50 participants, it is clear that the affective labour of doing digital feminist activism is real, overwhelming, and exhausting for both organizers and participants. 
 
4) There is a clear link between the anonymity afforded by many digital feminist campaigns and safety for some participants. Participants used anonymity as a factor when deciding how and where to participate in order to avoid judgment from family, friends, employers, acquaintances, and trolls. 
 
5) Certain platform cultures are 'friendlier' to different forms of feminism than others. For example, Tumblr was often regarded as a 'safe' space for feminist discussions, while Twitter was often regarded as inherently hostile, particularly for our teenage feminists. This highlights the importance of platform design for shaping the kinds of feminism that are made possible across different platforms. 
 
6) In some cases, social media functioned as a 'backchannel' to challenge institutionalized sexism. For example, some teen feminists used Twitter to challenge their principle or head teacher about school sexism and to raise questions about policies such as gendered dress codes or lack of teacher response to incidents of sexual harassment.
 
7) One of the greatest strengths noted by our participants is the urgency, immediacy, speed afforded by digital media to make 'real time' interventions into public debates, discussions, news, or policies. 
 
8) Another key strength of these digital feminist spaces is that they open up new opportunities for community formations - even with people from around the world with whom they have never met. This was particularly important for our participants in rural locations, or who live in culturally conservative nations.
 
9) Digital feminist platforms are key spaces to share experiences which are often otherwise 'unspeakable', or which they would have kept private. 
 
10) Our research contributes to a theorization of mediated 'liveliness' and new unprecedented connection. This finding builds on existing scholarship while reimagining this idea in relation to contemporary feminism. Not only is feminist activism now more visible within media culture, but we have demonstrated the affective nature of new forms of sharing, connection and solidarity previously impossible through speaking about experiences of rape culture. What is evident and remains to be explored further is the radical potential of digital culture to reanimate feminist politics online and off.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have evidence that our research is already making an impact in the field. To date, we have engaged in 30 engagement activities with many more lined up over the coming year. This engagement has spread beyond the UK to nations such as Canada, China, the US, Germany and Sweden. We are regularly being invited to present our findings from this research and have already made interventions into school training and provided reports to the UK Government advisory committees. Although only published in late 2016, our peer-reviewed journal article in The Journal of Gender Studies has already been downloaded over 1500 times, indicating the salience of this topic.

As the interview transcripts have now been archived at the Feminist Archive South, this also opens up the possibility of our research being used for media, educators and policy makers alike. Furthermore, our web-site www.digitalfeminism.co.uk presents neatly packaged 'case-studies' from our project which are easily digestible for academic and general audiences and highlight our key
