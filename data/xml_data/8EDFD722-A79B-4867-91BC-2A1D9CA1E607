North-East</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003054/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>'Records of Early English Drama North-East' (REED-NE) is part of a massive international project to assemble a complete record of surviving sources for medieval and early modern performance in Britain. REED volumes are to scholars in literature and theatre what Pevsner is to architects and art historians. REED's main office at the University of Toronto coordinates a team of researchers who trawl Britain's archives by region and edit their findings to an internationally recognized scholarly standard. The volumes which have already appeared have revolutionized our understanding of British performance history, replacing a view based largely on conjecture with one derived from detailed factual information about performers and the social and financial organisation of performance. REED volumes have redressed the London-centric imbalance of research obsessed by Shakespeare and his contemporaries, and drawn attention to the many forms of anonymous performance in regions which have often been unjustly seen as 'marginal'. REED-NE, the latest stage in the series, will find and edit all records pertaining to drama, music and ceremonial in England's North-East, from the earliest sources (around 9th century) to 1642. 

REED-NE will cover Yorkshire (excluding the city of York, whose records have already appeared), Durham and Northumberland, in a collection of five or more volumes published by Boydell. To date, discoveries include:
1. A medieval sequence of liturgy and drama about the Sacrament which linked the lay community with their ecclesiastical city governors (Durham). 
2. Child drama and misrule ceremonies (Boy Bishops and Lords of Misrule from Durham and West Yorkshire).
3. The earliest known evidence for three types of folk drama: the Stag Ceremony (before 1280, abolished 1315); the Plough Ceremony (from 1378); and the Man/Woman performer (1433-4) (all Durham).
4. New evidence relating to mystery cycles in at least four cities (Beverley, Doncaster, Durham and Newcastle). This will reduce the reliance of scholars on the probably untypical cycles from York and Chester.
5. A major stand-alone biblical play (Hull's 'Noah').
6. Rare evidence for a Paternoster play (Beverley). 
7. Performance traditions in noble households, including the Percies (Northumberland), the Ingrams, Talbots and Wentworths (West Yorkshire), and in the houses of lesser gentry in all North-Eastern counties.
8. An important body of information concerning illegal recusant drama in North Yorkshire. This will transform the historical understanding of the polemic use of drama by Catholics in provincial England.
9. A wealth of evidence about town waits, travelling performers, and patrons; we hope to discover and map performance circuits and locations from at least the later Middle Ages onwards. 
 
The REED-NE volumes will be accompanied by a Companion volume discussing the historical and cultural significance of our findings. 

Our findings will also be linked to an interactive map of provincial England on the REED Patrons and Performances website at Toronto. Geo-coding is only now being adopted for literary projects. Visualising research data with GIS mapping will offer a new perspective on historical performance in England and contribute to the advancement of the Spatial Humanities.

A summer festival in Durham in 2016 will showcase our research to academics and the wider public with a conference and an exhibition of objects and manuscripts pertaining to religious and secular drama at Durham's World Heritage Site. Based on our collected records, we will stage medieval and Renaissance repertoire at Durham Castle and the Cathedral. For the first time since the 9th century, the Lindisfarne 'Harrowing of Hell' - probably Britain's oldest surviving drama - will be performed. All events will be freely accessible. We expect our work to have a major impact, on our discipline worldwide, and also on regional communities and their awareness of their heritage.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We shall make the research results of REED-NE accessible to the general public through an exhibition, a performance festival and public talks. These will all be publicised through libraries, cultural centres, the Friends of Durham Cathedral, and the Little Theatres Guild of Great Britain. The University's PR Officer and the Director of the World Heritage Site will liaise with regional and national media. There will also be a designated, freely accessible project website, hosted by the Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Durham University, to give observers an opportunity to follow the progress of our research, and to publicise associated local initiatives; a comments facility will encourage feedback.

We expect specific opportunities to arise from REED-NE for a number of institutions and commercial interests in the North-East of England. For the third sector, a fuller picture of the history of performance in the region will be of benefit to museums and other institutions involved in cultural history (including those within Durham University, where our 2016 REED-NE exhibition will build on the successful 1992 University Library exhibition on Early Drama in Durham). The Durham World Heritage Site already enthusiastically supports the project (see their supporting letter). Our plans for an exhibition and a performance festival (see 'Objectives' and 'Summary' above) give an idea of possible third-sector activities elsewhere in the North-East. We expect this beneficial effect to extend beyond obviously historic towns like Durham and Beverley, to places whose importance to the history of performance is at present virtually unknown, such as Doncaster and Newcastle (which both had mystery cycles, including a surviving Newcastle play about the building of the Ark) and Hull (where an unusual Mariners' Play of Noah was once performed).

Secondly, there will be an opportunity to increase commercial activity by developing new tourist and performer-based attractions in the North-East. Some historically-based events already exist in the region (e.g. early music festivals in York and Hexham; the Lumi&amp;egrave;re Festival in Durham, which is inspired by Northumbria's Lindisfarne Gospels; and Durham's Mystery Plays of 2000 and 2010, which partly relied on work already done for the Durham REED volume). In Durham, the organisations which will benefit from an increase in visitor numbers during the festival include the Cathedral, the University (through lettings of college rooms), and hotels and other businesses in the city. There is undoubtedly scope for further comparable projects in other places throughout the North-East, but they are unlikely to spring up unless local communities can gain access to a better knowledge of their own cultural history. REED-NE will help to achieve this.

The project's most important legacy will be to give the communities of the North-East a heightened awareness of their own cultural past. We have already established links with local parishes and major churches, especially Durham Cathedral, where the Dean and Chapter have given the project warm support (see the accompanying letter from the Dean of Durham); the Cathedral Friends have hosted open lectures on the ongoing research for REED-NE, and are keen to hear of more discoveries. There are obvious opportunities for similar links to be developed with other major churches, such as Beverley, Hexham, Selby and Wakefield, and with local dramatic societies and other groups of performers. We have already given a popular open lecture to the annual conference of the Little Theatres Guild of Great Britain (2010), and are eager to pursue further opportunities of this kind.

In short, local response to REED-NE has been enthusiastic. Performance history is a crucial part of the heritage and collective memory of England's North-East, and the volumes published by REED-NE will provide ready access to that heritage for generations to come.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>785054</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A video in which members of the Durham REED N-E team (Barbara Ravelhofer, John McKinnell, Mark Chambers, Gasper Jakovac) present and discuss some of the evidence they have discovered for performance in the North-East of England up to 1642</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFB10496-3FFE-40DF-8457-908B73D9648F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Too soon to say, but this video is part of Durham University's commitment to clarity and open access in its research work; more specifically, it is designed to promote public interest in the historical culture of the region.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Records of Early English Drama North-East: Uncovering performance and musical heritage</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dur.ac.uk/research/news/item/?itemno=29126/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A free exhibition in the Nine Altars Chapel, Durham Cathedral (18th April - 21st May, 2016), co-ordinated by Diana Wyatt with contributions by Jamie Beckett, Mark Chambers, Gasper Jakovac, John McKinnell and Barbara Ravelhofer, presenting some of the evidence for performances of all kinds in the North-East of England up to 1642.

Through our website, a Durham University video describing the project, a wide variety of talks and podcasts, and interviews on BBC Radio Newcastle, BBC Television Newcastle and BBC Radio Humberside we have already promoted interest in the cultural history of the North-East, both throughout the region itself and in the world-wide academic community. It is too soon to say how the material we have discovered will be used by others in future, but every future academic study of early English drama will have to take account of it, and we hope that the people of the North-East will make good cultural use of it.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>05420689-E007-4B2F-8D5A-69BAA37EE889</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>It has become clear that early performance in the North-East was lively, various and very different from the traditional picture of medieval and early modern performance, which has tended to be dominated by what happened in London. Our proposal listed five objectives for the project:
1. To collect and publish all known surviving records of performance in the North-East of England up to 1642. This main objective is well advanced but not yet complete. The central REED organisation in Toronto has decided that future publication will be online and fully searchable, and the complications that result from this mean that the volumes for the North-East have had to take their places in a schedule which also includes many other counties. We have therefore decided to make the North-East performance records publicly available through pre-publication on our own website, and although this is time-consuming, we have already made available some of the West Yorkshire and County Durham records in this form. I will report on this objective in more detail next year, when its outcomes will be clearer.
2. We agreed to publish a volume of academic papers discussing early performance in the North-East; some of these will be revised versions of papers delivered at the REED North-East / Soci&amp;eacute;t&amp;eacute; Internationale pour l'Etude du Theatre Medievale Conference held in Durham in July 2016, while others result from discussions at our annual REED-E summer meetings (2014, 2015, 2017). We hope that this volume will be published by Durham University's Institute for Medieval and Early Modern Studies.
3. We undertook to mount a public exhibition illustrating the diversity of early performance in the North-East - this was successfully done: the exhibition, in the chapel of the Nine Altars in Durham Cathedral in April and May 2016, was visited by nearly 50,000 people and received many appreciative comments, besides giving the opportunity for five lunchtime talks, which are now available as podcasts on our website. We also agreed to host an international conference and drama festival of early drama, and these were held with great success in July 2016, with two sessions entirely devoted to drama and music from the North-East and a vibrant drama festival which included about a dozen different productions, including four from the North-East (The Lindisfarne Harrowing of Hell', the Durham Priory 'Peregrini', the York 'Crucifixion' and 'The Sacred and the Profane', a pageant which combined several types of performance that were current in the North-East in the early modern period; videos of all of them can be watched on our website). Our third objective has therefore been achieved with complete success.
4. We undertook to promote the regional cultural heritage of the region, and have energetically pursued this aim through workshops, talks and collaboration with local bodies, including Hexham Abbey Kirk Merrington Junior School and Washington Carnival, and through regional and wider publicity, including a freely available Durham University video and interviews with BBC Television North-East, BBC Radio Newcastle, BBC Radio Humberside and reports and pictures in local and regional newspapers. This cultural engagement, which goes hand in hand with a new concentration on intangible heritage in the promotion of Durham's World Heritage site, will continue after the formal end of the project in September 2018.
5. Our final objective was to further the career development of the younger members of the project. Dr. Chambers has been appointed joint editor with me of the REED volume for County Durham, and has become expert in the coding required for its publication; he has also gained experience and reputation as the main organiser of our 2016 conference. Our two PhD students (Mr. Gasper Jakovac and Mr. Jamie Beckett) are progressing well; both have delivered and published academic papers, and both will receive more specialised REED training during study visits to Toronto this summer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It now seems probable that 'The Sacred and the Profane' will become the focus of a summer festival which will help to engage the people of the North-East more closely in their cultural heritage; this festival will take place in Durham, perhaps once every three years. The more strictly academic side of the project will enable a more balanced picture of early performance in England as a whole; the records discovered so far will be of particular value in the study of folk performance, the relationship between drama and liturgy, the variety of modes of performance of mystery cycles and other biblical plays, the noble and civic patronage of early music, and the survival and extent of illegal recusant drama during and after the reformation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D3BD3EF1-DC54-4ECE-960D-C3163501EEC6</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://community.dur.ac.uk/reed.ne/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A database designed for public access, giving information about the REED North-East project and in particular about the early drama exhibition and festival which will take place in Durham in 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BCD9AC50-0925-4037-8A1C-7F2A1A1B6991</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is too soon to give a complete description of this, but it has already resulted in recruitment of local members of the public to take part in liturgical drama productions and workshops on renaissance dance.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Theatrum Mundi</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>A publicly accessible source of information on all aspects of the project, to which pre-publication data on performance in the North East up to 1642 is being added as rapidly as possible.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE920E73-67CD-4F97-BFA6-2FD756C1D4C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers will be able to access the latest discoveries as soon as possible; the site includes a 'flower of the month' entry which changes every month, containing a new record which can be expected to engage the general public.
