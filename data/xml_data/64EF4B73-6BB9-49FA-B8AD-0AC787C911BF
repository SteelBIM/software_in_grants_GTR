The first considers the identification of high ability children attending schools in slums of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Objective one studies the current identification process within 50-60 schools with children in grade six. Teachers will be asked to identify children they believe are high ability providing reasons why. It will be observed whether the current identification process is biased towards any particular gender or cultural norms. All grade six children in the 50-60 schools will be given a battery of standard tests utilised to identify giftedness along with English, mathematics and Kiswahili tests. A comparison will be carried out looking for any correlations between those identified by the schools, parents, peers and communities, and those by the tests. Other questions explored will include children?s self-perception of their own ?ability?.&lt;br />&lt;br />Objective two considers the creation of an accurate/cost-efficient identification process for teachers and school managers, enabling them to effectively identify high ability children. The third investigates the possibility of enriching and accelerating learning by designing and developing a framework for running a ?Saturday Scholar Program?. The final part is the dissemination of the findings to educators, policy makers, governments, opinion formers, and relevant stakeholders.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 
This research programme aims to fill important gaps in our understanding regarding the identification of high ability children as well as the interactions between these students, their peers, their teachers, the community and learning and leadership through new pedagogical interfaces. This research will inform policy makers, practitioners, teachers and psychologists who are dealing with high ability children and their possible contribution to others, including poverty alleviation. The results will also interest school owners and parents as well as organisations interested in the development of pedagogy around peer learning and those considering the contributions high ability children can make to others in their communities. Finally, this research represents a significant step towards furthering our understanding of the effects of the identification and nurturing of high ability children which is anticipated to benefit a range of social science disciplines, and address some fundamental social issues that are of interest to the general public and policy makers both in developing countries as well as at the development agency level. 
How will they benefit from this research?
Our study will benefit those considering the contribution of the identification and nurturing of high ability children and the contribution they can make to their society. What will also be considered is how this information can assist the understanding of teachers and educational and applied psychologists, educational policy makers as well as providing a blue print for the identification and nurturing of high ability children in slum areas of developing countries, thus highlighting the need to measure ability for both genders rather than relying upon what is conventional in development settings. Parents and teachers of high ability children as well as aid agencies, NGOs, governments and education departments in both the UK and Tanzania and internationally will gain a richer understanding of the impact high ability children once identified can make on their communities and peers. 
What will be done to ensure that they have the opportunity to benefit from this research?
We will disseminate our findings to practitioners, education professional, governments and aid agencies by presenting at major international conferences as well as to DfID, and the Tanzania education department. We will also submit at least tow papers for publication to well respected journal in the field, such as the International Journal of Development, Gifted Education Quarterly, and Comparative Education. Moreover, we will communicate our findings to individuals and organizations interested in the development of high ability children by presenting our findings at established workshop series and lecture series. We will also present through public lectures and workshops, and the PI will aim to report on the outcomes of the project, in a non-technical form, through a TED talk and on Youtube. We will also post our findings on the E.G. West Centre's website (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/egest). This is specifically designed to give information in a wider from to a wider public. We will further publicise our results to the general public by issuing and sending a press release to potential interested media (BBC, respectable local and national newspapers, popular science websites) via Newcastle University's Press Office.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>78325</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open University of Tanzania</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Tanzania, United Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Open University of Tanzania</gtr:description><gtr:id>7096A61E-711A-407B-9816-CAB40AD75DB9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2015 we are in discussion with OUT to hold a policy event and conference around the impact of the research</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Supported and facilitated initial contact as well as providing local knowledge of schools and districts.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Training of data collectors at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT), Dar Es Salaam.

Schools indicated they were very interested in the results and were thinking about new ways to identify and nurture children that could contribute more not only to their school but also their community. 

The finding were reported in the ESRC Society Now publication for Spring 2016 - 'Africa overlooks 'slum superstar'' - and the PI (Prof Dixon) has since had several emails from developing countries (including Kenya and Tanzania) regarding advice around providing gifted education for children from slums such as Kibera Nairobi. 

A Conversation article was written (Gifted children in Africa's urban slums are a precious and untapped resource; May 2016) and again the researcher from the bid (Steve Humble) received several emails regarding possible sponsorships for gifted children living in poor areas of Sub-Saharan Africa from different charitable organisations. 

There is continued interest around the TEDx Newcastle talk - Slum Superstars - given by Steve Humble and we are still in discussion with a film company from Tanzania about making a documentary for possible showing in the US/UK/Africa. We will pursue this as we believe this could highlight the findings and ideas more providing more impact pathways.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3B3BB792-E376-4B69-BDB9-DAE7F9CB85E0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Data were collected from 24 teachers, 1,857 children (classes 4-5), 17 government schools as well as just under 200 parents in order to consider how giftedness is regarded currently in a low income setting in Dar Es Salaam. An investigation took place to see if there were any correlations between those children who were shown to be potentially gifted through the multidimensional approach used in the research and the different participants' beliefs. Children undertook IQ tests (three different types to three different cohorts to see if administration (whole class of individual) made any differences to outcomes) maths, English reading and Kiswahili tests as well as answered questions on background and their self perception of their own giftedness. The children were also asked to identify three children in their class they thought were gifted giving the reasons why. Teachers and parents were asked to identify children they believed were gifted also giving their thoughts and beliefs around giftedness. One of the most significant findings was that parents felt differently to teachers about what giftedness was and how it could be identified. In the main parents believed giftedness to be associated with creativity, being wise and curious. They also felt these 'gifts' would benefit society. Teachers believed giftedness was more about test taking as well as the ability of children to teach and take charge of the class whilst the teacher carried out other activities. Children associated giftedness with reading ability and being clever at school. We postulate that the findings broadly agree with the literature that intelligence in sub-Saharan Africa is regarded essentially as a social construct, and is socially oriented behaviour that benefits a collective society. Methods that were used seemed to consistently identify the same children as gifted. A &amp;quot;Sieve&amp;quot; test was developed made up of questions that were shown to be more positively correlated for those identified as gifted from the process. This was trialled on a subset of the 1,857 who were identified as gifted and shown to be an effective identification process that could be used in the field. However it was also felt that some of the tests, although working in such an urban setting, may not be totally cross culturally transportable and that additional ways to investigate giftedness in such a different culture could be included in further exploration of its meaning and identification. A &amp;quot;Saturday Scholar Program&amp;quot; was trialled and shown to be very successful with children of all levels using handheld devices and ideas around self organised learning systems. Dissemination has been very successful and is continuing. Feedback has been given to the schools that took part. One of the research team has undertaken a TEDx talk around the research findings. Talks have also been given to policy makers, academics, students, researchers, the general public as well as opinion formers including at Stanford University, University of Connecticut and at THINK! held in the Royal Geographical Society, London. The findings have featured in the media including Kilimanjaro Radio and the Neo Magazine Stockholm.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research findings and outcomes will have impact on policy, practice as well as society. Our findings show there are potentially gifted children in very poor parts of the Kinondoni district of Dar Es Salaam. Previous to our research some educational officials as well as teachers held the belief that poor children could not be gifted. Networks have been built with academics and researchers in Dar Es Salaam who it is felt could help develop policy within this area. As very little research has been carried out in this area this sets up seminal research that could be taken forward by others. The research had immediate positive impact on the research participants, those taking the tests as well as participating in the &amp;quot;Saturday Scholar Program&amp;quot;. The dissemination of the results has also had impact on those who look at giftedness in western settings and may inspire them to take forward not only the identification part, but the whole school enrichment idea. It is important for this work to continue, as too few development experts believe that part of the solution to poverty can come from the poor themselves. Yet our research there is a waste of human capital if the resource of gifted children remains untapped.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9B53A85B-6600-4ED0-8700-1447D9C3B307</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7GPggyFEos</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This research data base consists of student outcomes, backgrounds and self perceptions.
