&lt;p>After having been marginalised for half a century, UA is encountering a great resurgence in popularity in the cities of the Global North. Community groups, social enterprises and guerrilla gardeners are promoting food growing in a wide range of unusual contexts: public space and housing estates, brown fields and rooftops, window sills and parish greens.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Despite being generally portrayed as:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>benevolent and unproblematic, with the potential to partially solve problems associated with food quality and affordability&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>contribute to reduced ecological footprints&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>increase community cohesion&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>achieve greater community resilience to the economic crisis&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>promote urban sustainability.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>UA raises many controversial and potentially unjust dynamics, which lie unexplored.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research will be the first academic investigation into UA as a social practice in UK, investigating its cultural, social and institutional dimensions and will experiment with a creation of a social platform (a forum) where urban agriculturalists and policy makers can jointly discuss which resources, skills, infrastructural and regulative models are needed to ensure socially and environmentally just urban agricultural practices in the Leeds City Region context.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>81605</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is the presentation given by Andre Viljoen at the launch event of &amp;quot;Urban Food Justice.

Participants and Feed Leeds members recognised the need to organise a second, more in-depth meeting to take this initial outcomes forward. A draft report of this initiative has been given to council officers in the Public Health sector that have required further elaboration on the proposal.
The draft has evolved in a 4 pages support document that has been presented in a delegation to Leeds City Council, on the 10th of September 2014. The delegation asked a commitment (i.e. dedicated officers across the sectors) from Leeds City Council to take part in a working group to design a new sustainable food strategy for the city.

We then had small groups discussions exploring incentives, constraints and foreseeable scenarios of extensive urban edible spaces.

The PI has established contacts with nation-wide initiative &amp;quot;Incredible Edible Todmorden&amp;quot;.

During this workshop, community groups had the chance to draft plans for community-run activities and sensitising events in public space, around urban agriculture and sustainable food, and to discuss any doubt/concern arising from the new council regulation on this matter. 
Other participants had also the opportunity to get inspiration from the projects presented and to plan new initiatives.

Urban agriculture and local food growing has actually to deal with contamination and soil fertility. Speakers from Leeds City Council, grassroots community groups, local businesses and third sector organisations gave us an overview of how we can improve soil structure and deal with urban contaminants in an accessible way, while also dealing with greenhouse gasses emissions. The workshop included practical demonstrations and hands-on activities.

Participants have expressed positive feedback related to the learning experience and have expressed interest in constituting a &amp;quot;soil quality support group&amp;quot;. They have been contacted again later on to support this.

The workshop was participated by a number of health professionals working across sectors in the council or within third sector organisations working in partnership with the Public Health department on issue of food and nutrition.
The audience raised many questions and asked for further information during and after the workshop (research reports produced by the research have been disseminated by Public Health (workshop organisers) and the PI has provided further ad hoc information.

After the presentation of some of the main outcomes of the discussions held during last year, the participants had the opportunity to feed back on this initiative and discuss if and how to take it forward, and what policy outcomes could be expected. 
Feedback has been very positive, remarking the appreciation for the incremental approached adopted in designing the workshops (linking each discussion and leading towards a progression in skills building and policy impact). One year on from the launch, Feed Leeds is now an independent organisation, and many participants to the social platform events are also FL members. However, the learning element of the UFJ platform has been recognised as a key driver, and stronger motivator for attendance. Many participants have expressed interest in volunteering - if needed - to ensure the continuation of this experience.

A number of council officers have taken part in this event and provided support to take some of the ambitions expressed in the workshops forward, to the political arena.
In particular, council officers from Public Health have asked me to prepare a document for the Director of Public Health with a summary of the proposed policy directions. This has instigated collaboration and feedback over the preparation of the document, that has been presented at Leeds City Council In September 2014 and accepted unanimously by the 99 Councillors.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.urbanfoodjustice.org/social-platform/conclusions/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Urban Food Justice - Workshop 7 - The economic viability of urban agriculture</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>430F4B72-17C4-43CA-B8F8-E8C639F71A4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Participants engagegd in questions and drafted a 'wish' plan for the constitution of a local food hub.

This project is currently seeking funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:presentationType>paper presentation</gtr:presentationType><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://foodjustice2014.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/tornaghi.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>45000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Urban transformations.

1) Policy - Following the delivery of the draft of the  (see publications) to some council officer within Leeds City Council, I have been invited to prepare a document for the Director of Public Health, and later to prepare a supporting document for a Delegation to Leeds City Council. The delegation was lead by Feed Leeds, a third Sector umbrella organisation were I act as Secretary, which I have co-founded and that was launched and consolidated through the Urban Food Justice social platform. The delegation was asking the establishment of a working group for the establishment of a Sustainable Food Strategy for the city of Leeds, and the request was approved unanimously by the 99 Councillors on the 10th of September 2014.

2) The article ; has been featured on a number of blogs and websites immediately after its publication and to date it is still the most read article of the journal (Progress in Human Geography - ranked 2nd in the impact factor in human geography journals).
See for example here:

and here: 
http://www.citeulike.org/group/15407/author/Tornaghi:C

3) The  produced through this research has been distributed to public health workers following an invited presentation given to an educational workshop organised by the Public Health Services (Leeds City Council), where feedback from participants was excellent and people asked for specific guiding documents where to read more about the topic.

4) A number of academics, following the publication of the article in Progress, have been in touch asking for further elaboration of the concepts, tailored to their specific projects (i.e. an Italian journal for planners - declined due to short deadline - and an international handbook on food and the environment - accepted). A major publisher, Springer, has also been in touch inviting me to submit a book proposal for their Future Cities series).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3753334A-E9DA-47BA-8B33-2734A0FD14AA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) The research undertook an exploration of emerging urban agricultural practices across the UK and identified a range of motivations, values and claims associated with them. These can be clustered in three groups: 
i) Socio-environmental justice. Many individuals working/volunteering in these projects are driven by an environmental ethic, and are concerned about climate change, world food regimes, exploitation of people/natural resources, and ultimately food sovereignty.
ii) 'Green' jobs. A rising number of projects emerge out of a new awareness that funding is now available in this sector. This is especially the case of: a) artists, previously employed in the performing or public art sectors, and b) the public health sector that out of necessity - drastic cuts to public funding - looks for alternative ways of mobilizing &amp;quot;the Big Society&amp;quot; around health education and social cohesion. 
iii) The search for new community ties is also a goal, but usually comes associated with ideas about neighbourhood regeneration, beautification of derelict sites and in general a will to impact and claim ownership of the local environment.
More details are available in the publications associated to this research. 

2) The research has identified a number of exclusionary mechanisms related to food growing, for example:
- The urban poor and people in food deserts, who are the ones who most need to access land for growing food often lack the capacity and resources (time, skills,) to navigate the system and benefit from existing opportunities
- Vocational low income people, who are actually growing their own food to contribute to their family economy are increasingly experiencing obstacles due to austerity, corporate management and increase in land rents.
- Across all the categories of growers, there is perception of lack of skills/time to transform the harvest into food: as a consequence, much of the food grown is not harvested or is wasted at home.
- A range of UA advocates, knowingly or unknowingly, promote UA that contributes to dismantling the welfare state, advocating regressive self-sufficiency models and promoting further enclosures of the commons in the name of the 'big society'. 
A detailed discussion is available in &amp;quot;Critical geography of urban agriculture&amp;quot;, published in Progress in Human Geography (2014) and in the paper &amp;quot;Urban Agriculture in the food-disabling city: (Re) defining urban food justice, reimagining a politics of empowerment&amp;quot; published in Antipode(2016);
3) The project has identified a range of opportunities and constraints around issues of land access, competing claims on land and the externality effects of UA that represent policy challenges. These are discussed in the research report 'policy brief'.

4) The project has created the Urban Food Justice social platform, aimed at bringing together different stakeholders in critical dialogue and action. This consisted of 11 learning events co-designed/co-facilitated with local stakeholders and participated by over 90 individuals. The platform has been key in the establishment of a number of initiatives, for example, the umbrella organisation Feed Leeds (www.feedleeds.org), a soil quality network, a working group aiming to establish a Leeds Food Hub, a working group for the creation of a city wide Leeds Sustainable Food Strategy.

5) The project has contributed to the establishment of a new branch of geography: a critical geography of urban agriculture. The key publication of this project (published in Progress in Human Geography in February 2014) has received more than 80 citations within the first three years from its publication.) Following the publication of this article, the author has been invited to a number of academic fora to present research or give keynote speeches.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I have published a paper highlighting how my explorative research lead to a new research agenda for a critical geography of urban agriculture. This is the most read paper of the journal (Progress in Human Geography, which is one of the top human geography journals).
I have also been invited to write an entry for the Wiley Encyclopedia of Urban and Regional Studies on &amp;quot;Community gardening&amp;quot; and for an International Handbook on food and environment which will be very important ways of disseminating results. 
Findings can be put into practice by using the policy brief and community guide published on the project's website (Urbanfoodjustice.org).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>3200D1DD-FCBC-4C30-8DFF-8441BB642A5E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.urbanfoodjustice.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation of a delegation to Leeds City Council and consequent establishment of a City Council led working group (in partnership with third sector organisations) aimed at developing a Sustainable Food Strategy in Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FDACBEA1-18F0-431D-95C3-DDF3FE1EC715</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Document for the Director of Public Health</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6379D451-B9B3-41FD-87B8-B9F98724C481</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In November 2013 I have been invited to prepare a document for the Director of Public Health summarising the main policy direction emerging from my research.
