Cell migration is fundamental for the development of organisms, wound healing, and the immune respose in the body. All these physiological processes are regulated by the interaction of the cell with its environment. The major group of molecules controlling these interactions are cell surface proteins called integrins. Integrins span the cell membrane and are able to attach with their extracellular part to proteins located in the outside surrounding of the cell (extracellular matrix). With their intracellular part, integrins associate with proteins that link them to the cells' highly flexible and dynamic skeleton (actin cytoskeleton). The interaction of integrins with the cytoskeleton is indirect. One of the key molecules, which control the link between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton, is named 'vinculin'. Mice lacking this protein die early during development, and cells deficient in vinculin are highly metastatic. Vinculin is able to interact with 11 other proteins, which have the potential to exert important signals regulating the cell communication with its environment. My aim is to understand how vinculin coordinates the numerous signals and thus modulates the communications between the cell and its outside surroundings. We will explore the function of vinculin by visualizing and monitoring its dynamic behaviour and interactions with other proteins in live cells using advanced imaging techniques. We will genetically modify vinculin and its ability to interact with its potential binding partners and thus test how vinculin controls a network of signals that is important for coordinated cell migration. For coordinated cell movements, the cell needs to exert pulling forces on the extracellular environment. Our recent discoveries suggest that vinculin interactions with the contractile skeleton in the cell are essential for the transmission of forces to the integrins that bind with its extracellular part to the extracellular matrix. Using highly developed nanotechnological devices, we will determine how vinculin signals contribute to such force transmission from the interior to the outside of the cell. Using devices that will mimic forces in the cells outer environment (such as pressure, stretching and shear forces in the body), we will be able to test how vinculin transfers signals from the outside of the cell to the inside cytoskeleton. The outcome of this study will provide us with important information for the better understanding of how cell motility is regulated in health and disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The primary sites for cell adhesion to the substrate are focal adhesions (FA). At FAs, over 100 molecules regulate the link of integrins to the actomyosin force machinery. FAs are therefore molecular entities that regulate cell motility as well as the transmission of forces to the substrate, and vice versa. Here I seek support to define and integrate the contribution of vinculin, a central player for focal adhesion regulation. Vinculin in its active state has the potential to bind 11 other FA components, which in turn have multiple binding partners. With its prominent binding sites for talin and actin, vinculin is located at the interface between adhesion receptors (integrins) and the actin cytoskeleton and thus in an ideal position to coordinate a network of signals regulating cell motility. I aim to understand how vinculin and its multiple interaction partners (a) control cell adhesion and motility and (b) how they are involved in the transmission of forces. To date, protein interaction studies in FAs have relied mostly on biochemical analyses, which are unable to probe the enormously complex and dynamic events that occur in cells. We will capitalise on my knowledge on advanced fluorescence microscopy, including fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), quantitative image correlation analysis (ICA), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), as an essential tool for overcoming some of these barriers. We will complement these techniques with biochemisty and (nano-) technological devices that allow application and measurement of forces to elucidate: 1) How does vinculin control the large network of signals in focal adhesions? 2) How do interaction partners of vinculin vary in time and space? How is vinculin involved in sensing of extracellular forces, the generation of intracellular force, and the regulation of adhesion and migration?</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-01-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-01-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>403066</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Artistic prints or scientific images.</gtr:description><gtr:id>96741F75-5881-4546-AAAE-5CA5228DEB2D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Engaging the public; see movie on provided link with participation of C.Ballestrem.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Arts exhibition &quot;Immortality&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Images were provided for an arts exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>21221B3E-C845-412F-A1C7-BA11B361C00D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Informing and stimulating thoughts about the role of cells and their ability to communicate with their environment in health and disease.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Images of the micro world of cells.</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Participating with images of cells which were screen printed in collaboration with Sally Gilford at an arts gallery exhibition called &amp;quot;Immortality II&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0D53B7E-F9DD-4F44-8BB3-BB2116A43162</gtr:id><gtr:impact>knowledge to the general public audience; stimulating thoughts about health and disease; artistic value;</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Arts exhibition &quot;Immortality II&quot;</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visits (different Manchester schools)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>30C8FD54-C406-4B36-B301-160C84FA53B9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>mentoring sparked questions and discussions.

(1) Health care sector: the company &amp;quot;Smith and Nephews&amp;quot; had contacted us to examine how the molecular mechanism we revealed are implicated in Ultrasound mediated wound healing. This has lead to BBSRC supported CASE funding (ongoing project) where we aim to reveal signalling events that will lead to data that can improve wound healing. 

Our findings have further attracted BBSRC CASE funding from Intelligent Imaging Innovations (3i), with whom we helped to improve fluorescence energy transfer readouts using advanced microscopy. 

(2) Education: We engage in school education (Wellcome to the Matrix) where pupils form different schools are invited to learn about the cells interaction of cells with the matrix. Our lab also hosts selected highly gifted pupils from high school. Both events are coordinated by Ceri Harrop in the Wellcome Trust Centre for Cell-Matrix Research of which the our group is member of.

(3) Society: We participate in arts exhibitions where we provide images to reveal the microscopic beauty of life on one hand and on the other hand important aspects in health and disease.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2005</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EC409532-074E-4FD7-8F55-F2AD7C2EC549</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our main aim was to deepen the understanding of how cells sense their environment, which enables them to react to mechanical and biochemical signals. Our data demonstrate that vinculin, a core protein of focal adhesions - the primary interaction sites of cells with their extracellular environment-, controls the link between adhesion receptors (integrins) and the actin cytoskeleton. Our data indicate that vinculin regulates coupling and uncoupling events between integrins and the actin cytoskeleton as well as the recruitment and release of focal adhesion components; both are required for coordinated cell migration. Our main achievements are detailed below.

- We identified vinculin as a major coordinator of stretch induced signaling. We followed changes of intracellular structures such as actin, microtubules, and cell matrix interactions (focal adhesions, FA) in time and space and showed that mechanical forces activated signals that in conjunction with the actin cytoskeleton lead to force induced reorganization of cells and cell-matrix adhesion sites (Goldyn et al, JCS 2009; Goldyn et al, Cytoskeleton 2010). We then revealed that without vinculin the response of cells to forces is perturbed and the binding of vinculin to the actin cytoskeleton is important for its function in transducing mechanical signals (Carisey et al., JCB, manuscript under review).

- Vinculin coordinates cell adhesion and migration through its activation of the talin/integrin complex. Using Atomic force spectroscopy to measure adhesion we show that vinculin through its interaction with talin regulates the activation status of integrins. Cells expressing constitutively active forms of vinculin adhere stronger and thereby inhibit cell migration (Carisey et al., Current Biology, 2013).

- Vinculin controls the recruitment and the release of FA proteins. A variety of mutant forms of vinculin have enabled us to identify which proteins are recruited though direct binding or indirect signals to FAs (Carisey et al., Current Biology 2013). The interaction of vinculin with talin was key for vinculin recruitment itself (Wang et al, JCB 2011) and key for its downstream action in FAs. We identified which of thee clusters of binding sites for vinculin on talin are crucial for vinculin function (manuscript in preparation).

- We elucidated the role of vinculin in regulating the dynamcis of a network of focal adhesion proteins. The dramatic impact of active vinculin on the dynamic turnover of its binding partner talin depended largely on the presence of two vinculin interaction sites. (Carisey et al. Methods Mol Biol. 2011; manuscript in preparation). 

- We determined the relationship of vinculin with paxillin and showed the differential interaction of vinculin with paxillin or Hic5 depending on the balance between Rac1 and RhoA activity (Deakin et al, PLOS one 2012). 



- We elucidated how vinculin regulates cellular elasticity a parameter that has been show be an important parameter to detect cancerous cells; cancer cells are softer than normal cells. Cells without vinculin or cells with vinulin lacking the link to the actin cytoskeleton are softer. (Nijenhuis et al, Biohysical Journal 2014).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academically:
We revealed key aspects of how cells sense their environments and respond to extracellular mechanical and biochemical signals. These signals determine whether a cell migrates, stays in a resting phase or proliferates. 

 We now build on our discoveries by exploring further molecular details that will enable us understand:
1) how the sensing machinery is regulating neuronal behaviour and their sensing of mechanical properties of their extracellular environment (grant proposal submitted to BBSRC Sept 2014).

2) how the dynamic system of molecular activation and deactivation processes control cell adhesion and migration 
(grant application to BBSRC for submission 2014in preparation). 

3) how we can interfere with protein-protein interactions in order to manipulate cell adhesion and motility. For this we have set up collaborations that will lead to a multidisciplinary grant proposal involving the structural determination of the vinculin binding partner talin, the functional analysis of talin binding to its partners in cells, and the production of synthetic compounds which aim to modify molecular interactions thus enabling us to direct cell motility and proliferation. We hope that such cell permeable synthetic compounds will allow us to direct cell function and in future may thus serve as drug leads.

For education:
One of the major uses is in making the public understanding of how the body, i.e. cells in the body function. Students of the lab therefore participate in &amp;quot;Wellcome to the matrix events&amp;quot; for invited schools (http://www.wtccmr.manchester.ac.uk/forthepublic/events/matrix/). 

Our images of dynamic cells are not only of scientific interest, but also beautiful. Therefore we selected images for presentation at the arts exhibition &amp;quot;All About Us&amp;quot; in February 2011 in Bristol. Another arts exhibition is currently planned for March 2015.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>696198A0-11CF-432B-876F-3889050CD248</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ballestremlab.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication
