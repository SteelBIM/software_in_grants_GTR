Project</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/I03002X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and very likely due to the increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. CO2 is the most important and fastest-growing greenhouse gas. It is released to the atmosphere mainly by the burning of fossil fuel from human activities and by deforestation. Governments around the world have pledged to limit global warming to 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to current knowledge, such a commitment requires that the global emissions of CO2 peak at the latest between 2015 and 2020, and decrease sharply afterwards.

The political discussions to develop an international agreement that would limit global warming are based on scientific knowledge provided by the international community. Key to those discussions is the provision of the latest up to date information, and the transparency of the scientific debate and information. The Global Carbon Project (GCP), established in 2001, coordinates international research on the carbon cycle. Since 2004, the GCP with the support of the community has compiled, analysed and published information on the &amp;quot;global CO2 budget&amp;quot;, including the CO2 emissions and their partitioning among the atmosphere, ocean and land reservoirs. This effort has provided tremendous information to help the policy process and the public understand the human and natural factors that control the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. 

The annual CO2 budget has growth beyond the capacity of the GCP. At the same time, the demand is growing for more and better information, more background supporting material, more transparency in the methods and process, and traceability of the information. The community is trying to organise itself further to support this important effort. 

This proposal aims to establish an office of the GCP in at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research of the University of East Anglia. This location would be ideal to support the publication of the annual CO2 budget because of its already well-established research on the carbon cycle, the strength and complementary work done in its existing programmes, and its unparallelled record of providing high quality policy-relevant science to UK and international policymakers. The UK GCP office would provide key support, and further credibility and visibility to the annual CO2 budget.

Scientists have begun to think about how to produce carbon information services to assist in the necessary transition towards a low-carbon economy. One way proposed by the GCP is to institutionalise the more operational aspects of the GCP activities, such as the publication of CO2 budgets, through the establishment of an International Carbon Office. The development of such an ambitious project needs careful thinking and strong commitment from stakeholders. The UK GCP office would work with existing organisations to establish the structural basis of an ICO and determine its potential and viability in the long term.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal will continue and enhance previous efforts by the Global Carbon Project to publish annual emissions and sinks of carbon dioxide. This information is highly relevant to policy makers, businesses and the public. Our experience from previous years has shown that publishing results in high impact journals was the best way to ensure that our results receive the largest possible press coverage and visibility. We will thus focus on the quality of our products, and work together with the Project Partners to produce such high-impact publications each year. We will accompany our publications with coordinated press releases, translated in other languages as the team can support, and distribute them through our established networks. We will make ourselves available for press interviews and for discussions with policy advisors.

Furthermore, we plan to attend upcoming Conferences of the UNFCCC and to present and publicise our results, and to seek opportunities to meet policy makers in the UK and elsewhere.

Several of the GCP scientists are authors on the upcoming assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). We thus have a direct route by which our results can inform other scientists and the policy environment.

Finally, the web site of the Global Carbon Project receives several hundreds of hits every day. We will thus ensure that our results are fully available, and that highlights are clearly visible and understandable to a wide audience.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Infographic summarising the main findings of the Global Carbon Budget 2015</gtr:description><gtr:id>02BC78A4-E827-404F-B66A-F2B5DF3BDBE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impactful and useful graphic reference for the Global Carbon Budget 2015.

A poster of the infographic was displayed during the second week of COP21 (once the embargo was lifted).

This is an update of emissions of carbon dioxide and where they go in the environment.

This below is one of a series of three images commissioned to accompany the 2014 Global Carbon Budget Report, which is published today - right now, in fact. Among other things the report outlines the planet's carbon emissions over the last year and the implications for both society and the climate.

The images constitute somewhat of an experiment for the team behind the report, as cartoons have not been used to communicate the research before. There's an interesting article here unpicking in more detail what the images represent, and also discussing the potential for cartoons to provide an effective alternative/complement to diagrams as a means of communicating complex ideas in simplified form. In fact, if you follow the link you are also invited to offer your own thoughts on whether you feel the experiment has worked So do cartoons have a place in scientific research? What might they offer that diagrams can't, and vice versa?

The press releases/press conference was designed to fit into the UNFCCC COP21 narrative and timed to give the the media covering events in Paris an interesting news story related to emissions at the beginning of the second week of the COP. It was very successful in this regard. Huge media interest in this story and truly global coverage was achieved.

One day after the release of the Global Carbon Budget 2013 we ran a very successful side event at COP19.
Summary
Global CO2 emissions reached a record high in 2012. We present data from the Global Carbon Budget 2013 which reinforces conclusions that emissions are inline with a 4 to 6&amp;deg;C rise by 2100, but also demonstrates how radical mitigation could yet deliver a 2&amp;deg;C and climate-resilient future. 
Speakers: Dr Glen Peters Global Carbon Project/CICERO Prof Pierre Friedlingstein Global Carbon Project/University of Essex, Dr Roisin Moriarty Global Carbon Project/Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research/University of East Anglia, Dr Alice Bows &amp;amp; Prof Kevin Anderson Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research/University of Manchester

We presented the latest analysis of the Global Carbon Budget to year 2016 and their drivers, including the drivers of emission reductions in the many countries that have already peaked and the latest trends in China's emissions. We show recent analysis of potential for negative emissions at large scale (e.g. BECCS). We discuss the feasibility of keeping global warming well below 2&amp;deg;C or 1.5&amp;deg;C in light of these latest findings.

They like and enjoy having CO2 emissions data from human actvites at their finger tips (free) and how they are free to ask their own questions and find the answers. It puts a global (country by country) dataset in the hands of the public and those policy makers working for NGOs helping them to inform themselves (and others) and make decisions based on the most robust and up to data CO2 emissions data available. This web based application has definatly sparked questions and discussion around CO2 emissions and what is to be done about their constant increase.

People want to know 
1) when the data will be updated
2) how to access the scientific studies behind the numbers (all referenced on the website)
They also want to express their gratitude for making the data available and in such a user friendly way. 
Colleagues around the world are also using the Carbon Atlas as material in their university lectures and projects.

This effort greatly helps strengthen the global carbon cycle science community and enhance the international effort to support the climate policy process in a timely fashion.

In the 2014 edition of the Global Carbon Budget, we showed that carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuel and cement production, the main contributor to global climate change, continued to grow at a high pace of 2.5% per year on average in the past decade. Keeping warming below two degrees requires that the total amount of CO2 emissions remain below a fixed 'quota'. We showed that with the recent growth in emissions, we have already burned two thirds of the quota to keep warming below two degrees with a likely probability (66% chance).

We also conducted an analysis of what is mathematically feasible in terms of sharing a quota on carbon emissions among world countries, and shows that to keep to two degrees, global emissions reductions over the next several decades need to be over 5% per year. We also compared the remaining carbon quota to fossil fuel reserves, and showed that the reserves are at least three times larger than the quota, impliying that some of the reserves will need to remain untapped to keep average warming below two degrees. One of the key uncertainties is the future availability of 'negative emissions' technology, i.e. the removal of carbon using bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), but the credibility of such technology is unproven.

We also scrutinised the CO2 emissions of land-use change and the partitioning of the total emissions among the atmopshere, land and oceans, and showed the continued growth in all components of the carbon cycle except the land-use change emissions.

The 2013, 2014, and 2015 Global Carbon Budget's methodology and database was published in the journal Earth System Science Data. It contains a detailed description of methodology developed by the global carbon cycle science community to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties and the rationale for the choices made. The paper also shows the changes in the budget compared to previous estimates, the consistency within and among components, and the methodological and data limitations. It is accompanied by a database with all the data and models used in the carbon budget.

This paper provides a baseline to keep track of the annual global carbon budget and to reduce their uncertainties. Each year since 2012, data and methodology has been updated and the most up to date information in relation to each component of the global carbon cycle will be included along with any improvements in our capacity to provide these estimates.

The 2014 carbon budget was accompanied by a Review Article in Nature Geoscience, a Perspective article and a Commentary in Nature Climate Change, and published during the New York Climate Summit in September 2014.

In the 2015 edition of the carbon budget we showed that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel and industry grew slightly (+0.6%) in 2014 and are projected to decline slightly (-0.6% (uncertainty ranges from -1.6 to +0.5%)) in 2015. These results mark a break with the rapid emissions growth of 2.4% per year of the previous decade (2004-2013). However it is not clear if this trend will continue in the future. We also discuss the primary reasons for this stall.

The 2015 carbon budget was accompanied by a Commentary in Nature Climate Change, and was published during the UNFCCC COP, Paris in December 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Global Carbon Budget dataset and its interpretation are extensively used outside the academic community, particularly to inform a variety of policy makers both in the UK and across the globe. It provides them with the most up to date information of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and trends in the carbon emissions and sinks, and also provides an analysis of the future trajectories and how they match different climate change projections. The Global Carbon Atlas (globalcarbonatlas.org) has been developed to improve the access to the data. The carbon cycle research community extensively uses our freely and easily accessible database made available with our annual publication, as evidenced by the large number of downloads in successive years, e.g. http://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/7/349/2015/essd-7-349-2015.html</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FFDF25D6-FED5-464A-BDDD-8F7A5870AE38</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.tyndall.ac.uk/communication/news-archive/2015/global-co2-emissions-projected-stall-2015</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of the Committee on Climate Change</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6EA710A6-32D2-4EEF-9406-1399FBA5E024</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Committee on Climate Change advises government on responses to climate change.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.theccc.org.uk/about/structure-and-governance/committee-on-climate-change/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UNFCCC Structured Expert Dialogue</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17FA69EE-4D6E-4E8B-BBF0-71C691B7034D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The contribution of Tyndall Centre and UEA researchers to the IPCC contributed to the signature of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

The global carbon budget refers to the mean, variations, and trends in the anthropogenic perturbation of CO2 in the atmosphere, referenced to the beginning of the industrial era. It quantifies the input of CO2 to the atmosphere by emissions from human activities, the growth of CO2 in the atmosphere, and the resulting changes in land and ocean carbon fluxes in response to increasing atmospheric CO2 levels, climate change and climate variability, and other anthropogenic and natural changes. An understanding of this perturbation budget over time and the underlying variability and trends of the natural carbon cycle are necessary to understand and quantify climate-carbon feedbacks.</gtr:description><gtr:id>91892624-F4CB-45FE-9027-95D6B745CEC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open access to all data from the Global Carbon Budget 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Global Carbon Budget 2015 Data (Excel Spreadsheet; doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP_2015)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://cdiac.ornl.gov/GCP/carbonbudget/2015/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4DC3E07F-649F-4CF6-B9C1-0EE6CE3732BB"><gtr:id>4DC3E07F-649F-4CF6-B9C1-0EE6CE3732BB</gtr:id><gtr:title>The challenge to keep global warming below 2 &amp;deg;C</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature Climate Change</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9ef59413de67ab77f5260e6b9b17744e"><gtr:id>9ef59413de67ab77f5260e6b9b17744e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Peters G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CF11094E-05D3-4B1E-B0ED-8CB6551927DE"><gtr:id>CF11094E-05D3-4B1E-B0ED-8CB6551927DE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The global carbon budget 1959-2011</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Earth System Science Data</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/462d707b88794ebabd94698d2a3a44c9"><gtr:id>462d707b88794ebabd94698d2a3a44c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Le Qu?r?
