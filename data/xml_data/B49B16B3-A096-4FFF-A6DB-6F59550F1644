But as yet, there has been little interest in the developmental role of indigenous philanthropists and charitable institutions in the developing world. Yet local charities and philanthropists are increasingly being recognised as making - and likely to make - significant contributions to development in the coming decades. As well as posing important questions regarding the nature and future of development and global capitalism, studies of indigenous philanthropy also intersect with classic problems in the anthropology of religion, the person, the economy, and the gift, amongst others. This panel invited ethnographically-informed papers that seek to understand the processes which give rise to indigenous forms of charity, of how the philanthropic impulse is manifest, and the role that indigenous philanthropy plays and can play in the development process.

Throughout the project we discussed our research plans and preliminary findings with a group of 12 local philanthropy and development stakeholders, representing foundations, companies, and donor agencies. This group, in various ways involved in philanthropic activities, had never had a chance to meet before in such a capacity, and as a result the meetings created opportunities for networking and collaboration. For example, a foundation and a company partnered together on an urban development project in Colombo as a direct consequence of the meetings.

Disseminating key findings through public events. 
At the start of the research we held a launch event in Colombo in May 2012, which was attended by more than 30 philanthropy and development stakeholders. As well as helping to highlight the importance of private development initiatives in the country, the event built interest in our project and by the end of fieldwork we capitalised on this by sharing key findings with a large group of interested individuals and organisations. More than 60 people attended our final public event in July 2013, at which we presented draft versions of three policy briefs highlighting trends, problems, and solutions in philanthropy and development in Sri Lanka. These were used by both Sri Lankan and other organisations as the basis for exploring potential linkages between charities and development organisations. They also led to companies rethinking their attitude towards corporate philanthropic activities towards more developmentally focused activities. 

Publication of policy briefs and dissemination at international level.

Once the fieldwork had been completed we visited the headquarters of major donor agencies to share our policy briefs. These included the World Bank, the European Union, and the Asian Development Bank. The ADB responded to our visit most enthusiastically, organising a seminar for staff in May 2014 at which we presented our findings and responded to a lively question and answer session around how to orientate philanthropy towards sustainable development goals. As a result of our visit, the ADB also decided to include Sri Lanka in a pan-Asia pilot project it was developing on collaborative projects with the private sector at national level.

Exploratory meetings between ADB and CSR Sri Lanka.
Another outcome of our visit to the ADB was that we organised and chaired videoconferences between ADB and CSR Lanka (CSRSL), Sri Lanka's new corporate social responsibility platform. The meetings explored the possibility of aligning the strategic priorities of ADB (in Sri Lanka) and CSRSL. This included the possibility of CSRSL members, which include the country's largest private companies, providing financial support to ADB activities, and/or working in collaboration with ADB projects. The initiative has since been taken over by CSRSL, which is continuing discussions with ADB on how these goals might be achieved.

Design and implementation of an ESRC-DfID Impact Maximisation award.

Finally, research results and the preceding impact activities fed directly into a follow-on project funded by an Impact Maximisation grant. Responding to calls from participants involved in our research and dissemination activities, we worked with CSRSL to provide 7 training sessions in philanthropy, CSR, and social business for more than 130 organisations in Colombo. This has led to various initiatives and colaborationscollaborations at the local level. We also supported a small pilot project in north-east Sri Lanka, . This involved a group of local companies, foundations, and donor agencies and showcased how philanthropic and charitable resources can be harnessed towards developmental goals.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CCF96081-01CA-47D0-AFD5-01941FF292EB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The primary objective of the research was to investigate how far indigenous forms of charity could be mobilised to support development. To do this we focused on charitable activities in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
What we found was that charitable and philanthropic activities are more a matter of individual predilections rather than any commitment to development per se. Most charity takes the form of social protection involving direct assistance to the poor and the marginal in terms of food, medical assistance and, to a lesser extent, housing. A range of charitable organisations support orphanages and old peoples' homes, supply medical services or provide support to education. 
Relatively few charitable and philanthropic activities are concerned with transformative interventions to attack the causes of social deprivation. Rather, existing forms of charity tend to reinforce economic and social inequalities. Organisations which have adopted a more transformative approach to development face increasing problems given the decline in foreign funding and the lack of local funding.
The motives underlying charity, coupled with the fragmented and disorganised nature of the charitable sector, limit the developmental potential of indigenous charities. However, in the corporate sector increasing awareness of the potential of CSR is opening up new possibilities for development-relevant interventions.
In sum, the conclusions of our research questioned the degree to which faith could be put in indigenous charity and philanthropy in supporting the sorts of development interventions which have traditionally been supported by bilateral and international donors, both official and unofficial.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In a follow-up grant (ES/L007819/1) we have sought to develop the findings of this project through providing training and developing training materials for philanthropic donors to develop more effective forms of giving. In addition we are in continuing discussions with various organisations, most significantly the Asian Development Bank, as to how our findings can be fed into developing policies for cooperation between development agencies and local charitable organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>09E8A52F-7A8C-496B-8702-42E074D5954C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social
