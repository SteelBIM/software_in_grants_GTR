Gerhard's work has as yet, not been documented due to his lack of institutional support, the difficulty in accessing his archive and the fact that this archive is not catalogued. In the archive at the Cambridge University Library are a large number of unpublished electronic works, electronic incidental music and sketches and rehearsal tapes for the Symphony no. 3 (Collages), one of the first major works following Varese's Desert to integrate orchestra and electronics. Now the University of Huddersfield has agreed a contract with the CUL to digitize and research the electronic music of Gerhard, this research project seeks to address a number of issues: what is the significance of Gerhard's electronic music on his own later instrumental music? what is Gerhard's influence on electronic music in the UK; how did Gerhard generate and structure his material? The research results will form the final three chapters of a book edited by the PI and Prof. Michael Russ. The remaining chapters are expanded versions of papers given at the 1st International Roberto Gerhard Conference which took place at the University of Huddersfield in May 2010. The PI and two RAs will also edit all of the electronic music for publication on CD by sub rosa.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Outside of the considerable academic impact this research will have a broader audience for this work can also be identified:\n\n1) The work will be of interest to all those interested in early electronic music. The recent success of CD publications of the early electronic music of Henri Pousseur by sub rosa and the music of Daphne Oram and Delia Derbyshire clearly demonstrate the wide non-academic market for this proposed research. Given the success of these previous releases we will be aiming towards a major article in The Wire to accompany the release of the CD. This has a distribution of over 10,000 readers worldwide.\n\n2) The book and CD will also be of interest to general enthusiasts of contemporary music. Again, the growth over the past decade of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival demonstrates the enthusiasm of non-professional musicians for contemporary music and especially electronic music. We will also be aiming to promote this work on BBC Radio 3. The CD will also be internationally distributed.\n\n3) Because of Gerhard's extensive connections with Spanish writers, painters and other cultural figures the book will also be of interest to those concerned with the development of Spanish culture post-Franco in the twentieth century.\n</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>146202</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>CD of electronic works</gtr:description><gtr:id>CDD48091-3CFB-453F-8306-48D2FE73AD2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Concerts of Gerhard's electronic music.

We imagine that the CD recording of works will have the most impact. However, this was only released in early October 2014 so its full impact has yet to be felt. Following reviews in the international press we anticipate that Gerhard's work and our research will gain even wider public exposure.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>FF2E9397-8168-4207-95D7-E36A584292A6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The electronic music of Roberto Gerhard was thought to be focused on works for radio and the 3rd Symphony. Our work clearly demonstrates that Gerhard's engagement with electronic music was far more substantial. In his tape archive the research team found a number of hitherto unheard works. These have been digitised and released commercially on CD. We have also documented our findings in the Roberto Gerhard Companion - a volume of essays published by Ashgate. Prof. Adkins co-edited the book with Prof. Michael Russ (University of Huddersfield). Three of the chapters were specifically about the electronic music and its influence on Gerhard's late instrumental style. http://www.ashgate.com/isbn/9781409445159 (book) http://www.subrosa.net/en/catalogue/early-electronic-music/roberto-gerhard.html (CD)</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There are a number of opportunities arising. Robert Worby (BBC Radio 3) is keen to take this research further and present a radio programme about Gerhard's work and his position in the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The original research team are continuing to research the archive with a view to making available performing versions of Gerhard's radio and theatre music with electronics. The release of the CD is important as it fills in another missing link in the early days of the history of British Electronic Music. This will be of importance to scholars, students and enthusiasts of electronic music.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C67634BF-1920-4972-8AF7-FC704FA4A543</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.robertogerhard.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/603C6E1C-F1EF-4BF5-922C-D60E35E24D7A"><gtr:id>603C6E1C-F1EF-4BF5-922C-D60E35E24D7A</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Roberto Gerhard Companion</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9acec619d3419327158a33bcd5156a1"><gtr:id>b9acec619d3419327158a33bcd5156a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>adkins, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978221224094224515229</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/I025395/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>0AEFDABE-67A4-48B1-9DB4-99393BDE6065</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Music</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>120E89AC-386D-4E25-9417-A3FE4D6FE83A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Musicology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
