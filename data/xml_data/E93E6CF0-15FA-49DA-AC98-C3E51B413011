Audio</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L019906/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Conventional surround sound systems such as 5.1 or 7.1 are limited in that they are only able to produce a two-dimensional (2D) impression of auditory width and depth. Next generation surround sound systems that have been introduced over recent years tend to employ height channel loudspeakers in order to provide the listener with the impression of a three-dimensional (3D) soundfield. Although new methods to position (pan) the sound image in the vertical plane have been investigated, there is currently a lack of research into methods to render the perceived vertical width of the image. The vertical width rendering is particularly important for creating the impression of a fully immersive 3D ambient sound in such applications as the production of original 3D music/broadcasting content and the 3D upmixing of 2D content. This project aims to provide fundamental understandings of the perception and control of vertically oriented image width for 3D multichannel audio. Three objectives have been formulated to achieve this aim: (i) to determine the frequency-dependent perceptual resolution of interchannel decorrelation for vertical image widening; (ii) to determine the effectiveness of 'Perceptual Band Allocation (PBA)', a novel method proposed for vertical image widening; (iii) to evaluate the above two methods in real-world 2D to 3D upmixing scenarios. These objectives will be achieved through relevant signal processing techniques and subjective listening tests focussing on perceived spatial and tonal qualities. Data obtained from the listening tests will be analysed using robust statistical methods in order to model the relationship between perceptual patterns and relevant parameters. The results of this project will provide researchers and engineers with academic references for the development of new 3D audio rendering algorithms, and will ultimately enable the general public to experience a fully immersive surround sound in the home-cinema, car and mobile environments.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research investigates methods to render stereophonic image width across vertically arranged loudspeakers, which will ultimately enable the creation of immersive 3D auditory sensation through sound reproduction utilising loudspeaker formats employing height channels. This project transfers signal decorrelation methods that have been widely used for horizontal stereo width rendering to a vertical dimension. Furthermore, it explores a novel vertical width rendering method named 'Perceptual Band Allocation' (PBA), which is optimised for vertical stereophony in terms of perceived tonal quality. The most immediate economic and societal impacts are expected through uptake of the investigated methods by the following four sectors: professional audio R&amp;amp;D; consumer audio R&amp;amp;D; music production/broadcasting; and electroacoustic music composition. The following sections describe how they will benefit from this project. Please see Pathway to Impact for related impact activities planned.

1) Impact on pro audio R&amp;amp;D

The results of this project will become the basis for pro audio companies to develop new sound mixing tools for 3D music production and broadcasting (e.g. 3D reverberator, 3D image widening tool, etc.). The extensive data sets produced from this project will determine the effectiveness of each investigated method in vertical width rendering for various experimental conditions (frequency band, loudspeaker position and sound source characteristics). Audio engineers will greatly benefit from this in terms of the effective design and efficient implementation of a new rendering algorithm; e.g. the data will be references as to which parameters to focus on depending on the target loudspeaker position or source type. Furthermore, since this project examines the tonal quality of rendered sound as well as the spatial quality for each experimental condition, the results of this research will help the engineers to ensure the overall sound quality of the implemented algorithm. 
 
2) Impact on consumer audio R&amp;amp;D

This project will benefit consumer Hi-Fi audio manufacturers. For example, the results of this project will be useful for the development of new 2D to 3D upmixing algorithms for home-cinema AV receivers. In combination with an existing source/ambience separation technique (e.g. Principal Component Analysis), the investigated methods can be applied to the ambient parts of original 2D signals to create the impression of environmental width in the height dimension. This will enable consumers to experience the impression of 3D Listener Envelopment from 2D-encoded contents in the home-cinema environment. Car audio companies will be another beneficiaries of this project. The experiments conducted in this project can be repeated in a similar manner for car audio systems. This will enable the design of new 3D upmixing algorithms which are optimised for specific loudspeaker arrangements in automobile cabins. Last but not least, the methods investigated in this project can also be combined with an existing binaural synthesis technique to develop a new 3D sound engine for mobile devices. 

3) Impact on music production and broadcasting

Sound engineers in music production and broadcasting will be important end-users of the audio mixing tools developed based on this project. Currently, there exists no software plug-ins to flexibly control the perceived vertical width of sound image in music mixing. This project will enable the sound engineers to fully utilise the added height dimension of 3D multichannel audio to create the impression of a fully immersive soundfield. 

4) Impact on electroacoustic music composition

The tools developed from this project will help electroacoustic music composers who exploit multichannel spatialisation techniques to express their musical ideas more creatively in 3D. This will ultimately impact the way music is presented to the audience in concerts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100076</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This audio recording has been made for Korean Chamber Orchestra's concert at Queens Elizabeth Hall in London in Feb 2015.

The perceptual mechanism of the so-called Pitch-Height effect for virtual auditory images has been revealed. Formal experimental data on the perceived vertical positions of octave-band filtered virtual images have been provided for different azimuth angles. It has been found that the nature of virtual source elevation localisation is significantly different from that of real source elevation localisation. 
2. It has been shown that the aforementioned vertical image position data can be successfully exploited for rendering different degrees of vertical image spread. This method has been tested for the 2D to 3D sound upmixing of ambient sound. The results showed that the method was subjectively preferred to other conventional methods. 
3. The association between the loudspeaker base angle and the perceived image elevation has been investigated in depth. It was generally shown that the perceived image is elevated from the front to above of the listener as the loudspeaker base angle increases from 0 degree to 180 degrees. It was newly found that the effect significantly depends on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the sound source. Sources with a broad and Specifically, frequency bands centred around 500Hz and 8kHz were found to have the strongest elevation effect. These findings have important implications for practical applications such as 3D sound rendering, upmixing and downmixing.
4. A novel theory that ultimately explains the reason for the virtual image elevation effect has been established. Whilst the conventional theory based on the psychophysics of pinnae spectral distortion is limited to explaining the effect for high frequencies, the proposed theory is based on the brain's cognitive interpretation of ear-input signals is able to explain the effect for low frequencies also.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. The PBA method can be used for developing 3D upmixing systems by audio software developers. The main application areas include home theatre audio-visual receiver (AVR), car audio, and virtual reality over headphones. 
2. The virtual image elevation method can be useful for 3D to 2D audio downmixing for home environment where height loudspeakers are not available. The upper-hemisphere amplitude panning (UHAP) method developed by exploiting the elevation principle can be used for 3D audio object panning without using height channels. This method can also be useful for binaural rendering for virtual reality applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8CCA58A1-A9F1-4462-9B4C-C92B273AA02F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.hud.ac.uk/research/researchcentres/mtprg/projects/apl/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Huddersfield 3D MRIR Database is a collection of multichannel room impulse responses captured using 48 different microphone configurations at St.Pauls concert hall in Huddersfield, UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A5BAF598-86D5-44F7-B849-048404C038D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I am currently in preparation of releasing the database to the public through a website.

However, the number scale method has a visual bias. The laser pointer method is more intuitive than the others but requires a motion tracking device and a careful calibration. In order to overcome such limitation, I developed a new method using an LED strip and a wheel controller, which are controlled using the Arduino microcontroller and Max7 software. This method allows the test subject to move a single LED position to the corresponding perceived image position using the wheel controller. The position data is collected and saved by the software to produce a text file. This method has been used for a vertical localisation test and was shown to be very efficient. The subjects found it very easy and intuitive to use the method compared to the number scale method. The consistency of subjects responses was found to be significantly better than the number scale method. The test time spent using the method is also dramatically shorter than that using the number scale method. Additionally, the method also allows the subject to overlay the multiple LED positions to different positions. This is useful when judging the left/right or lower/upper boundaries of the perceived image as well as perceived image position.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8E28BED-1F24-439D-8982-2B67AD3519A5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This method is expected to become a useful resource for spatial audio researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>LED controller for localisation test</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>IAR is a VST Plugin for 3D audio production.
