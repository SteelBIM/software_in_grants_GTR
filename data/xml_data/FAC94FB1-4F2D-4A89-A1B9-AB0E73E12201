The boom in low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet has made air travel more affordable and is stimulating leisure and increasingly, business demand. The research focus is on the general public and the choices they make when deciding whether to fly or not. For instance, if air fares rise by 20%, but the time taken to reach the airport falls by 10%, would an individual still choose to fly for a particular journey?The overall goal of the research is to assess the propensity, or likelihood, of individuals to fly. It concerns the development of stated choice models to assess the propensity to fly, and how this propensity varies across different segments of the population. Data for these modelling and segmentation tasks will largely come from a questionnaire survey of individual flying preferences. Data will be collected from over 1,000 residents of the East Midlands region, in which Nottingham East Midlands airport is located. Questions in the survey will concern socio-economic information, access to airports, flight history and attitudes towards air travel. In addition, a series of stated preference questions will be included, in which respondents will make hypothetical choices of whether to fly or not for specified leisure trips using low-cost airlines.The project will deliver a stated choice modelling capability and a greater understanding of air travel market segments. Such findings will be of benefit to aviation policy-makers, as they consider air travel demand forecasting and future airport capacity. Airlines and regional airports will also be beneficiaries, particularly those interested in the demand for air travel in the East Midlands region.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>126117</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>37267</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Success through people</gtr:description><gtr:end>2008-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/F012683/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>4FEC390B-F639-4A0F-A44C-98089AB692AF</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>A range of stakeholders were engaged throughout and after the project including airports (e.g. East Midlands airport), airlines (e.g. bmi baby), Government (e.g. Department for Transport) and other bodies (e.g. Sustainable Development Commission, East Midlands Tourism).

The boom in low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and easyJet made air travel more affordable and is stimulating leisure and increasingly, business demand. Recent economic pressures and on-going environmental concerns are influencing air travel attitudes and behaviour. 



The Propensity to Fly research focus was on the general public and the choices they make when conducting air travel. The overall goal of the research was to assess the propensity, or likelihood, of individuals to fly. It concerned the development of stated choice models to assess the propensity to fly, and how this propensity varies across different segments of the population. The initial stage of the project included a literature review, media analysis, focus groups (supplemented by aviation tax focus groups for the Sustainable Development Commission), and examination of secondary data (including purchased CAA data for the East Midlands region). Insights include the impacts of life stage (such as having children and retirement) upon air travel, and an overall individual preference for greener aviation solutions through technology improvements rather than restricting air travel behaviour. 



The main data collection phase was a series of questionnaire-based East Midlands Air Travel Surveys (EMATS), of over 1,400 households. EMATS1 included innovative stated choice experiments for flight and airport decision-making; EMATS2 involved a survey panel to examine repeat choice decisions and the examination of the decision whether to fly or not; EMATS3 had a particular focus on the environmental aspects of air travel choices (including a flight energy rating) and associated attitudes (linking with the Theory of Planned Behaviour). 



The project delivered a stated choice modelling capability, highlighting the willingness of individuals to make both airline and airport trade-offs. In addition to air fare, the important of departure time and airport parking cost when making air travel decisions has been highlighted. Segmentation, using cluster analysis, identified 8 distinct population segments (e.g. &amp;quot;less mobile, low earners&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;retiring frequent flyers&amp;quot;). Only a small proportion of respondents were trying to fly less for environmental reasons; it would take a ?50 increase in total air fare for most individuals to reduce their air travel.



The research team (Dr Ryley &amp;amp; Dr Davison) used the same travel behaviour methodology (segmentation &amp;amp; choice modelling) as part of two further EPSRC projects (FUTURENET, ABC project). Propensity to Fly was boosted by the ESPRC INDICATOR project in 2007/2008, which enabled further training, international collaborations and dissemination in both air travel and operational research.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A range of stakeholders was engaged throughout the project including airports (e.g. East Midlands airport), airlines (e.g. bmi baby), Government (e.g. Department for Transport) and other bodies (e.g. Sustainable Development Commission, East Midlands Tourism). This was achieved through seminars, stakeholder visits and a project newsletter, and is continuing through subsequent research projects by the research team. The project delivered a stated choice modelling capability and a greater understanding of air travel market segments. Potential exploitation includes taking the findings to national policy-makers, airports, airlines and other relevant bodies (i.e. Civil Aviation Authority, International Air Transport Association).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EB5C4F45-4BFD-4759-A046-B405B30DFB0E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E26B90D7-884F-4D85-99CF-019A17CC0A9C"><gtr:id>E26B90D7-884F-4D85-99CF-019A17CC0A9C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Regional airports in a competitive market: a case study of Cardiff International Airport</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Airport Management [paper accepted]</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/ec054938dad8cab6b793713be9c2eeff"><gtr:id>ec054938dad8cab6b793713be9c2eeff</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>L Davison</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F4FABABA-CC13-4927-9C43-321AC5F8B14C"><gtr:id>F4FABABA-CC13-4927-9C43-321AC5F8B14C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Tourism destination preferences of low-cost airline users in the East Midlands</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Transport Geography</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2303b29ea2cfbdaa373b7c9edfe4e9ad"><gtr:id>2303b29ea2cfbdaa373b7c9edfe4e9ad</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Davison L</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E5A41EAD-7164-44D3-B8A2-E75BBE210672"><gtr:id>E5A41EAD-7164-44D3-B8A2-E75BBE210672</gtr:id><gtr:title>UK air travel preferences: Evidence from an East Midlands household survey</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Air Transport Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5c6a7dc7b5ff268d12fad9fd805aafd1"><gtr:id>5c6a7dc7b5ff268d12fad9fd805aafd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Ryley T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/76C9645F-9E2E-45B2-AB03-FB122FB41C12"><gtr:id>76C9645F-9E2E-45B2-AB03-FB122FB41C12</gtr:id><gtr:title>Valuing air transportation and sustainability from a public perspective: Evidence from the United Kingdom and the United States</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Research in Transportation Business &amp;
