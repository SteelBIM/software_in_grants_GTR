However, any assessment of these expected health gains and costs will be uncertain, particularly if the technology is new and has not been widely used in the NHS. In these circumstances further research would be able to confirm whether or not the technology is worthwhile, leading to better decisions for future patients. There will be circumstances in which this research can be conducted while the technology is in wide spread use but in others the type of research which is needed may only be possible before the technology is approved and made available. This research intends to establish the principles of what assessments need to be made to guide the decisions about whether a technology should only be approved for use in research or when approval can be granted while additional evidence is gathered. It will also examine how these assessments should be made. For example they could be made based on a set of criteria applied to the type of information and analysis currently considered by NICE in their appraisal process or could be based on additional information and analysis that could be conducted and made available. This research will include an examination of past decisions made by NICE as well as a series of more detailed case studies. The results of this research will be presented at a series of workshop which will include representative of those who have an interest in and responsibility for different aspects of the appraisal of health technologies. These workshops will make recommendations about what assessments are needed and how they should be made.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The general issue of balancing the value of evidence about the performance of a technology and the value of access to a technology can be seen as central to a number of policy questions. Establishing the key principles of what assessments are needed, as well as how they should be made, will enable them to be addressed in an explicit and transparent manner. The aims of this research are to: i) Establish the key principles of what assessments are needed to inform an only in research (OIR) or Approval with Evidence Development (AED) recommendation. ii) Evaluate previous NICE guidance where OIR or AED recommendations were made or considered. iii) Establish what impact OIR and AED decisions may have had on subsequent research. iv) Evaluate a range of alternative options to establish the criteria, additional information and/or analysis which could be made available to help the assessment needed to inform an OIR or AED recommendation. v) Provide a series of final recommendations, with the involvement of key stakeholders, establishing both the key principles and associated criteria that might guide OIR and AED recommendations, identifying what, if any, additional information or analysis might be included in the Technology Appraisal process and how such recommendations might be more likely to be implemented through publically funded and sponsored research. To meet these aims the research is broadly structured as follows: i) development of a coherent conceptual framework to establish the key principles of what assessments need to be made and identify a set of explicit criteria (checklist of assessments) which could be applied; ii) review previous NICE guidance and develop a series of detailed case studies to evaluate a range of options for informing these assessments; iii) evaluate both the development of key principles and the range of options for informing assessments through a series of workshops involving a wide range of key stakeholders.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>186556</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NICE Only in Research (second) Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>D10132E1-46CA-4D66-933F-4A000C7CE802</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The relevance of this work to NICE was evaluated through a series of two workshops which involved key stakeholders. This 2nd workshop included 50 participants from a range for stakeholder groups. It considered: i) Whether the revised algorithm of assessments and the associated check list has identified the key judgements that need to be made when considering OIR and AWR guidance. ii) Based on the application of this check list to the series of case studies, can such assessments be made based on existing information and analysis provided to NICE and in what circumstances could additional information and/or analysis be useful? iii) What implications this more explicit assessment of OIR and AWR might have for policy (e.g. NICE guidance and drug pricing), the process of appraisal (e.g. greater involvement of research commissioners) and methods of appraisal (e.g. should additional information, evidence and analysis be required).

It is expected that the out but of this and first workshop will inform the review of NICE methods of appraisal which will take place in 2011. The second workshop took place on 13th June 2011. The briefing documents and summary of feedback from the workshop are published on the web. The HTA monograph was submitted in August 2011 and a CHE Research Report was published in September 2011. The HTA monograph is under revision and expected to be published in early 2013.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2011</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>NICE Only in Research Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:id>1B5C267C-A7B7-4421-8118-4021CF803B11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The relevance of this work to NICE is evaluated through a series of two workshops which will involve key stakeholders. This first workshop included 50 participants from a range for stakholder groups. It considered: i) the relevance to NICE of existing literature; ii) the insights from a detailed review of previous NICE guidance and iii) whether the conceptual framework and the key principles and assessment that follows from it is a suitable basis for informing NICE guidance. The primary output of this workshop was a set of principles and explicit criteria (a sequence of assessment and decisions) to support only in research (OIR) and approval with evidence development (AED) recommendations. The workshop also considered the range of options for informing these assessment through additional information, evidence and analysis which could be part of the Technology Appraisal process.

It is expected that the out but of this and the next workshop will inform the review of NICE methods of appraisal which will take place in 2011. The brefing documents and sumary of feedbakc from the workshop will be published on the web on 2nd December.
