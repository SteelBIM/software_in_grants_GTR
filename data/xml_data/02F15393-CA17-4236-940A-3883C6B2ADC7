Since the award of these centres there have been a number of collaborative activities between Centres, as well as a series of meetings for Centre Directors and Managers, that have enabled sharing of best practice, consolidation of resources and contributed to the excellence and impact of the work done within the CDTs in Digital Economy.

The proposed network will formalise collaborative activities to be conducted by current CDTs and those that will be funded under the DE priority area within the 2013 CDT call. In addition, the establishment of this network offers the opportunity to open some of the collaborative initiatives to those involved in PhD study and supervision from across the DE programme, encompassing work done in DE hubs and individual DE-related projects. 

The Network will provide resource to support rapid response to this changing landscape, and enable DE Postgraduate Research (PGR) students to work with each other and engage with external activities. The Network will consolidate and expand the network of DE PGR students, ensuring that a collegiate and engaged group of post docs lead DE activities in industry and academia in the future. CDTs remain a relatively new concept within UK postgraduate education, and conducting research in the multidisciplinary space of digital economy presents particular novel challenges that particularly benefit from collaboration between colleagues and students. 

Activities within the network will be coordinated under five themes: 1. Sharing Best Practice; 2. Large Scale Shared Events; 3. Sustainable Impact; 4. New Collaborative Initiatives; 5. Community Outreach and Dissemination. The Network will enable activities that would not have been possible to run by individual Centres for Doctoral Training or Hubs alone, and which take particular advantage of the links between Digital Economy related activities at different institutions. Events will comprise both activities that have already been identified as of value to DE doctoral students, such as the summer school, hackfests or Digital Economy Young Entrepreneurs Scheme, and those which are proposed by members of the DE research community and supported by the network. Funding will support a Network Administrator to help run and plan events and manage bids to the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Commercial private sector beneficiaries will include many businesses who will engage with PhD students during their research and employ DE PhD students once they have completed their PhDs. Specific mechanisms for engaging the commercial private sector include participation in the Digital Economy Young Entrepreneurs Schemes, sponsorship of individual events, speaking at events such as the DE summer schools and providing case examples for events such as the proposed Hackfests. 

The wider public will benefit as they engage with DE research through public engagement activities such as Digital Shoreditch or individually led events by small groups of PhD students. It is hoped that the events will engage the public in a variety of ways including dedicated outreach face to face events and production of high quality digital interactive material that will enable the public to engage with and increase their understanding of DE research. It is also hoped that events will be in a range of national (and possibly international) locations to disseminate research and that they will access a range of user groups, including school children.

Public sector beneficiaries will primarily consist of organisations with pursuit of new knowledge or research as a core activity (e.g. libraries), museums and galleries. and government bodies. These beneficiaries will be on a national and regional level. They will be able to easily access case studies of research and activities that will increase their abilities to engage with Centres for Doctoral Training and individual PhD researchers within the topics of Digital Economy. 

Overall, the aim of the network is to support PhD students within the DE research area and thus have a positive impact on their research quality. DE research in general has a core focus on the impact of technologies and systems on society, communities and industry, and thus the network has will contribute to work done in all of these areas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>507359</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Transport Systems Catapult</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Transport Systems Catapult</gtr:description><gtr:id>585CCF93-BE4F-4AB1-BA3D-6051EA2534A4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None at present - hoping to host a hack event using TSC modelling data at the TSC in 2015</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Hosted the September 2014 Digital Economy Network Meeting at their facilities in Milton Keynes.

A cross-CDT residential PhD Writing Retreat was held for 23 CDT students on 15-16 February 2016 at Wyresdale Park, Scorton, Lancashire, which was organised by DEN in conjunction with the HighWire CDT and Lancaster University Management School. Dr Casey Wilson, Teaching Fellow at LUMS led and facilitated the retreat. The feedback from students who attended was extremely positive and students stated that they had completed the writing of journal papers within the retreat and also planned for a potential DE Summer School Peer Journal Review Workshop, due to having dedicated time to focus on this.
Publications and other outputs achieved from this event will be captured and reported in the next Researchfish reporting period.

Futures of the End of Life was an international 2-day symposium held at Lancaster House Hotel, Lancaster on 21-22 January 2016, which attracted international speakers and 33 delegates.
A Special Edition publication is now planned by the event organising committee to publish the outcomes of this event to a wider audience.
Talks and workshops at the event were streamed live via Periscope to enable reach to a wider remote audience internationally.
The event also had its own Twitter account @FuturesEoL so that live tweeting could take place from the event, which also extended the reach, awareness and potential impact of the event, using specific #digital death and #futuresEOL hashtags.
Following on from this event, a journal article based on a presentation delivered at this symposium has been accepted and will be published in the international Social Analysis Journal entitled 'Dearly Departed: Communicating with the Dead in the Digital Age', No 3, Volume 61, 2017.

This one-day meeting allowed cross-CDT best practice sharing, networking and to collaborately plan for future workshops, seminars and events to benefit the CDT students within the network.
Presentations delivered by the DEN Director, EPSRC Digital Economy Theme and Digital Civics CDT Summer School 2016 organisers were also shared around the Network mailing lists for those who were unable to attend on the day.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.den.ac.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Exploring Common Values - Diviling Deeply into the Digital Frontier - Ten go to Tiree (Oct 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DF6D0E8B-68A7-48FB-8AAC-4F0C2C767618</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10 current CDT/PhD students from across 4 EPSRC-funded Centres for Doctoral Training (HighWire, Horizon My Life in Data, Web Science and Digital Civics) participated in a research field trip on the remote island of Tiree in Scotland from 8-13 October 2016. The title of the activity was 'Exploring common values: Diving deeply into the Digital Frontier.' The activities included a data walk and there were also direct interactions with the habitants of Tiree during the research activity.
The 10 CDT students also participated in the 2016 Tiree Techwave, an annual hands-on making and meeting event which explores the edges of technology on the wild edge of Scotland.
Louise Mullagh, HighWire CDT Student, Lancaster University - provided a presentation to disseminate the activity, findings and proposed future outputs to the DEN research community at the DEN Annual Meeting on 1 February in London.
