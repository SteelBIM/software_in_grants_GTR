This project aims to overcome gaps in conceptual and empirical knowledge about this topic, with particular emphasis on the problems facing older people living in urban settings. This goal should be seen in the context of pressures arising from population ageing and urbanisation. By 2030, two-thirds of the world's population will reside in cities, with - for urban areas in high income countries - at least one-quarter of their populations aged 60 and over. The World Health Organization's 'Age-Friendly Cities' project (2007) emphasises the theme of developing supportive urban environments for older citizens. Policies directed at this goal are seen to require interventions targeted at both the social and physical environment. Following this, the WHO (2010) established the Global Network of Age-friendly Cities and Communities (AFCC) to encourage implementation of policy recommendations arising from the project. By January 2015, this Network spanned 26 countries worldwide with 210 cities and communities enrolled in the programme. The AFCC model has been influential in raising awareness about the need to adapt urban environments to the demands of an ageing population. However, research is needed that examines whether and how this model contributes to tackling social exclusion among older people across different urban settings.

This research project examines this last issue by using an original research design drawing on both quantitative and qualitative methods. It takes a cross-national approach that will identify new policies and practices for challenging social exclusion in European cities. The research is divided into three strands. Strand 1 involves an analysis of the current literature and existing data sets in Ireland, the UK and Belgium. This will provide new insights into how social exclusion varies for diverse groups of older Europeans (e.g. different cohorts, migrants, oldest-old) living in urban settings in contrasting EU nations. The findings from Strand 1 provide the background for Strand 2, which focuses on three cities: Dublin, Manchester and Brussels. These were among the first to be admitted into the WHO Network of AFCC. The question of how these 'Age-Friendly' cities have responded to the issues faced by those experiencing social exclusion (as identified in Strand 1) will be explored through a review of relevant social policy documents in the respective cities, and qualitative research through expert interviews with citywide stakeholders. Strand 3 examines projects designed to challenge social exclusion, with a particular focus on those that illustrate 'good practice'. The methodology for this strand will be based on a model of participatory research, involving the training of older people to become co-researchers in the selected projects. 

In exploring these strands, the research will break new ground, both in the development of a conceptual framework for understanding social exclusion in old age in urban settings, and in providing the knowledge necessary for addressing a priority area in social policy. The project will engage with a range of academic audiences and research user groups (e.g. policy-makers, civil society organizations, older people) in order to maximise impact, and will engage with internationally renowned experts and institutions to ensure wide dissemination of the research. Consequently, this project will produce and disseminate a rich evidence base which will enhance knowledge about how to tackle social exclusion across different audiences. Alongside academic papers and presentations in international journals and conferences, dissemination channels will include stakeholder meetings, a policy roadmap for future action and development, and a good practice toolkit providing guidance on reducing social exclusion.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project has significance for a wide range of research users. An Impact Working Group (IWG) will be formed comprised of expert stakeholders who will support the project's dissemination strategy and enhance channels of communication with decision makers. Representatives of the following organisations have agreed to be part of the IWG: the WHO Department of Ageing and Life Course; the three cities' Age-Friendly programmes; AGE Platform Europe and Age UK. The IWG's involvement from the start of the project is to ensure that key research user interests are built into the research design. 

The detailed plan for impact can be found in the Pathways to Impact document. It involves a strong beneficiary involvement throughout the project and a concrete dissemination plan, including 'open seminars' and a final dissemination event, supported by organisations (the Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing [MICRA], Age UK, Manchester City Council) linked with the research; a project website and blog; a policy report; and a good practice toolkit. Should this project be funded, MICRA, an ageing research network of over 1,500 academics, practitioners, policy makers and older people, has offered substantial support (&amp;pound;10K) to the implementation of the impact activities (see letter of support). 

The project will be of particular benefit to:
a) Political actors, policy stakeholders and think tanks who are keen to improve their understanding of the ways in which policies can be strengthened to improve older people's quality of life. These include: the WHO Dept. of Ageing and Life Course; the European Commission's DG for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion; the International Longevity Centre-UK; and Government Departments such as Work and Pensions and Communities and Local Government. These beneficiaries will be actively involved in supporting and identifying impact pathways from the project towards key long-term policy change, and will benefit from the roadmapfor future action and development.
b) Local authorities within the three case study cities: The research directly feeds into their Age-Friendly Programmes and will provide an evidence-base for the strategic commissioning of services that have an impact on older people's quality of life. Leaders of the Age-Friendly Programmes will also participate in the project's IWG.
c) Third-sector stakeholders with a specific remit to create inclusive communities where older people feel secure, valued and able to contribute to society. These include: AGE Platform Europe, Age UK, Age Action Alliance and Beth Johnson Foundation. These beneficiaries will be actively involved in the implementation and dissemination of the project outputs, with the research directly feeding into their policy work, campaigns, expert briefings and media activities. 
d) Practitioner-oriented networks, such as the network on Innovation for Age-Friendly Environments and the UK Urban Ageing Consortium, who will especially benefit from the good practice toolkit on tackling social exclusion.
e) Networks bringing together academics, policy-makers and third-sector stakeholders with a focus on ageing issues and urbanisation: Collaborative dissemination activities will be undertaken with the International Network on Population Ageing and Urbanisation, MICRA and Cities@Manchester who have formally agreed to support this project. 
f) Older people themselves who may be especially keen to understand the risk factors associated with exclusion in old age (Strand 1); how these can be prevented and addressed (Strand 2), as well as how to voice their concerns or play a role in (research) projects focusing on exclusion (Strand 3). Older people will be actively involved in all stages of the project, through 'open seminars' aimed at bridging the gap between academic research and the general public, alongside opportunities to participate in training sessions and become involved as co-researchers in the project.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224158</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Translating Research into Practice: A public engagement activity with the local community at the annual Celebrate Festival, a neighbourhood event in Manley Park,  Whalley Range, Manchester on July the 16th.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB7E2F35-8CB6-4435-A168-45368C6B36E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Translating Research into Action project aimed to work with an existing group of older co-researchers to examine the age-friendliness of their
neighbourhood, and to translate research fi?ndings into practice and policy recommendations that can help improve the quality of life of older people in urban neighbourhoods. At the annual Celebrate Festival, a neighbourhood event in Manley Park, Whalley Range in Manchester on July the 16th, co-researchers and team members presented research findings and engaged with the community. A local artist was engaged to create an 'Opinion Tree'. Community members were invited to 'leaf their opinion' on the tree with their suggestions for change. Also in the Age-Friendly Marquee were
refreshments, information from local groups, and a craft table.
The aims of disseminating the fi?ndings at the Celebrate Festival were to: 1. Raise awareness of the age-friendly research .2. Engage community members in the research by seeking feedback on the identified social and environmental issues for older people living in the area. .3. Encourage community members to make their own suggestions for change.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Policy conference contribution: International Conference on Ageing (IFA) 13th Global Conference on Ageing, Brisbane, Australia (Symposium convener and presentation)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>88289A57-0774-4CE2-8A06-BA567FB0DCE4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Symposium: Critical perspectives on age-friendly communities: An emerging evidence base

Research on age-friendly cities should be integrated with research on changes affecting urban environments

? Economic austerity has restricted the development of age-friendly programmes

? Urban regeneration and gentrification create problems for older people 'ageing in place'

? The challenge is creating an urban environment that supports the autonomy and equal rights of older people with others to a 'share' of urban space</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is a strong case for incorporating issues about ageing in urban environments with debates concerning spatial justice

Understanding optimum environments for ageing must be seen as an inter-disciplinary enterprise requiring understanding of the impact of developments such as the changing dynamics of urban poverty on older people, the consequences of urban renewal and regeneration, and the impact of transnational migration 

There remains a need for experimentation to test and learn from participatory and collaborative approaches involving older people in the co-production of urban space

There is a need for a global perspective (including cross-national comparative perspectives) on developing Age-friendly cities and communities, with a particular focus on issues around social exclusion</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A20DF2C5-D33A-446A-A18C-0B3238837C8A</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/04B2BC04-3430-442B-82D5-A6B01AF0552C"><gtr:id>04B2BC04-3430-442B-82D5-A6B01AF0552C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing age-friendly cities and communities: A global perspective (in press)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab"><gtr:id>82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buffel T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/05AD7E5D-C1C6-480B-92F3-DA197BF6DEFB"><gtr:id>05AD7E5D-C1C6-480B-92F3-DA197BF6DEFB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing age-friendly cities and communities: A global perspective (in press)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab"><gtr:id>82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buffel T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D874488F-8569-4C6A-8956-B376AAD3F794"><gtr:id>D874488F-8569-4C6A-8956-B376AAD3F794</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing age-friendly cities and communities: A global perspective (in press)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab"><gtr:id>82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buffel T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7E9FF878-85BF-40F0-AC1F-C4282371E515"><gtr:id>7E9FF878-85BF-40F0-AC1F-C4282371E515</gtr:id><gtr:title>Involving older residents in age-friendly developments: from information to co-production mechanisms (in press)</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Housing for the Elderly</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a63cde1a625be0f0f11dd72c7217a0f4"><gtr:id>a63cde1a625be0f0f11dd72c7217a0f4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Remillard-Boilard S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F1D5E52E-C0A7-4720-88EA-FA9B5AEE1CDC"><gtr:id>F1D5E52E-C0A7-4720-88EA-FA9B5AEE1CDC</gtr:id><gtr:title>Developing age-friendly cities and communities: A global perspective (in press)</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab"><gtr:id>82d65f07a39c484066dfc850f140e0ab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buffel T</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4137DD16-B0B6-4AFF-B037-001BB6399A4E"><gtr:id>4137DD16-B0B6-4AFF-B037-001BB6399A4E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Geographical Gerontology: Concepts and Approaches</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0fee43637b9155127b1d268d808c2b1"><gtr:id>a0fee43637b9155127b1d268d808c2b1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buffel, T.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BF217519-DC82-4F8D-8610-3E9177A3EC7F"><gtr:id>BF217519-DC82-4F8D-8610-3E9177A3EC7F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Re-thinking home.
