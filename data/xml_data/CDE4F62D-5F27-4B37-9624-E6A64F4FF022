infrastructure</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/M008517/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Safety performance of the UK railways has improved significantly in recent decades, though over the same period costs have also increased, resulting in an efficiency gap between current industry costs and comparable railways elsewhere in Europe (McNulty 2011). This gap can be partly attributed to the use of overly conservative safety standards, with the potential to be replaced by calculated risk controls accompanied by appropriate risk modelling and assessment. By identifying low risk locations or routes and areas where the risk controls deliver little or no additional safety benefit, the industry could achieve significant cost and efficiency savings through the removal of unnecessary/over-prescriptive control measures (Griffin &amp;amp; Holloway 2012).

The proposed research will deliver a model and toolkit to improve prediction of risk to rail infrastructure using environmental information, including weather conditions in real time or, historically, according to user specified scenarios. This adds several new dimensions to RSSB's Safety Risk Model (SRM) and thus provides significant potential to improve risk calculations and controls and provide cost efficiencies for managing the safety of the UK rail infrastructure.
 
The proposed research identifies clear potential advantages to the RSSB stakeholder, who stand to benefit from a much improved Safety Risk Model, taking environmental factors into account. Such benefits would be shared with other rail industry stakeholders, including Network Rail, Department of Transport and other researchers, all informing government rail safety policy, investment and spending decisions.

If successful, the developed tool has the potential to be &amp;quot;disruptive&amp;quot;, changing &amp;quot;business as usual&amp;quot; practices at the RSSB stakeholder and related rail infrastructure organisations. The tool can provide the introduction of real-time environmental safety risk modelling which has not previously been available in the UK, or reported to be in place elsewhere.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>44570</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>British Geological Survey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>GeoSRM Academic, Research and Innovation partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>39EA8016-609E-484F-850E-72C3D9AED490</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration played a major part in achieving the deliverables to the GeoSRM environmental risk project, including a research basis for the models and concepts employed.

This will yield substantial feedback and provide a roadmap for future development.

There is potential positive impact for the travelling public. Landslips can cause closure of some routes which, depending on the location can mean isolation of some populations, eg when sea washed away track at Dawlish the route was closed for two months, the Cleethorpes-Doncaster route was closed for 11 weeks because of subsidence.

Initial metric-based estimation of potential safety benefits have been derived from the GB Rail industry's Safety Risk Model. Other than quantitative safety benefits, there are other potential positive impacts, eg performance (reduction in delay minutes, cancellations of services), reduction in knock-on damage to other infrastructure assets, eg track, track bed, signalling etc., greater efficiency in resource allocation/siting.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C39B87B1-6AD4-421D-BE4A-65097D88AE1D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project began with a review of relevant existing research, including meetings with a number of rail industry stakeholders and academic partners and projects. A survey was undertaken of potential environmental data, assessing usefulness, accessibility, spatial/temporal resolution and extent, as well as problems and limitations presented by their insufficiency.

The environmental component of rail risk is a combination of a range of factors and their interaction in time and space. Current research agrees that soil type, soil moisture deficit and rainfall intensity are key environmental variables affecting rail safety, particularly in relation to derailment. This data is readily available to researchers at sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution for the UK, providing the potential to test this research.

The development component of the project set out to integrate high resolution precipitation data, long-term climatic averages and soil parent material data, with location data for tracks, assets (hard and soft structures including embankments, cuttings, retaining walls, culverts, bridges, crossings, viaducts and tunnels) and incidents. This could be tested for the whole of the UK, while within the Wessex route (the existing safety risk model pilot) there was the additional availability of modelled derailment risk, which could be combined with the environmental data to deliver improved on-the-fly risk calculations of derailment risk for the region, with potential for future nationwide extension. 

The concept and methodology was developed into a specification for an extensible architecture and toolkit, which could be demonstrated to and validated by key researchers and stakeholders. The prototype application presents a user-controlled toolkit that obtains 5-minute precipitation grids (NIMROD), computes 5-day cumulative precipitation of every 5x5 km area within the UK, then computes rainfall exceedance or shortfall in relation to monthly long-time averages (UKCP09). This result is then combined with soil clay content (British Geological Survey) and ultimately yields a risk coefficient overlaid with the rail network or combined with rail risk model data. 

The prototype was presented to a number of industry and academic stakeholders, identifying areas for potential development, possibly in partnership with industry.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research basis and data were developed into a methodology, extensible architecture and a prototype toolkit that could be further developed and scaled up in a number of ways for wide application in the rail industry. 

The research outcomes have identified clear potential benefits to Network Rail, RSSB and other industry stakeholders, all concerned with making the rail network resilient to environmental risk and targeting investment (and preventive measures) effectively for efficient management of infrastructure. 

Benefits could be realised further by applying the same concept outside of the UK, depending on availability of environmental data. Potential has also been identified for using the same tools and techniques for roads and initial discussions had with safety risk modellers within the Highways England.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>AF2D0235-F19F-46C6-823B-5D76D1B2E96B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.geodata.soton.ac.uk/geodata/web/project214</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>An extensible geospatial architecture and live database for retrieving, transforming, combining and delivering a range of environmental data sources related to rail risk, including:
