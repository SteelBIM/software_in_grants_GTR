depression</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G0502003</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The proposed research aims to assess the possible value of a novel approach to self-help treatments for depression. This new approach involves individuals repeatedly practising tasks specially designed to directly change aspects of thinking known to maintain depression. Previous studies have demonstrated that this approach, called cognitive training, has beneficial effects, at least over the short-term. Thus, a single session of cognitive training lasting 30 minutes reduces how upset individuals get in response to a subsequent upsetting event, whilst cognitive training repeated daily for a week reduces depressive symptoms in people with mild to moderate levels of depression. Thus, the key question of the proposed research is whether these positive effects of cognitive training remain when tested over a longer-time scale and on people with more severe depression. To answer this question, separate experiments will compare the effects on symptoms of depression of cognitive training repeated daily for between 1-8 weeks against no training in (a) people with mild to moderate levels of depressive symptoms, and (b) people diagnosed with clinical depression. It is hoped that by directly targeting thinking known to maintain depression, cognitive training will be an effective and powerful treatment for depression. The wider relevance of testing cognitive training is that it could easily be developed into a self-help treatment for depression, with people either practising it on their own or with brief guidance from a health care worker. Despite having effective treatments for depression, such as antidepressant medication and cognitive behaviour therapy, the majority of people with depression in the UK do not receive adequate treatment. Indeed, the main complaint of mental health consumers is the lack of access to psychological help. The development of effective self-help treatments has therefore been recommended as one way to ensure that good psychological help is available and accessible to as large a number of patients with depression as possible. Thus, this approach has the potential to become an effective, low-cost, widely available intervention for depression that is accessible for the large numbers of patients within the NHS who do not receive specialist treatment for depression, and, as such, could significantly reduce the distress, suffering, mortality, disability and financial burden produced by depression. This research will be communicated to the general public by the development of a widely available self-help package and by reports on our findings through our website and the national media.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project is a Phase I and II study to prepare an innovative ?cognitive training? approach to self-help interventions for depression. Cognitive training involves repeated practice on cognitive tasks in order to directly modify cognitive processes involved in the onset and maintenance of psychological disorders. A key process implicated in the maintenance of depression is rumination about symptoms and problems. Experimental research by the applicant suggests that the thinking style during rumination determines whether it is detrimental or beneficial, with an abstract style unhelpful and a concrete style helpful. In preclinical studies, the applicant found that single session training into the concrete style reduced rumination and negative mood in response to a subsequent mild failure, compared to training into the abstract style. Further pilot work found that repeating this concrete cognitive training daily over a week significantly reduced depressive symptoms in dysphoric participants, suggesting this approach as a possible therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the current research objectives are to test ?proof of concept? for: (a) cognitive training as a potential therapeutic intervention, by determining whether repeated cognitive training into the concrete style produces robust and stable changes in thinking style and depression that generalize to clinical depression; (b) thinking style as a mechanism that causally mediates the effects of training on depression. The study consists of psychological experiments using between-subject manipulation designs in which participants are randomly allocated to concrete cognitive training conditions or to no-training control conditions. Changes in thinking style (assessed on cognitive-experimental measures), rumination and depressed symptoms (assessed on HRSD and BDI) will be assessed from pre-condition to post-condition. Experiments 1 and 2 explore the effects of cognitive training repeated daily over 1 week in dysphoric participants (BDI 14) to determine the most effective means of training. A single case series closely monitors the longer-term stability and effects of training repeated every day across 8 weeks in depressed patients. Experiment 3 pilots the efficacy, stability over 3-month follow-up, and robustness of cognitive training repeated daily over 4-8 weeks relative to control conditions in currently depressed patients. The results will be used (a) as an essential first step in determining the viability of cognitive training as a potential self-help intervention, (b) providing data for power calculations and protocols to prepare applications for a full-scale randomized controlled trial. If efficacious in a future Phase III trial, cognitive training could be rapidly exploited into a widely available self-help package for depression.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>464048</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Amsterdam</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Prevention of Rumination and Worry in Adolescents - Netherlands</gtr:description><gtr:id>F706B174-6BBE-4666-A92B-0D0F431C56BF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research started in 2009- the most notable outcome to date of this collaboration is the award of funding to the project - with my collaborators as Principal Investigators and with me as co-PI, we have been awarded a ZonMW (Dutch based funding organisation) grant titled &amp;quot;Preventing depression and anxiety disorders by targeting excessive worry and rumination in healthy adolescents&amp;quot;. Grant value: 265,500 Euros. Period of award: November 2009 - November 2013. PI- Dr Thomas Ehring (University of Amsterdam) -Prof Watkins, co-PI. 

We recruited over 250 adolescents and young adults into the trial and provided them with interventions and are now following up to determine the longer term impact of this intervention. The outcomes of the trial were positive showing that the active interventions reduced incidence of depression and anxiety by 50%. The outcomes are now published:

This research has led to the development of a guided self-help package for treating depression that consists of a workbook and an audio CD with mental exercises focused on thinking about difficulties in a more helpful concrete way. This self-help package is practised daily for 6 weeks, with guidance from a faciliatator consisting of one face-to-face coaching session and then 3 follow-up telephone sessions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>06752ED7-25F4-4E15-925C-AC3F70F9A754</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research has now established proof-of-principle that this approach repeated daily can reduce symptoms of depression. Pilot work in a multiple case series has demonstrated in patients with major depression that is safe, tolerable, and acceptable. The final phase of the MRC grant tested out the efficacy of the intervention in a Phase II small scale controlled trial (n =121), examining whether adding the brief guided self-help treatment to treatment as usual (GP management and, typically, antidepressant medication) produces better treatment outcomes for patients with major depression than treatment as usual alone. The results of the main outcome analysis indicate that the cognitive training guided self-help treatment adds significant clinical benefit in terms of reducing depression relative to treatment-as-usual alone, and that it is of equivalent efficacy to a relaxation based guided self-help treatment in reducing depression, but superior in changing depressogenic thinking such as rumination. This outcome has now been published in Psychological Medicine, a leading psychiatric journal. The project has therefore developed a novel treatment derived from experimental findings that is easily accessible, cost-effective and disseminable, and could be made widely available (for example via Improving Access to Psychological Treatments IAPT initiative or through e-mental health). This treatment material has been copyrighted. This intervention could have a significant impact on potential healthcare provision and policy, by integrating into the low-intensity approach to treatment a novel empirically-validated and cost-effective treatment that explicitly targets a core psychological process (rumination) in depression. There is interest from local NHS mental health services in adopting this treatment and adding it into the low intensity IAPT provision - we are currently planning and examining the means to develop suitable training and dissemination for the therapy. In addition, there is scope to adapt the therapy to be delivered through an internet-based platform and we envisage that this may be a focus of future research. The intervention is also influencing the development of prevention treatments to prevent depression and rumination in at risk adolescents.
Future work will examine the active ingredients of this intervention to refine its potency,</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>Cognitive training guided self-help</gtr:title><gtr:type>Therapeutic Intervention - Psychological/Behavioural</gtr:type><gtr:ukcrnIsctnId>39455344</gtr:ukcrnIsctnId><gtr:url>http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/Search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=4580</gtr:url><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2009</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/829E3E7D-A49A-4432-A0AA-4E56214F9ABA"><gtr:id>829E3E7D-A49A-4432-A0AA-4E56214F9ABA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Psychological treatment of depressive rumination</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Current Opinion in Psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9c1c1fb829679af88be88125da5f0f9f"><gtr:id>9c1c1fb829679af88be88125da5f0f9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watkins E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A4ACE330-9C00-4FF5-90B5-EAF79F469449"><gtr:id>A4ACE330-9C00-4FF5-90B5-EAF79F469449</gtr:id><gtr:title>Depressive rumination: investigating mechanisms to improve cognitive behavioural treatments.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Cognitive behaviour therapy</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95"><gtr:id>7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watkins ER</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1650-6073</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E5E552E2-8617-4C0D-8BEC-2753B26FE1F1"><gtr:id>E5E552E2-8617-4C0D-8BEC-2753B26FE1F1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dysregulation in level of goal and action identification across psychological disorders.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical psychology review</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9c1c1fb829679af88be88125da5f0f9f"><gtr:id>9c1c1fb829679af88be88125da5f0f9f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watkins E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0272-7358</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B407F07A-D990-4B46-AE99-AB84ADC67AD9"><gtr:id>B407F07A-D990-4B46-AE99-AB84ADC67AD9</gtr:id><gtr:title>Guided self-help concreteness training as an intervention for major depression in primary care: a Phase II randomized controlled trial.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Psychological medicine</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95"><gtr:id>7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watkins ER</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0033-2917</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DC1D3B31-8F8F-4C43-9A12-16D2F26569AD"><gtr:id>DC1D3B31-8F8F-4C43-9A12-16D2F26569AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Concreteness training reduces dysphoria: proof-of-principle for repeated cognitive bias modification in depression.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of abnormal psychology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95"><gtr:id>7f9fadc46892917cf903d4fa69c39a95</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watkins ER</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2009-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0021-843X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G0502003</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>AAFE74BF-2594-40A4-9487-23A469C7A3C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.6  Psychological and behavioural</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
