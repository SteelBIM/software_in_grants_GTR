It focuses on three African countries whose political and electoral histories have been very different - Ghana, Kenya and Uganda.

Non-academic users
The project is primarily concerned with questions of the management of elections, public attitudes towards and involvement in elections, and the performance of democracy, and the findings will be of great relevance to donor and civil-society efforts to strengthen electoral systems and the quality of democracy around the world. Users will include:
(1) NGOs, policy makers, and pro-democracy advocates in the three countries under study. These users will benefit from new information and high quality analyses of the relationship between electoral experience and political behaviour and attitudes, which will enable them to better understand public support/resistance to free and fair elections and to design better interventions.
(2) International promoters of free and fair elections in the UK policy community (FCO, DfID), in the international donor community (European Union, United Nations Development Program, US government) and in regional consultative bodies (African Union, East African Community). These users will benefit from comparative lessons on how new forms of electoral practice can reshape established expectations, and findings that will set out the conditions under which public support for free and fair elections is most likely to grow. 
(3) Legislators, political actors, interest groups, and citizens in the three countries under study will benefit from a greater understanding of the relationship between national level political leaders, electoral systems, electoral commissions, and popular attitudes. In particular, the project will generate new ideas about the nature of the barriers to free and fair elections, and the measures that can be taken to overcome them.
Principal academic beneficiaries 
(1) Academics studying elections, political culture and democratisation, who will benefit from advances in the study of the relationship between electoral process and political consciousness.
(2) Academics from a variety of disciplines who will benefit from a new network of interdisciplinary elections research through collaborative panels at international conferences, as well as dissemination workshops and conferences.
(3) Research assistants in the three countries under study, who will gain in capacity and research skills through training and the experience on an inter-disciplinary comparative project.
To maximise impact, dissemination strategies have been tailored to the specific needs of the academic and policy communities:
(1) Academic dissemination through specialist, comparative, and case study articles in international journals. Project findings will be publicised via conferences in Nairobi and London, and drawn together into a monograph co-authored by the investigators and submitted to a major university press.
(2) Policy and public dissemination through policy briefs, a final research report of 10,000 words, one-page press releases, media engagement, and the two conferences. 
User engagement, including the training of research assistants in communication and dissemination techniques will be the responsibility of Willis, Cheeseman and Lynch, who collectively have a track-record of high-impact research including:
(1) Multiple high-quality and widely-cited publications
(2) Policy briefings for the Cabinet Office, FCO, DfID, the World Bank, the US Department of State, and the Electoral Commission of the Government of Kenya.
(3) Ongoing research on the 2013 Kenyan elections, funded by the UK government's Africa Conflict Prevention Pool, and involving regular high-level briefings for staff from FCO, DfID and the Ministry of Defence, as well as representatives from foreign ministries of European Union partners
(4) Media appearances on television, radio, and print media in the UK and elsewhere.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>639887</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Justin Willis was one of three academics who designed and created this exhibition.

We also produced op-eds for international media, and for two newspapers in East Africa, reflecting on the wider lessons from Ghana's 2016 elections.
Uganda: we used a series of online and print newspaper articles (in the Washington Post Monkey Cage blog; the online Newsweek Europe magazine, Foreign Policy and the leading regional newspaper in East Africa, The East African) to present research findings; this led to a briefing for the donor support group on elections in Kampala in January 2016
Kenya: we have since 2014 been providing analysis to inform the forward planning of the FCO for elections (in Nairobi in September 2014, January 2016 and February 2017; in London November 2014 and July 2016). We have also engaged with donors more widely, through the EU mission to Kenya and through the Donor Group on Elections which coordinates electoral support from UK, US, EU and other governments: we met with these groups in January 2016 and February 2017, and expect increasingly frequent meetings in the coming months. In February 2017 the project team worked with a research NGO to design and deliver a course on Kenya's elections, aimed at those involved in election support and monitoring, and drawing on historical and comparative lessons. This was heavily over-subscribed, and eventually involved 43 participants. In January 2017, the project team were involved - with other academics - in a successful bid from the UK government's East African Research Fund for a project on 'Kenya's 2017 election: early warning and long-term monitoring'
The exhibition on 'The materiality of elections' created in 2015 with input for the project, has been displayed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam is currently on display in Bordeaux before moving to Paris next month.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2FD1FEBF-8600-4AEC-A46E-FB9D8083C715</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Confirmation that elections in Africa - and we suspect elsewhere - are subject to a distinct moral economy, a set of shared assumptions and norms about what constitutes appropriate electoral behaviour, which exist alongside and often in contradiction with statutory law and regulation. This drives and constrains the behaviour of both politicians and of voters, and is resilient in the face of legal interventions. Our survey and interview work have demonstrated that this varies both between and within countries, and is shaped by wider cultures of clientelism, by electoral experience and by individuals' positionally (in particular whether they support the ruling party). This demonstrates one of the key intuitions that motivated the research, and is a theme that we will continue to explore in the coming months. 
2. A confirmation of our sense that late-colonial regimes attached enormous significance to elections as a means to discipline both politicians and public and so manage an orderly transition to independence.
3. Evidence of the crucial post-independence variation in attitudes to elections. In Kenya, substantial energy and resources were repeatedly poured into the 'national exercise' of elections, because the government - after some internal debate - decided that it had a strong enough grip on power to risk these. As a result, single-party elections became a key site for the effective reproduction of state legitimacy. In Uganda, by contrast, the government was to unsure of its position to hold elections during the 1960s. Its legitimacy was fatally undermined. 
These two findings speak directly to our overall hypothesis, and suggest that participation in elections - where there is a degree of choice and malpractice is limited - can change political consciousness and attitudes to political process.

4. Evidence of the complex drivers of international election monitoring. A close study of the highly problematic 1980 Uganda elections - which saw the first deployment of a Commonwealth monitoring team in a nationally-administered election - has shown that the presence of the monitors was the product both of the international and institutional politics of the Commonwealth and of internal Ugandan politics. The study also shows that this first deployment manifested what have become recurring problems of monitoring:
a. that monitors are never fully able to observe the whole electoral process, and concentrate too much on the casting of ballots;
b. that it is very difficult for monitors to condemn flawed elections when they know that such condemnation will lead to violence.
The immediate consequence of the 1980 elections was the outbreak of civil war; in the longer term, qualitative evidence links this experience closely with scepticism toward the electoral process more generally.
