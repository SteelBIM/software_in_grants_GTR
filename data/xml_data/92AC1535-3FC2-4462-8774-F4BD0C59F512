Combining these fields has potentially transformative implications for both and may generate a new field of Engineering Design. 

Imagine a column of sand saturated with billions of engineered bacteria cells. As a force is applied to the top of the column, bacteria in the sand detect an increase in pressure. The bacteria respond by synthesising a new biological material to bind the grains together and resisting the load. The resulting structure would consist of a material where sand grains are only cemented where the forces through the material require.

We propose a proof of concept to show how we might design a manufacturing process where the material itself acts as manufacturer and designer, modelling and responding to its environment. Such a technology would push well beyond the current state of the art and challenge a new generation of engineering designers to think at multiple scales from molecular to the built environment and to anticipate civil engineering with living organisms.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will a significant impact across both academia and industry with the potential to develop a new field of engineering design. Where digital technologies were transformative in the 20th century, the 21st century is likely to be transformed through biotechnologies and fields such as synthetic biology. This project proposes bridging the gap between the design of biological systems at the molecular scale and the design of material structures at the scale of the human built environment. It is likely to generate significant interest and potential controversy. In addition to academic publications and a dissemination strategy which includes media coverage, therefore, the project proposes to:

*Generate Data to add to open access repositories including the MIT run Registry of Standard Biological Parts and the Newcastle University run Registry of Standard Virtual parts. In addition the project will create a new web based resource to bring the work together.

*Disseminate the research through a high profile public exhibition to take place at the 'Centre for Life' in Newcastle. The exhibition will act as a catalyst to initiate public debate on the project and form the basis of our media dissemination strategy.
 
*Develop an international network of interested academic and industry partners including Henk Jonkers at Delft University (who specialises in Self Healing concrete using bacteria biomineralisation), Neri Oxman at MIT (pioneer of material based computation), the AutoDesks Bio, Nano, Programmable Matter group.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>240435</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Delft University of Technology (TU Delft)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>Delft University Discussion and Presentation</gtr:description><gtr:id>E7512551-E7F3-441E-A562-2C90D5FDEECB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Methodological sharing - resulting in new ideas for the development of our key prototype.

The PI contributed an article
to 'The Conversation' and further articles on the project have featured in AAAS Science, The Times (print and online editions) and The Daily Mail Online. A Bloomberg produced video has been distributed across multiple media outlets including Yahoo News and MSN. We are also tracking articles in more than a dozen international media outlets across Europe, America and East Asia. While most of these outlets do not give readership data we do know that the Times print edition has a distribution of approx. 400,000 and the Conversation article has also been accessed over 20,000 times. Our project website ( www.synbio.construction ) has also received over 800 unique visitors per month since the Bloomberg video was released in November.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C2AAC9C4-0894-49C4-815C-A377537FF794</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We have developed a novel method using a purpose build pressure vessel to expose bacteria samples to pressures of 1MPa. Using a technique called RNA-Seq we found that one hundred genes were sensitive to pressure and that 26 of these genes displayed at least a 10-fold increased expression in response to our pressure condition.

We have engineered two strains of bacteria that carry a reporter system based on a GFP signaling gene integrated into the E. coli chromosome. GFP fluorescence was observed using light microscopy and was measured with a plate reader. We then successfully engineered a GFP tagged strain that displayed an increase of fluorescence in response to pressure and have chracterised the response from 0.1 - 1MPa.

We have developed a method in which bacteria can grow in a 3D volume of agar based hydrogels, then visualized and quantified cell distribution under a microscope for both E. coli and B. subtilise bacteria. The results from these tests allowed us to asses hydrogels as a soil substitute in WP2. We have ascertained that the hydrogels we are using have similar behavior to peat-type soils or soft clays.

We have built a finite element analysis model which integrates biological and geotechnical simulations to demonstrate variations in target gene expression for bacteria living in a body of soil, in response to pressure applied at the soil surface.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The discovery pf the moderate pressure sensing gene is likely to be of most immediate value to the academic community - along with the work done to characterise hydrogels.
