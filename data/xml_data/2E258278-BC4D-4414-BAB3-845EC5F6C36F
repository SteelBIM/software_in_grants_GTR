Significant levels of flare gas is released in the extraction of oil and gas. This was equivalent of 140 billion metres cube in
2011. The adoption of flare gas recovery units is dependent on a financial return as there is as yet no international
convention of flare gas emission currently enforecd. This project will explore the feasibility of using a two stage ejector
based system to compress the flare gas to a useful pressure rather than &amp;quot;flaring&amp;quot; it off. The current difficulties with this
proposed system are: i) at elevated waste gas inlet pressure to the second stage ejector, currently at elevated suction
pressure the efficiency of the ejector is reduced significantly. ii) multistage ejector systems rely on phase separation
between stages, Transvac currently does not possess the necessary information on optimal separation technology for this
application. If these issues could be overcome then the multistage system would represent a significant reduction in both
the cost of flare gas recovery system installation and operation, making the process more feasible for installation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Economy: The proposed development would lead to Product security, Wealth generation and investment, and generation
of employment.
Environment: Reducing the flare gas would contribute to minimizing the CO2 output. This will provide means to meeting the
CO2 reduction targets.
People: New product development proposed here would lead to new skills improving the employability of people.
Society: The end result would see contributions towards improvement of life standards by improving the gas recovery and
improving the air quality through minimal flaring.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>74861</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Transvac Systems Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Multistage Ejectors</gtr:description><gtr:id>BDEF7B1C-A601-48B1-9BAA-DC5E7C43A00F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Internal technical report on separator selection and design has been produced.

The grant enabled us to investigate what was considered as conventional technology in a different light that lead to considerable improvement to capture the interest of the industries. This has led to a considerable increase in company's revenue contributing to the growth of the economy of the country. The increased sales has generated several employment opportunities for the locals providing transferable skills and technology training. This has and would improve the local economy and reduce social problems due to unemployment. The technology developed during this project is in an increasing trend of being applied to reduce flare gas in relevant industries reducing their CO2 emissions improving local air quality; hence the quality of life in local communities. Further it addresses the global environmental problems to certain extent making an impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C40142F5-7522-4001-BFC1-31F84325344B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The task is to work with a company that intend to develop a multi stage ejector compressor system to recover flare gas.
