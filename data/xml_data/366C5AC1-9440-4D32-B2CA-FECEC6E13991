&lt;p>The recent trend of increasing arrivals of 'extra-continental' migrants and refugees, many from conflicts in Africa and the Middle East, raise substantive challenges of security and justice for Latin American societies. At the same time, particularly in Central America, new patterns of gang- and drug-related generalised violence are producing extensive forced displacement. As States in the region seek to balance societal fears about terrorism and criminality against their international obligations to protect refugees, they look to develop new forms of transnational cooperation on asylum and migration. This international cooperation builds on existing regional initiatives. However, no recent or comprehensive studies of this topic exist.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research analyses these regional responses to forced migration in Latin America. Among the far-reaching questions are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>What are the implications for security and justice of these new dynamics? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How do Latin American States respond to such challenges, and how can their responses be strengthened in future? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the implications for States' allocation of international responsibility for flows of refugees?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1. The project's main practical objective is to contribute to resolving the justice and security challenges that new forms of forced migration present to Latin American societies. This long-term impact will be realised through the fulfilment of five short-to-medium term impacts 'through people'. These impacts will be secured through targeted activities to maximise the opportunities for users in the public sector (State), third sector (international agencies, civil society) and the wider public to benefit maximally from the research. These pathways are grounded in my robust networks of contacts from research in South America in 2005-2012. 

(a) Law, policy and practice: Latin American States

The initial pathway for achieving positive changes in this area is through the directors of the government refugee offices in the relevant States. A 'contact group' of key officials from ten selected Latin American States will be created to feed informally into the research during 2012-2014 and maximise its exposure to users. This participation will also provide the basis for further impact during the 2015 State conference in London, which will share the research outputs and targeted legal submissions for improvements to laws etc. Follow-up will be conducted remotely from the UK. 

(b) Policy and practice: Regional organisations

The regional nature of the problem requires a coordinated response from international organisations such as the OAS. The State-related activities mentioned above constitute one impact pathway at this level, which will be utilised also by the project for this purpose. However, the key OAS, EU and AU officials in this field will also be invited to participate fully in the activities of the contact group 2012-2015. This represents a pathway for impact on these international organisations parallel to the State route, and discussions between the regional organisations would also be encouraged as an additional pathway for fortifying the research impact. 

(c) Policy and practice: International agencies

UNHCR and the ICRC require research on this topic to orient policy and practice with governments and victims. Workshops will be organised with each agency as a platform for engaging these agencies on certain research questions, participation in the 2015 State conference and academic conferences/workshops, and dissemination of the research outputs in the relevant divisions. Since these agencies advise States and fund civil society organisations in this field, impact upon these agencies will be extended considerably as a result of their influence upon States and local partners in the field.

(d) Practice: Civil society in Latin America

Civil society is crucial to refugee protection in Latin America but lacks research resources. My strong contacts in this sector enable me both to influence their engagement in the knowledge exchange processes described above and help strengthen their internal policies in this area. Participation from relevant civil society will take place in the academic knowledge exchange activities. 

(e) Perceptions in Latin American society

The media presentation of forced migrants in Latin America can be shallow and unrepresentative. Using my UK, Latin American and international media contacts and those of my mentors, I will seek to promote a more informed debate through writing newspaper and web articles, giving interviews on radio and television, and speaking at selected public events. 

2. Impact through these pathways will be mutually reinforcing, e.g. impact on the policy of international agencies, which influences State policy. 

3. The project also yields 'international leadership' and 'partnerships' impacts by fortifying academic-practitioner collaboration, stimulating the co-production of knowledge, and increasing the visibility of UK academic research. Such collaborations will form the basis for further research and dialogue on security, conflict and justice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168689</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Advice to Thomson Reuters Mexico Correspondent (Displacement in Central America)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BAA1B398-3917-4515-AB4B-7093F06CE28E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Information used as background in researching story

A. Governmental responses to cross-border environmental displacement in Latin America

1. I presented my research on this topic at a workshop organised by the Nansen Initiative (an intergovernmental initiative led by the Governments of Norway and Switzerland) and the Regional Conference on Migration (RCM, an international organisation comprised of eleven North and Central American governments, i.e. Canada, USA, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama), hosted by the Government of Costa Rica, in February 2015. Following that workshop, the RCM requested that a set of guidelines on the protection of persons displaced across a border by natural disasters be drafted for their consideration, based on my research and other workshop input. I produced the first drafts of these guidelines, which are now under consideration by the eleven RCM government (Belize, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, United States, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama and Dominican Republic) for adoption in November 2016 as a regional framework for the RCM. If adopted, they will be the world's first ever international or regional guidelines on the protection of persons displaced across a border by natural disasters.

2. Through the Refugee Law Initiative (of which I am Director), I organised a similar meeting for South American governments jointly with the Nansen Initiative, hosted by the Government of Ecuador, in July 2015. The presentation of my research and that carried out by other research project members resulted in an interest on the part of governments in taking forward a similar initiative to the RCM guidelines within the Common Market of the South (MERCOSUR, an international organisation comprised of Southern Cone and some Andean governments). This is being followed-up by the successor organisation to the Nansen Initiative (called the Platform on Disaster Displacement and led by the Governments of Germany and Bangladesh) with my input during 2016-17.

3. My project research on this topic equally underpins the key legal status section of the Agenda for the Protection of Cross-Border Displaced Persons in the Context of Natural Disasters and Climate Change, a framework of best practices presented at its October 2015 Global Consultation in Switzerland, and endorsed by 109 governments. 

4. I also presented my closely-related project research on migrants and displaced persons in Latin American countries affected by natural disasters or armed conflict at the regional consultation of the Migrants in Countries in Conflict (MICIC, an initiative of the International Organisation for Migration led by the Governments of the Philippines and the USA), hosted by Government of Costa Rica, in February 2016. This research on Latin America feeds into the final guidelines on this issue adopted by the MICIC process in 2016.

5. Both the Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda and the MICIC Guidelines were cited positively in the report prepared by the UN Secretary General for the summit on Large-Scale Movements of Refugees and Migrants held by the UN General Assembly in September 2016.

B. Organised crime: the new motor of forced displacement in Latin America

6. My project research on current dynamics of displacement caused by organised crime in Latin America, alongside the project expert workshop organised by the Refugee Law Initiative jointly with the Universidad Centroam&amp;eacute;ricana in El Salvador in May 2014, fed directly into the Cartagena+30 Process. This process is organised every ten years by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to commemorate the 1984 Cartagena Declaration and involves Latin American States adopting a Declaration and ten-year Plan of Action on Refugees and Displacement in the region. My project recommendations were adopted in full by the sub-regional Mesoamerican consultation (Mexico and Central America) where I presented them and incorporated into the first draft of the plan of action. The 2014 Brazil Declaration and Plan of Action, adopted by all Latin American and Caribbean governments in December 2014, retains a number of recommendations resulting from my project. Partly as a result of my project, this is also the first ever international instrument to officially recognise the issue of displacement caused by organised crime.

7. In the inter-governmental implementation meeting following the adoption of the Brazil Declaration/Plan, held in Italy in January 2015, I was invited by UNHCR to present recommendations on the chapter of the Plan dealing with displacement caused by organised crime. My recommendations - based on my project research - provided the framework for both governments and UNHCR to move forward on this issue.

8. My project research serves as a basis for the development of global protection policy by UNHCR for displaced persons fleeing organised criminal violence in the Northern Triangle of Central America. This impacts not only on UNHCR's own activities but also those of governments in the region who receive claims for protection from persons from these countries. Between October 2015 and February 2016, I was asked by UNHCR to work with them in developing such protection policy relating to El Salvador. Between January and March 2016, I have been helping UNHCR to develop protection policy relating to Honduras. Between March and May 2016, I have committed to helping UNHCR to develop protection policy relating to Guatemala.

9. Between June and July 2016, I was asked by UNHCR to draft a regional policy for addressing the displacement crisis in and from the Northern Triangle of Central America that would delineate new actions to be taken for the protection of internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and deportees with protection needs by governments (including the Governments of Canada, USA, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and other observer Governments from the region and beyond), international agencies and civil society in the countries of origin, transit and destination. This proposal was then presented at an inter-governmental meeting convened by UNHCR and the Organization of American States in July, hosted by the Government of Costa Rica, named the 'Call to Action'. The participants in this meeting discussed the proposed policy approach and adopted a public statement of principles called the 'San Jos&amp;eacute; Action Statement', to which were appended a range of specific concrete commitments for action in favour of the different vulnerable population groups in these countries.

10. My project research on this topic also provided a baseline/conceptual point of reference for the first ever official profiling study on displacement caused by organised crime that was carried out by the Government of Honduras in collaboration with the Joint IDP Profiling Service in 2014 and 2015 and published in December 2015.

11. Throughout the project, I gave interviews and provided background to a range of international print, radio and television journalists on refugee issues in Latin America, particularly on the flight from Central America of large number of children and adults towards the USA in 2014 and 2015.

12. Anecdotally from conversations and email exchanges with refugee law practitioners, especially in the USA, I understand that my research is relied upon extensively as a core piece of background evidence submitted in legal proceedings when litigating claims for asylum by persons from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. I have also acted as an expert witness in several such claims before the courts. This is combined with other activities in the region. For instance, in September 2016, I provided targeted specialist advice to various Salvadorian NGOs who are preparing a draft law for the protection of internally displaced persons in El Salvador that will be put before the legislature for consideration.

C. Legal protection of refugees in Latin America

13. My project research (with project research assistant Diana Trimi&amp;ntilde;o) proposing an alternative approach to interpreting the extended Latin American refugee definition in Conclusion III of the 1984 Cartagena Declaration (which has been incorporated into the national law of 16 Latin American countries) was presented in front of a special UNHCR-convened workshop of national and other experts in Uruguay in 2013 on the 'Interpretation of the Expanded Refugee Definition included in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees'. It is reflected in the resulting UNHCR Summary Conclusions on the interpretation of the extended refugee definition in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration. 

D. Upcoming future impact on refugee/displaced person protection in Latin America

14. I recently accepted an invitation from the Director of the UNHCR Americas Bureau (which covers all of the Americas from Canada to Chile/Argentina) to take up a one-year part-time secondment from October 2016 as the Senior Adviser (Policy and Strategy) to the Americas Bureau. This invitation is based partly on recognition of my research expertise and knowledge of forced displacement and refugee situations in the Americas accumulated during this research project. Below the Bureau Director, this will be the most senior policy-development role in the Americas Bureau (reflected in its P-5 grading on the UN professional staff scale) and will involve drawing on this expertise to draft such key policy as the UNHCR multi-year strategy 2017-20 for the whole region, as well as legal and operational policies and parameters in relation to new and developing situations of forced displacement in this region.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>499A595F-D639-422F-B01B-2281138C07E7</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This interdisciplinary research project generated a range of significant new knowledge outcomes about forced migration in Latin America and transnational responses by States in that region. As such, it has begun to redress the long-standing neglect by scholars of refugee law and protection in Latin America. 

The main research findings can be summarised under the following thematic headings:

1. Organised crime: the new motor of forced displacement in Latin America

Based on field research carried out across Central America and Mexico, the research project produced the first serious study of the dynamics of forced migration provoked not by war or government persecution but by the activities of organised criminal groups. This research, including an open access article that is now the 'most read' article in the Refugee Survey Quarterly journal, showed how the range of violent organised criminal groups in Central America and Mexico have generated different forms and patterns in both the displacement in these countries and the protection and security challenges faced by those who flee their violence. The project has spearheaded the study of this 'new' cause of forced displacement in the wider field of refugee and forced migration studies.

2. Governmental responses to cross-border environmental displacement in Latin America

Based on legal research and expert interviews, and set against the frequently-bemoaned silence of international law relating to environmental displacement, the research project produced a ground-breaking analysis of how governments in a region such as Latin America actually use a range of little-known national laws and policies to respond to cross-border displacement caused by natural disasters and climate change. In the field of environmental migration, law and governance, this Americas-based study has shifted attention beyond a narrow focus on the realm of international law and onto a more fine-grained consideration of governmental practices at the domestic level in particular regions of the world.

3. Legal protection of refugees in Latin America

Based on archival and legal research, and expert interviews, the research project has shifted three traditional notions concerning the legal protection of refugees in Latin America. Firstly, through an historical study this project developed a simpler and more elegant interpretation of the famous Latin American expanded refugee definition in the 1984 Cartagena Declaration. Secondly, it uncovered and elucidated an expansive and progressive human rights-based framework for the protection of asylum-seekers and refugees in the doctrine of the Inter-American Human Rights System. Finally, it interrogated the purported 'liberal tide' of immigration law and policy in this region in light of more restrictive practices by some Latin American States that are influenced by European approaches to asylum. Collectively, these findings show how Latin American cooperation in the field of refugee protection offers an alternative regional model to other models currently applied in Europe and elsewhere in the world. 

Finally, on methodology, a key finding of the project concerned the unexpected challenge that, owing to the controversial nature of the subject matter, no single interviewee was willing to consent to their interview data being uploaded to a data repository.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My findings have already generated substantial impact among users in the public sector, third sector and wider public, as well as helping to shape academic debate in the areas identified above. Even so, the potential exists for additional impact in the coming months through new pathways. 

1. Organised crime

Governments and UNHCR and currently developing programmes in Latin America to protect persons displaced by organised crime (2014 Brazil Plan of Action). This presents a diverse range of new opportunities to put my research findings to practical use in aiding the design of these programmes.

2. Environmental displacement

The 2015 Paris climate agreement offers new impetus and opportunities to cement and extend disaster displacement policy frameworks - such as the global Nansen Initiative Protection Agenda and efforts by Latin American governments to develop sub-regional instruments - in which my research findings have the potential to play a key role.

3. Refugee law

Governments, humanitarian actors and NGOs are currently scaling up their legal protection work with refugees in Latin America (driven mainly by a concern for Central American refugees). Their renewed interest and presence in the region provides many openings for using my research findings to influence future refugee law development
