That earlier study identified a significant degree of disengagement amongst young people, of whom only 39 per cent voted at the 2001 General Election.

The current study will focus upon a new generation of young people a decade later, and will examine whether or not their views about the political and democratic process differ from those recorded in 2002 ? and if so how.

Firstly we will conduct a national online questionnaire survey amongst 1,000 18 year olds (voters and non-voters). Secondly we will carry out online focus groups with young people who opted not to vote at the recent 2010 General Election. Supplementing the survey with the use of focus groups will enable us to gain insights into what it is that influences young people?s decisions to abstain from voting, and what are the means by which young people might be reconnected to the political process.

The study is innovative in its use of online methods which will help to increase accessibility and the appeal of participation in the study for young people.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>77635</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young people and politics in Britain today (Michigan State University, London, July 2011)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61906B8A-36DF-4188-8AFE-AE5650911738</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited lecture for the Michigan State University 'Political Science Summer Programme' Contemporary Political Activity in Britain, Regent's College, London, July 21st 2011

We have consulted with several stakeholder groups with an interest in citizenship issues. At the project design stage, we consulted with all of the main political parties (Labour, Conservatives, LibDems, Greens, SNP, Plaid Cymru). We also consulted with the Citizenship Foundation, NUS, Institute for Citizenship, British Youth Council.

We have delivered invited presentations of the research to events with audiences of practitioners who have a specific and scientific interest in the project. These include:
? We have offered expert-evidence for shaping BBC Radio 1's &amp;quot;youth vs politics&amp;quot; voter apathy week (July 2012), and are currently discussing extending this work in advance of the 2015 UK General Election.
? Invited presentation to a training event for youth activists (Labour Party Annual Conference, 2011)
? Invited presentation to 'The Participation of Young People in British Democracy' workshop, Royal Holloway (March, 2013). The audience included practitioners from several citizenship agencies
? IPPR North - invited presentations in Newcastle (February 2013) and Manchester (June 2013)
? Electoral Commission (invited lecture, June 2013)
? The project has also been reported in the national and professional media. 
? Invited opening paper at the Community Engagement and the Individual Electoral Registration (IER) Experience conference, Local Area Research and Intelligence Association (LARIA), Manchester (April 2014 - details at http://laria.org.uk/?p=2250) 

We have been commissioned to write guest articles for publications with high user/practitioner audiences as follows:

Nonetheless, it would appear that the political system and the established parties and politicians that dominate it, are together failing to provide the stimuli necessary to encourage young people to engage with formal politics; their recent experience of their first general election in 2010 has left them feeling disheartened. 

Young people's orientation towards formal politics is complex and nuanced. The data from both the survey and from the focus groups reveal:
- There is evidence of a gender gap. Young men are more interested than women in politics, have greater confidence in their knowledge and understanding of politics, and, to some extent, consider that there are greater opportunities open to them to influence the political process.
- There is also some evidence that ethnicity impacts on young people's political outlook. Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) youth groups are somewhat dubious about their prospects for influencing the political process, and are more sceptical of political parties as mechanisms for representation than are white respondents. They are, however, somewhat more supportive of elections.
- Social class exerts a considerably strong impact on political engagement. Those from predominantly middle class households appear to be much more interested in political affairs than are young working class people. They also have greater confidence in their own knowledge and understanding of such matters, are less critical of elections, and are more committed to the democratic process. 

? Educational career appears to have a crucial bearing on young people's political engagement: 
- Those in possession of higher level educational qualifications are particularly confident in their own knowledge and understanding of politics, and tend to feel voting and elections offers valuable avenues towards representation. They also are more likely to have a positive view of the ways in which political parties operate than are those with lower level educational qualifications.
- Similarly, remaining in (full-time) education has a clear and consistent impact on their political engagement. Although continuing students feel that there are few opportunities available to influence the political world, they are more interested and confident in their knowledge and understanding of politics than are those who have left full-time education. They are also more supportive of elections, have greater faith in the value of voting, and are more inclined to see political parties as effective organisations.

If young people are to be re-connected to the formal political process, then there is considerable scope for professional politicians to assist in this process. The research indicates that young people would welcome an approach from the political parties and from individual politicians that was direct, on-going and clearly prompted by a desire to genuinely articulate and champion the interests of this generation.

Furthermore, the research results suggest that government social policies that succeed in expanding educational participation and reducing social class differences and social exclusion, may all contribute in helping to limit the drift towards further political disengagement amongst youth in Britain.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This research will be of value to organisations seeking to help find ways to re-connect young people to the formal political process. Our research findings clearly indicate that politicians will need to adopt approaches that are direct, on-going and clearly prompted by a desire to genuinely articulate and champion the interests of today's youth generation. Furthermore, government social policies that succeed in expanding educational participation and reducing social class differences, may all contribute in helping re-engage British youth.

Young people do not feel confident in their own knowledge and understanding of politics to make effective and informed choices about how best to participate - including how to vote in elections. Political parties, politicians and citizenship groups should therefore explore ways to make information about politics more accessible.

Extending and enhancing citizenship education in schools might help provide the political literacy skills necessary for young people to intervene in and connect with British democracy in a more effective and confident way. 

Today's youth consider themselves to be relatively powerless, politically and the political system is viewed as closed. Politicians and others need to work with young people to design effective structures through which they can participate in political affairs more effectively.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>93008520-ED4A-49B2-931C-07AC54037DEA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ntu.ac.uk/apps/research/groups/22/home.aspx/project/148408/overview/young_people_and_politics_in_britain</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FEE94A3A-BFB9-4048-A060-C56664BF5990"><gtr:id>FEE94A3A-BFB9-4048-A060-C56664BF5990</gtr:id><gtr:title>Politicians fail to win young people's vote</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>ESRC -
