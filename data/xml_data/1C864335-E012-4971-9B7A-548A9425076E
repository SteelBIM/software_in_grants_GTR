Barriers to communication and circulation between neighbourhoods have been linked to diminished self-esteem and decreased social capital and social networks. This project will test this link by studying 1) the relationship between the porosity of internal city borders, self-esteem and resilience and 2) the role of bottom-up social development initiatives in building resilience and enhancing the flexibility of city borders. This will be studied in segregated neighbourhoods (favelas) of three large Brazilian cities: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Porto Alegre. A comparative framework between multiple sites furthers understanding of how different built environments and contexts intersect with the psychology and resilience of individuals and communities. At the same time we will identify initiatives of bottom-up social development and study their role in developing resilience and capacity to act on urban frontiers, which, we hypothesise, is an important factor in the quality of urban transformation. 

The work to be carried out involves building a research partnership between Brazil and the UK through 2 workshops in London and Porto Alegre, which will focus on all elements of preparing and designing the research. We will review the literature connecting social psychology and urban studies and establish the research design. The workshops will draw on previous research of members of the network and bring together colleagues with different expertise on the connections between environments, self-esteem and resilience. It will involve young researchers from both countries, including PhD students. This network will make an important and novel contribution by developing conceptual and empirical links between social and cultural psychology and urban studies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will study vulnerable and excluded communities of large Brazilian cities and in particular their agency and capacity for change in rapidly transforming urban environments. It will contribute to the welfare and socio-economic development of Brazil in so far as it will expand the understanding of how disenfranchised social actors can themselves develop strategies for changing their lives and environments for the best. 

Potential beneficiaries and users to be involved in the project include 1) third-sector organisations, specifically those which we will be studying in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and the London-based charity Kids Company, whose work with the most vulnerable children in London is directly linked to neighbourhood borders and urban transformations; 2) practitioners in the public and private sector, specifically urban planners and architects who can incorporate in design and planning the role of flexible borders in the agency and psychosocial development of individuals and communities; 3) UNESCO-Brasilia Office, given our established partnership in the projects Underground Sociabilities and Communicating Bottom-up Social Development. UNESCO have been committed to sharing our research knowledge via their delegations globally and we are confident that they will be involved in the current development. Finally, 4) the Government of Brazil, specifically the Ministry of Cities, with whom we have worked in the past and continue to advise.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41531</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Universidade Federal de Rio de Janeiro</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Brazil, Federative Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Porosity of Borders</gtr:description><gtr:id>1BFADA27-4219-43D8-8ADC-98969DB80D69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Inter-institutional, international research collaboration

We participated presenting our research in the panel on &amp;quot;Inclusive Urban Development: what works?&amp;quot;, which included the Mayors of Birmingham, Alabama, US and Nouakchott, Mauritania as well as the Chief Officer for Cultural Diversity and Race Relations of the City of Saskatoon, Cananda.
Sandra Jovchelovitch acted as a panel member. 
The panel connected to SDG 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, and Goal 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. Central to the aims of the panel were to discuss ways to strengthen global commitment to sustainable urbanisation with emphasis on how cities can embrace their diverse populations.
