Yet the way in which biodiversity affects different services is poorly understood scientifically, especially when considering the real world rather than small-scale studies. Lowland agricultural landscapes are particular 'crunch' points, where food security needs to be balanced with the provision of other ecosystem services against the backdrop of a changing climate. Many of these services are in conflict, such as crop production, climate regulation and cultural services. Already, agricultural landscapes show signs of degradation, with consequences for their biodiversity and the provisioning and resilience of services.

The 'Wessex-BESS' project will address the fundamental challenge of the BESS program in linking biodiversity change with the delivery of ecosystem services across landscapes and into the future. We will do this by integrating experiments with large-scale biodiversity and environmental gradients existing in the Wessex Chalk landscape. This contains arable, grassland and riverine ecosystems, and offers a unique opportunity to exploit large-scale 'natural experiments'. Specifically, Salisbury Plain contains large areas of unfragmented semi-natural habitat and shares the topography and deeper chalk soils of surrounding intensive farmland, making comparisons possible. Furthermore, the area contains many ecological restoration programmes that we will use as experimental platforms for large-scale biodiversity manipulations. To allow the broad characterisation of biodiversity-ecosystem service relationships, and a framework for other researchers to exploit, research will encompass: a wide range of ecosystems from terrestrial to freshwater; taxonomic groups from bacteria to birds; multiple biodiversity measures from genetic and species diversity to landscape heterogeneity; and regulating, provisioning and cultural services. Collaboration with other initiatives using this landscape (incl. NERC 'Macronutrients Cycle', Defra 'Test Catchments', Natural England 'Nature Improvement Areas') will add scientific value and impact, and partnership with a large number of conservation and land/water management organisations will ensure the research and findings have applied and policy relevance.

We have a consortium comprising international leaders in biodiversity and ecosystem service research. Project partners will ensure that scientific outcomes influence best practice and policy. The collaborative approach (with partners involved in ecosystem service provision) represents a cost-effective way to understand the scaling of biodiversity-service relationships. The Wessex Chalk Area is an excellent test bed for possible futures as it faces imminent threats from both climate and land use change (e.g. agricultural intensification), which are already being addressed using large-scale restoration. We will focus on the contrasting services of crop production, climate regulation, water quality, and cultural services.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Today, ca. 80% of the Earth's land surface shows evidence of human intervention. Radical action is needed to sustain well-functioning ecosystems and biodiversity, which together assure the delivery of ecosystem services at the level needed for a healthy planet and thus our own existence. These ecosystem services are benefits humans obtain from nature, and they underpin human well-being, by providing such essential goods as clean water, climate regulation, improved crop yield, hazard prevention, and a pleasant environment. By examining the provision of services for a particular landscape - the Wessex Chalk -and the underpinning role of biodiversity, this project will benefit society as a whole by demonstrating essential ecosystem services in the UK and by determining mechanisms to maintain services in a changing environment. 
To consider more specific benefits. Local to the Wessex Chalk landscape, we have engaged with a wide range of end-users from the conception of the proposed research. They have actively helped to develop the proposal and guide the research by identifying their individual needs. The social science research in the project will broaden out form these specific contacts to consider benefits and involvement of a wider range of members of society, involving individuals as well as organisations. Thus, the research will provide real benefits and utility to local people and organisations. More broadly, the research will underpin policy efforts to focus activities on maintaining and enhancing ecosystem services. International activities include: Council of Europe - 2010 'A headline target of halting the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystem services in the EU by 2020&amp;quot;; the Nagoya 2010 new CBD 2020 targets including resilience of ecosystem services; the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including Aichi Biodiversity Targets; the Inter-governmental Science-Policy Platform for Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ; and TEEB (the ecology and economics of biodiversity). UK activities include: the UKNEA aiming to enhance understanding of the state of ecosystem services; Lawton review 'Making Space for Nature' and the linked Environment White Paper. These efforts are against a background of the need for increased food security, climate change and other major drovers of change. By linking mechanistic research with a detailed analysis of policy and societal needs, we will provide scientific evidence to inform future decisions</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>438248</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Kenya, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>TESSA CES toolkit</gtr:description><gtr:id>6AED81AE-5965-4137-80FE-1206E38B86F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing survey development and paper</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Developing a survey template to quantify cultural ecosystem services</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Research Team member Helen King invited as an expert contributor to the Toolkit for Ecosystem Service Site-Based Assessment (TESSA) 2 day workshop (Cambridge, June 2014).

Finally, links have been forged with local stakeholders and organisations and this should provide opportunities to further contribute to and inform the debate on local development. We are working with stakeholders now to develop a cultural services DSS that is useful to them and a range of products from our data that will help them understand the where and how in the landscape cultural services are generated.

1. How are cultural services generated: A key part of the project so far has focussed on identifying what cultural services are and how they are generated. 

Cultural services benefits as observed from the exploratory workshops included cognitive, intuitive, creative, restorative, retrospective, and communicative benefits. A range of antecedent social conditions and individual attributes condition and configure the way in which these benefits are experienced by individuals. Pragmatic issues such as access rights linked to the environmental setting govern and influence the type of activity and interaction with the environment. 

2. Development of a conceptual framework of cultural services: A key part of the effort has been to develop a conceptual framework to encapsulate how cultural services are generated, what the pathways are, and how this relates to wellbeing. This conceptual framework has been used to generate a set of social constructs and items that can be used to investigate cultural ecosystem services using qualitative and quantitative approaches, with the eventual aim of allowing others to build and adapt the questions for their own purposes. 

For example, we are hopeful that this will be an important overall contribution to understanding of ecosystem services and indeed we are making a contribution to the TESSA toolkit cultural services component. 
 
3. New datasets on cultural services: Data collected so far from exploratory workshops show that the cultural ecosystem services associated with different gradients of biodiversity are mediated by familiarity with particular landscapes. The scale at which biodiversity is perceived appears to be linked to educational background as well as the type of recreation that is undertaken. 

Data are now being collected from the on-line questionnaire. At this early stage, these data so far suggest that people value cultural services derived from ancient grasslands more highly than from arable land. 

4. Student teaching and research in cultural services: As a University, we are introducing these ideas into the teaching and learning of students. For example, four students (see thesis publications) have undertaken their research on cultural services drawing on ideas from the project and also contributing to the project. A PhD studentship linking to scaling issues in ecosystem services delivery is also linking into the project. 

Building on these findings so far, in the coming year, we are intending to undertake a range of further data collection exercises, including a survey of residents and visitors, and interviews with farmers, and other stakeholders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research is still ongoing. However a wide range of end-users are currently being engaged in and are part of the research. The approach taken is a collaborative research approach in which individual users are able to fertilise the research. A range of stakeholders include public bodies, NGOs and the general public, and private companies. Many of these end-users are formal Project Partners, which will facilitate both their active engagement in the research and their implementation of the research findings in the Wessex Chalk region. The project also aims to engage end-users every 6 months during end user meetings project staff have attended and contributed to these meetings. So far, public participation in the project has been achieved through stakeholder workshops and an on-line questionnaire, that allows users to identify locations of particular importance to them and identify what is of value to them from different types of countryside. Further activities are planned including a major survey of public, detailed interviews with farmers and selected key informants and visualisation workshops.
