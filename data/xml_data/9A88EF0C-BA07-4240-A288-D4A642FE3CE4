Although heat waves have been relatively rare in the UK, they are projected to become more common and intense under a changing climate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The summer of 2013 brought the first heat wave in seven years. To promote public protection against heat, the National Health Service and Public Health England released a heat wave plan. Recommended heat protection behaviours include staying in the shade, drinking plenty of liquids, and keeping an eye on vulnerable individuals. However, there is reason to believe that UK residents often have positive feelings about hot summer weather, which may undermine their willingness to implement recommended heat protection behaviours.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This UK-wide project examines whether UK residents? positive feelings about hot summer weather did indeed undermine their willingness to implement heat protection behaviours during the 2013 heat wave. It also tests four strategies for promoting heat protection behaviours, including ones that invoke negative memories about extreme summer heat. Follow-up work will apply any new insights to other extreme weather events, like floods, droughts or snow. Findings will impact theory and practice about how to design effective risk communication, and help to promote public preparedness and resilience regarding extreme weather.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Because our study aims to understand how to best promote public preparedness for heat, the ultimate beneficiaries include any individuals who are at risk for heat-related death, heat-related illness, and discomfort. These risks could be reduced if people received effective communications about how to protect themselves from heat. Effective communications are needed because UK residents perceive hot summers as rare (Fuller &amp;amp; Bulkeley, 2012; Harley, 2003), do not expect that climate change will lead to more heat waves in the UK (Lorenzoni et al., 2006), and do not seem to perceive themselves at risk even if they are vulnerable to heat (Abrahamson et al., 2009; Fuller &amp;amp; Bulkeley, 2012; Wolf et al., 2010). If our strategies for motivating people to implement heat protection are indeed effective, they can be easily applied to existing communications about heat risk, for widespread dissemination to UK residents. We will publicly release training materials about how to design effective communications, based on the PI's and international co-I's expertise in writing such how-to guides (Bruine de Bruin &amp;amp; Bostrom, in press; Fischhoff et al., 2011). International Co-I Fischhoff (2011) designed such a how-to guide for the US Food and Drug Administration. 
Other beneficiaries include organisations that design communications with the goal of encouraging people to protect against heat. The effectiveness of such communications has not yet been formally evaluated. The 2013 Heat Wave Plan of the National Health Service (NHS) and Public Health England (PHE) recommends heat-protection strategies, but little is known about people's willingness to implement these strategies, or how to improve it (Kovats &amp;amp; Hajat, 2008). NHS and PHE will be asked for input before we conduct our survey so that it better meets their needs for understanding public responses to heat waves. Co-I Dr. Kovats will provide insights and connections from her current fellowship, which involves work with stakeholders to understand how to promote public preparedness for climate change. We will also give these organisations our findings and the training materials for designing communications (as discussed above), so that they can use them and share them with their network. Our findings and how-to training materials will be posted on a project website linked to the website of our Centre for Decision Research at the University of Leeds. We will invite other users to contact us if they want us to provide direct feedback on how to improve their communications.
Additional beneficiaries are policy makers (e.g., Department of Health) who aim to protect people from heat-related risks such as death, illness and discomfort. Policies may take different forms, including for example heat warnings and action plans, or regulations and subsidies to promote cooler buildings. Communications are typically an important part of any such policies. If we can identify effective strategies for promoting people's willingness to protect themselves against heat, then policy makers will be able to apply those strategies to their communications. Although our work will be focused on the UK, we will share our findings in outreach workshops to international policy makers as organised by the International Risk Governance Council and the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy. 
Finally, indirect beneficiaries are practitioners, policy makers and academics who aim to help people to reduce the risks that they face in their lives. Although our work will focus on public responses to heat waves in the UK, any identified strategies for promoting risk protection may be applicable to other risks. We have studied various health, environmental and financial risks. We plan to take the proposed work forward by testing the usefulness of any effective communication strategies in helping people to protect against these other risks. We will make effective strategies publicly available, with training materials.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>166247</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Carnegie Mellon University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8A4E1B5-9648-41FF-95B8-8D498F69B6A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>* December 2013: Academic conference presentation.

Abstract: In their lives, people face decisions about risks affecting their health, finances, and environmental footprint. Experts in different domains may be asked to develop communications with the goal of improving people's judgments and decisions about specific risks. Such communication efforts may fail if experts lack information about what wording people prefer to use to describe relevant concepts, what information people need or want to know to make more informed decisions, and what barriers people experience when trying to change their behavior. In this presentation, I will present the social science behind effective communication development.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Featured in 'Britain in 2015' Magazine</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C09746CA-6B54-48FB-81CB-D84119ECAA6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Britain in 2015 discussed our main findings and implications for policy making about climate change and public preparedness for heatwaves.

Abstract: Members of the general public and stakeholders from industry and government face difficult decisions about environmental and health risks. Experts in environmental and health domains face the challenge of communicating about those risks to various audiences without a background in health or environmental science. Such communication efforts may fail if experts lack an understanding of their audience, what language they prefer, and what information they need or want to make more informed decisions. In this presentation, I will present a behavioral decision research approach towards developing effective communications.

The PI has provided workshops for public health practitioners, weather forecasters, climate scientists and policy makers from different countries on how to communicate with non-expert audiences. These workshops aim to help experts to understand that non-experts do not think and talk like non-experts, and therefore have different communication needs than experts might believe. Not only do communications with non-expert audiences require the avoidance of expert jargon, but they also require a focus on topics that align with non-experts' beliefs and concerns. Specifically, experts communicating about heat waves to UK audiences should be aware that many people in the UK respond positively to the prospect of increasing temperatures, which reduces their concerns about heat-related hazards and their willingness to implement heat protection behaviours. Our project website at the University of Leeds has made materials available on how to effectively communicate (http://lubswww.leeds.ac.uk/cdr/projects/understanding-public-perceptions-of-and-responses-to-heat-waves-a-behavioural-decision-research-approach/). The PI has also joined expert panels at the Council of the Canadian Academies and the US National Academy of Sciences, so as to produce publicly available and easily accessible reports on how to communicate with non-expert audiences. Furthermore, the PI also has given media interviews in different countries, which have reached non-expert audiences with advice on how to protect against heat waves.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8C04FDC7-D0C4-43DB-8EDB-5638BD823BB3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Heat waves cause deaths, hospitalizations and discomfort. Although heat waves are rare in the UK, they are projected to become more common as a result of climate change. The goal of our project was therefore to understand public perceptions and preparedness for heat waves in the UK. We report on three main findings: 
Finding 1: In a national survey, we found that UK residents perceived the frequency of hot weather to have decreased over the course of their lifetime. Perhaps as a result, their climate change concerns were more strongly driven by their perceptions of increases in wet weather over the course of their lifetime.
Finding 2: In a UK-wide survey, we found that heat protection warnings were heard by 50% of participants during the 2013 UK heat wave. Hearing heat protection warnings about impending heat increased the perceived effectiveness of heat protection behaviors (such as staying in the shade, and drinking plenty of water). However, it also evoked positive feelings about heat, which undermined people's willingness to implement heat protection behaviors. 
Finding 3: In a UK-wide survey-based experiment, we found that public preparedness for heat waves could be improved by invoking unpleasant experiences with hot weather (as compared to traditional messages that remind people about their experiences with hot weather).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings are important for organisations such as the National Health Service (NHS) and Public Health England (PHE), which design communications to improve public heat protection. Follow-up work will test insights relevant to public responses to other extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts and snow. Ultimately, we aim to inform communications that promote public preparedness and resilience in the face of extreme weather.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>94EE6B70-D9B3-44EA-A2C4-C41208859D15</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://lubswww.leeds.ac.uk/cdr/responses-to-heatwaves/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment.
