Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/L000245/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The D2E project is a highly successful, STFC-funded programme delivering high quality astronomy education resources in the form of meteorite loan boxes, online lesson plans and an online asteroid/comet impact simulator (available in 8 languages). The loan scheme is currently run from Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales (AC-NMW) in Cardiff, from where it reaches ~5,000 students/yr (ages 10-16) and ~3,000 general public/yr through outreach - figures have been fairly constant since the D2E scheme started in mid-2007. Specific events, targeted at hard-to-reach audiences engage significant numbers annually (e.g. Beddgelert meteorite festival, N. Wales, Sept. 2009 to mark the 60th anniversary of the fall). We also made good use of national initiatives such as the BBC Stargazing Live in January 2011, 2012 and again in 2013 when D2E loan boxes were used extensively to support Stargazing Live programmes via outreach events at AC-NMW (National Museum Cardiff) and across Wales reaching c. 5,000 people during that week. We would like to extend this successful formula, and cascade our experience to new partners. By providing additional loan boxes, and teaching and management resources, we will facilitate the creation of two new loan hubs for D2E resources in Scotland and Northern Ireland, providing these countries with national centres for the scheme. These two hubs were selected as they have comparable national identities and organisations to Wales, and are run by the respective ESERO-UK Space Ambassadors (Tom Mason, Dan Hillier). Our experience in providing a national service in a small nation is of particular relevance, as is that of reaching geographically isolated and hard-to-reach communities. Part of our hard-to-reach programme includes provision of educational materials in a bilingual format, something not typically delivered by other science pubic awareness projects. For Scotland and NI, we will work with the hubs to produce Scots/Irish Gaelic versions of the key educational resource materials. We will share our gained experience with our partners, enabling them to be well equipped and supported to run their own schemes, and work effectively with STFC researchers. Crucially, it will extend the reach of the project beyond the current regions of Wales to schools/museums who have expressed an interest (i.e. AC-NMW sent loan boxes to Edinburgh, Exeter, Bristol and Salisbury in 2012). Armagh Planetarium helps to disseminate information on STFC-funded research carried out at the Armagh Observatory, such as the newly discovered populations of small satellites orbiting the giant planets, and the processes by which comets decay into meteoroid streams, but do not currently hold handling collections. This project will therefore not only provide much needed resources for public engagement at the Planetarium, but also a way of engaging audiences throughout Northern Ireland who may not be able to visit the Planetarium themselves. The Royal Observatory Edinburgh visitor centre highlights a broad range of STFC-funded research, and in particular the work of the Astronomy Technology Centre (ATC). New mini meteorite loan kits produced for ROE will also support the work of Dark Skies partners in Scotland. We wish to develop further our programme of hard-to-reach audience by evaluating how we might interface with national agendas such as the Child Poverty Strategy for Wales. This will be trialed initially in Wales and then evaluated to establish if a similar approach is appropriate for the two new hub areas. We have evaluated and concluded that potential risks to the project on a practical level these are low. The production of the educational materials is based on a well developed process for curriculum analysis, developing lesson plans, and identifying appropriate teachers' materials. There is therefore a clear mechanism in place to ensure the delivery of resources to the centres within the first 9 months of the project.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>50000</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Museums Northern Ireland</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Ulster Museum</gtr:department><gtr:description>Down2Earth Northern Ireland</gtr:description><gtr:id>747F8648-08B3-4E13-9758-BFCB67E20957</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Main meteorite loan boxes

The aim is to engage and inspire those attending in what meteorites can inform us about our own planet and formation of the solar system and raise awareness of the various field of science that support research in this area. They commonly serve to promote the loan collection to schools and membership of relevant enthusiast science societies.

The events cover a range of formats. Most common is informal displays of the loan material and supporting resources (such as a demonstration of the Impact Calculator), some of these were promoted under the BBC &amp;quot;stargazing' banner, BAS Science Week, cont events with Astronomical Societies (Cardiff, Swansea, Usk). or to support Dark Skies events. Many of these events attract large numbers and are viewed mainly as 'family' events although pitched to appeal to a wide age and knowledge range. In Wakes some of these events have been held across three of the eight Museum sites.
The total number of people attending and engaging with these materials is approximately 34,000 over the period of the grant. The main objectives of these events are (i) to raise awareness of meteorites and the role they play in informing about planetary geology, scientific research in this area and astronomy (ii) to engage in discussion with parents and children (particularly KS2-3) in a on-curriculum environment about careers in science. We have found that mothers (of both boys and girls), in particular, are keen to certain facts about what is required to enter a career in this area, (iii) to promote the loan collection to teachers, or to pupils to make information back to their schools.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Loan of Down2Earth resources</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13BD7F61-86A4-444F-A4E2-56A16D2E3C18</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Resources lent to Cardiff University for Mars Day events with Campus First audiences (KS3 priority pupils from Objective One areas)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://education.down2earth.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Loan of Down2Eath loan rsources to SAIL (Swansea Universiy)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>445F5CE4-862C-460C-9C25-1D67763C7AFE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop to engage hard to reach groups with physics and maths-based activities to promote continued study.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://education.down2earth.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Summary of activities  for KS2 pupils (loans and events) - all partners</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0472FEC-7587-4786-85E0-65A739837582</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Loan of Down2Earth large meteorite boxes (3 themes plus small 'lunch boxes') to schools plus events (67 separate events) delivered by the three partners Royal Observatory Edinburgh, Ulster Museum, National Museum wales &amp;amp; Faulkes Telescope Project.

The educational resources and facilitated access to resources (face-to-face and on-line learning resources) have been used by the groups indicated in the objectives, KS2-5 pupils, families, general public and teachers. We have acceded our original target audience of 30,000 but reaching over 64,000 people. This includes a far higher general public and family component, but does reach the planned groups in the proportions predicted. Teachers have accessed the materials though the web site and the loan materials through training sessions and then loans. The other groups have accessed the materials through formal and informal educational sessions. We have also promoted access to priority groups (socially disadvantaged and special education needs groups).
The impact of the project will be on-going as a prime aim of it was the development of a legacy resource in the three centre (Cardiff, Edinburgh and Belfast). We will continue to record the audience figures and documents revisions. A significant impact of the resources, over and above providing a resource to engage and stimulate the public, is that it has helped us and our partners to form other partnerships to deliver aspects of planetary geology and space science. We feel the outcomes of this project has indicated that there is a growing appetite for planetary science and this is a valuable tool for engaging KS2/3 pupils and parents is discussion a about careers in science.

The continued facilitated use of the materials at a wide range of events and actives continues to promote use of the Loan Collection. Thee will come a point shortly where the esoucs will require some refreshing to maintain their impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>88E3CE5A-0FA4-4B98-8E79-D54BA89D132D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>We have produced a visually appealing and exciting Impact Calculator, based on the same parameters as the successful Earth Impact Effects Program by Robert Marcus, H.

The results are displayed both mathematically (allowing them to be used in science lessons) but also visually (via Google Maps and satellite imagery), and the calculator has been used with age groups ranging from KS2 to adult learners (via workshops at LEARN, the adult education department at Cardiff University).</gtr:description><gtr:id>B3D3E513-5142-4A3F-92A6-98E23337D3AB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talks and a poster on the D2E project were delivered by Paul Roche, Sarah Roberts and Edward Gomez at the &amp;quot;dotcom Astronomy: networked astronomy and the new media&amp;quot; conference (Cardiff Uni, Sept. 2008).

Information about the project has also been shared with other science communicators through the British Science Association, Institute of Physics, Association of Science Educators, Science Alliance Cymru, the STEM Ambassadors programme, Techniquest, British Geological Survey, Earth Science Teachers Association annual conference, Earth Science Education Forum Cymru and BBC Wales.

We have developed new meteorite loan materials for partners in Scotland and Northern Ireland and also developed a new small loan box scheme for use by Dark Skies staff both in South Wales, Northern Ireland (Ulster Museum) and Scotland (Royal Observatory Edinburgh). The existing materials are supported by new learning resources and are made more accessible via a revamped website http://education.down2earth.eu, and a mobile app to access the meteorite impact calculator. 
This grant has delivered outcomes in collaboration with two new partners. The ROE partnership has developed extremely well and we have also made good links with the IOP in Scotland. We experience some logistical issues with our Northern Ireland partnership but with STFC approval and the support of the STFC mentor we have resolved these satisfactorily and now have an establish partnership with Ulster Museum. 
During this project we have developed the smaller meteorite 'lunch boxes', originally designed for use by Dark Skies champions, but have been found to be an attractive resource to a wider audience from primary school science, to longer term borrowers who act as local 'hubs' for the resources. 
We have achieved our original objectives by :
(i) Updating the on-line resources and developing new resources for the Moon and Mars boxes
(ii) Developing an app to access the meteorite impact calculator to allow simulation and modelling of a bolide hitting Earth.
(iii) Extending the impact of the loan collection to Northern Ireland and Scotland.
(iv) Expanding our previous audience base to include those within specific national policies, such as socially deprived groups and those with special educational needs. We have delivered this through 15 specialist events reaching an audience of 595.
(v) Achieving our projected audience figures of 30,000 people, comprising 3,000 KS2 pupils, 15,000 KS3/4 pupils, 3,000 KS5 pupils, 6,000 general public and family groups. We have significantly exceeded this figure through holding 267 events and loans, reaching a total audience of 64,000 people. An exception to this was with teachers, where we provided 31 training events involving 1,437 teachers. Audiences for each group are listed in the engagement section. Engagement with the general public and family groups far exceeded out target, through attendance at science fairs, festivals and open days. 
There is a demonstrable demand for meteorite-related educational material appropriate to be differentiated to a wide range of audiences. The project continues post end of project to deliver high quality material to a wide educational and asocial range of audiences .

As a result of growing awareness of our project we have been approached by a learned society (biological) to advise them in the development of a similar loan scheme and educational resources. 

We aim to share and communicate our resources with those developing the new Space Science module of the WGEC Geology GCSE. We hope this will ensure that the relevance of the Down2Earth (D2E) materials is maintained and can support delivery of this part of the syllabus. We will do the same to support relevant sections of the Space Science module of the curriculum in Northern Ireland. 

We have also reappraised the value of the Down2Earth meteorite resources in the teaching of special educational needs groups, in collaboration with a SEN specialist. We feel this will form the basis of a new partnership and that this is an area where we can develop the resources further. 

Where possible we will publish and promote the resources and the approach we have taken in relevant magazines and journals.

Methodology for the content and display of the loan material has already been od use in informing the redevelopment of the STFC Lunar Loan collection (2016/17)</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9404F2DF-7C6E-41B7-9AFA-3B576374FB8D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://education.down2earth.eu</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/L000245/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6E910789-6B8D-4B73-B5B0-F3156942B558</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Geosciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>859194A3-8EE1-41D7-90C5-DA2999B93E8E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Earth Resources</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>401A9A9F-83DF-48FD-B108-C4CC7FB7572C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Tectonic Processes</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
