Now, the Coalition Government is making a sustained attempt to reform 'arm's length bodies' that shape, make and deliver public policy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The reform raises important issues for democratic accountability, efficiency and organisation in the British state. These are especially important in the context of current economic, financial and policy challenges, deficit reduction and the ambition to shift greater responsibility for public provision to citizens and voluntary organisations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research asks:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Why have arm's length bodies been so durable?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;Why is reform now possible?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How is the durability and reform of arm's length bodies affected by a climate of austerity?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What are the consequences of reforming arm's length bodies for ministers, Parliament, civil servants and others?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How can the delegation of executive or advisory authority to independent bodies be designed?&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Our research will track the implementation of the Coalition Government's reform and compare this with developments internationally. It will consider the legal, constitutional and administrative issues involved, but also the broader politics involved in reshaping and shrinking the state.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will have an impact that combines breadth and depth and which engages both specialists and the public. 

Practitioner Impact: The project is closely connected to the policy community, in particular through the Public Chairs Forum, Institute for Government, Local Government Information Unit, Association of Chief Executives, and the Public Administration Select Committee in the House of Commons. Members of the project team will offer talks at events hosted by specific policy beneficiaries, evidence to investigations/inquiries they undertake, and data, advice and input into their policy reports. Policy partners will act as intermediaries, facilitating knowledge exchange between the researchers and more diffuse audiences, including MPs, civil servants, and interest groups. Annual policy reports produced in cooperation with the policy partners will document and comment on progress in reform of arm's length bodies. Towards the end of the research a number of small roundtable events will be arranged on a range of topics, hosted by the Institute for Government, in order to disseminate and explain the implications of this study. Policy outputs will be directed at professional journals (Skelcher has written for such journals on basis previous ESRC research).

Public Impact: The researchers, with assistance of their universities' media teams, will write and place a number of articles in popular magazines and newspapers. Flinders has written for The Times and The Guardian on the challenges of public policy reform and he has also written and presented programmes for BBC Radio 4. The existing relationships will be utilised in order to promote this research far beyond the normal boundaries and reach out to a new audience. The findings of Flinders' last ESRC grant (Patronage, Governance and Reform) is now the topic of a proposal that is being considered by the BBC in the current commissioning round. This will be supported by the documents and papers that will be available from the project website and also through the lectures and seminars that members of the project team will offer to a range of organisations. 

UK Social Science Research Base Impact: The project will host capacity building workshops for the social science community (see 'academic beneficiaries' section). This project will also facilitate the development and training of four new entrants to the social science community. The two post-docs and two attached doctoral researchers will form part of a tight, ambitious and internationally-oriented research team that is willing to challenge established assumptions and reach out to new audiences. The aim would be to develop the post-docs in terms of their professional skills and academic knowledge so that by the end of the project they would be in a position to launch self-standing research careers. The aim with the doctoral students would not simply be to produce completed PhDs, but to produce individuals with a breadth of knowledge that allows them to span a range of theories, methods and approaches while also forging relationships between academe and the practical world of day-to-day public administration.

Teaching Impact: This application is primarily aimed at making a distinctive contribution to knowledge and this will, in turn, allow the project to make a significant contribution in terms of teaching. Short mini-lectures on the project will be posted on youtube/project website by the project team, a series of accessible position papers and documents will be produced and disseminated through the website, and the project will support the Political Studies Association's new teaching scheme for colleges and schools. Members of the project team (specifically the post-docs) would also be directed to submit teaching related publications to a range of magazines and journals like Politics and Insight.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-05-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>655703</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Just one in ten quangos has been abolished despite the Coalition's promise to wield the axe</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8496B3AA-182F-4481-B601-8BAA9337FEDC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Newspaper coverage of the projects first annual report

The Civil Service Reform Plan (June 2012) raised a host of questions not just about the future of the civil service but also about the future of the state, the public's expectations and the delivery of accountable public services. Our main points are:

a. The hub model of government proposed by the Civil Service Reform Plan potentially involves five types of reform: delegation, floating-off, contracting-out/joint ventures, offloading, and shared services.

b. Few of the more radical options were taken during the Public Bodies reform review.

c. The five types of reform present feasibility challenges for government.

d. There is a tension between the centrifugal forces underlying the civil service reform plan's ambition for improved and more efficient delivery, and the centripetal forces of improved accountability that in part motivated the public bodies review.

e. Careful consideration of the sponsorship relationship linking ministers and delivery bodies is necessary to ensure that reform does not lead to an increasingly opaque and fragmented institutional architecture of ever more sophisticated delivery structures.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmpubadm/writev/csr/csr.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Chairs' Forum Seminar on Alternative Models of Service Delivery</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DC991584-CE6A-4A6E-A8E0-80F5A8E28F4E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Katherine Tonkiss participated in a seminar discussion with Public Chairs and the Minister for Civil Society (Nick Hurd MP).

Our evidence concentrates on the organisational rather than the financial aspects of the Committee's inquiry, drawing on our analysis of the Coalition government's public bodies and NHS reform process.1 We focus on pre-legislative action by government in relation to the proposed closure of the Audit Commission and the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), and proposed reform of NHS commissioning from Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) to GP-led Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). These cases have been selected because (a) they have high political salience for the Coalition government, (b) the proposed reforms have far-reaching implications on the bodies' existence, and (c) they exhibit significant pre-legislative reform activity.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Accountability of the Civil Service</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17E887A0-0CEC-4743-9522-919D7518C720</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Inquiry by the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral evidence to the House of Commons Political and Constitutional Reform Committee</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0140B182-22E3-45B5-BCD8-7519C5F30E41</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of the inquiry into 'Do we need a constitutional convention for the United Kingdom?</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>This research into the reform of public bodies by the 2010 Coalition government was co-produced with key stakeholders (notably the Cabinet Office, Public Chairs Forum and Institute for Government). This enabled our research to be infused into the centre of the policy-making process in Whitehall and Westminster. 

Our project's impact on policy and practice audiences was achieved through various mechanisms.

We enhanced stakeholders understanding of the process and outcomes of the reform by delivering research-based presentations to seminars organized by our policy partners. These were attended by civil servants involved in public body reform as well as chairs, board members and senior managers from individual public bodies. Our presentations offered an independent view of the reforms, stimulating debate amongst stakeholders and identification of potential developments. This independent view - as a 'critical friend' - has been central to our ability to retain engagement with key stakeholders and influence the development of policy and practice. 

We helped shape specific developments in the reform and management of public bodies by undertaking specially commissioned studies to provide in-depth analysis of topics of interest to our partners. These included analyses of the sponsorship arrangements between ministries and public bodies, the effects of the new financial control framework, triennial reviews, and the future role of the Public Chairs Forum. By looking across Whitehall, some studies were able to isolate 'best practice' that could be disseminated more widely, for example in relation to the integration of sponsorship arrangements into a central unit within a ministry or the development of more proportionate forms of triennial review. 

We informed and influenced the debate within Westminster about ministerial accountability for public bodies. We submitted research-based evidence to parliamentary enquiries, including those initiated by the (then) House of Commons Select Committee on Public Administration and the House of Lords Committee on the Constitution, as well as the National Audit Office study of the financial effects of public body reform. The culmination was the appointment of Prof. Flinders, a member of the research team, as special adviser for the Public Administration Committee's inquiry into the accountability of public bodies in 2014. The Public Administration Committee made considerable use of the team's written and oral evidence in its analysis and recommendations to Government. 

Finally, we informed the wider debate about and public understanding of 'quangos'. We wrote numerous Blogs and published newspaper articles. Our project web site contained regular updates on the reform process. We also organized an event for 6th form politics students from 4 schools, using the 'Legislate' game designed by the Parliamentary Solicitor's Office which models the legislative process from inception to implementation. A local MP and civil servants involved in public body legislation also contributed to the day. The impact here was the improved understanding and critical analysis of the UK's legislative process by young people reaching voting age. The team also contributed to a similar event organized by the Cabinet Office for schools in London as part of Parliament Week.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>465EC014-0B56-4D29-999B-AC5C36048014</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We analysed the 2010-2015 Coalition government's reform of 'quangos' - officially, 'public bodies' operating at arm's length to ministers. The Public Bodies Reform programme was the most extensive attempt to restructure arm's-length bodies in a generation. It sought to increase efficiency and accountability. Cost reduction was achieved, some &amp;pound;2.5 billion over the course of the 2010-2015 Parliament, but largely achieved through abolition and merging of the smaller organisations and reclassifying larger ones. On accountability, the government reinstated the annual Public Bodies directory and increased the types of bodies it included. However accountability was not increased in a fundamental or systematic manner. Reinforcing the convention of individual ministerial responsibility fails to accommodate the complexity of the arm's length body landscape. 

A significant theoretical contribution was to develop the idea of 'meta-governance' (i.e. the governance of governance) and apply this to the problem of managing the tension between the centrifugal pressure for increased ministerial accountable in the Public Bodies Reform policy and the centripetal force for outsourcing which is driven by the Cabinet Office and HM Treasury. It revealed that Government lacks an overall approach to thinking about the management and accountability issues arising from the different forms of arm's length relationships and countervailing pressures. 

We contributed new insights on agency reform in two ways. First, we revisited Hood's influential work, The politics of quangocide. Using theoretical innovation and fresh empirical research, we found that the Coalition had not simply engaged in quangocide, but had adopted a dual-track strategy based upon 'bureau-shuffling' and strengthening internal control. This has significant international and comparative relevance due to the manner in which these findings resonate with broader 'post New Public Management' narratives of state restructuring. Secondly, we challenge conventional explanations of agency survival during administrative reform by showing that agencies are active participants. We identify three archetypical defence strategies-technical expert, network node, and marginal adaptor-and argue that coding agency strategies alongside structural analysis can help better explain reform outcomes.

Analysis of the UK's mass reorganisation has enabled us to develop a new theory of agency reform that overcomes the limitations of the existing literature, much of which is inspired by the US case and focuses on the binary decision of whether or not to terminate an agency. We constructed a novel data set and show that high level choices regarding whether or not to remove agency independence then lead to lower level choices about agency organisation and the way in which its functions should be allocated. Each of these choices has important consequences for political accountability. 

Finally, this project has been able to deliver greater understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of co-production as a methodological approach in the social sciences. The 'politics of co-production' has emerged as an unexpected but valuable contribution of the project with specific insights and lessons for ESRC funded scholars in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Reform of semi-independent agencies is a feature across the public service internationally.
