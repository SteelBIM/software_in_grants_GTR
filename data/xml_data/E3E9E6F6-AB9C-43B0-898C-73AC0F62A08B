&lt;p>The work takes as its starting point the view that ?passive dissemination? of research results will rarely be sufficient to have an impact in schools. It will investigate more effective ways to improve the impact and uptake of educational technology in the classroom, such as supporting dialogue and interactions between research users, producers and intermediaries. It will examine existing evidence-based technologies which have and have not been successfully scaled up, in order to identify the key levers for achieving impact at a national level. The work will directly inform the scale up and dissemination of projects from EEF's dedicated digital technology funding round.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Drawing on the existing work on research impact and educational technology funded by the ESRC and EEF, this placement provides an excellent opportunity to investigate an understudied but critically important area of 'knowledge mobilisation', which has wider relevance for practitioners, grant-makers and policy-makers in education and other areas of social policy.

By investigating different ways of mobilising knowledge, and investigating attitudes towards the use of evidence, the aim is to increase the use of high-quality research to inform decision-making at all levels. This strategy will involve a dual approach: engaging directly with the practitioner base (bottom up) and at the same time working with wider educational stakeholders to build capacity for evidence-based reform (top down).

Overall, the project has the potential to impact on the following groups:

 - UK national and international policy makers
 - Local authority and academy chains 
 - Governing bodies
 - Head teachers and school management teams
 - Teachers
 - Parents
 - Children</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>179783</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Government of the UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department for Education (DfE)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Partnership with the Department for Education and Greater London Authority to investigate 'Research Use in Schools'</gtr:description><gtr:id>A456D091-BE73-4033-B4B6-D3E5274E4034</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The projects are all ongoing so there is no direct impact yet.

This work is being managed by the EEF and evaluated independently. This funding emerged as a result of DfE's interest in evidence-informed teaching as a policy area, which had begun earlier in the year with Ben Goldacre's analytical review, Building Evidence into Education. 

EEF staff (including Jonathan Sharples, on ESRC-funded secondment) have overseen the conceptualisation of the round, the selection of projects, the content and scope of the projects and the design of the evaluations. The aim of the 'Research Use in Schools' round is to gather more empirical evidence around 'what works' in supporting schools engagement with evidence and, following on from this, the impact on pupil's attainment. Although the focus is on the instrumental use of research evidence, we are also interested in how research influences the culture, dispositions and processes within the school (eg school improvement processes, professional development). 

A funding round opened in January 2014 for six weeks. The guidance notes for applicants called for three types of projects:

1. Communicating research ('Push') - How can research organisations and others effectively communicate their findings and engage with schools? 
2. The research informed school ('Pull') - How can schools overcome the barriers to using research well?
3. Intermediaries, brokers and networks ('Linkage') - How can brokers and mediators help schools find and use evidence-based approaches?

This sits in the context of an education sector that is increasingly interested in evidence-based policy and practice. 

The EEF/ESRC secondment has involved five broad types of activity:
? Devising and overseeing a research portfolio on Knowledge Mobilisation (KM).
? Applying that learning, and other KM research, to develop EEF's scale up strategy (e.g. scale up campaigns)
? Brokering and communicating research 
? Influencing policy (e.g. advising government on evidence-based policy and practice) 
? Sharing our learning across different sectors and internationally, including the What Works Network.

There have been four main outputs:

1. DfE/EEF 'Research Use in Schools' funding round 

A themed round of EEF projects, rigorously evaluating current approaches to mobilising knowledge with schools. Comprised of five research projects investigating different ways of encouraging schools to engage with, and use, research to improve practice, across three broad types of KM activity:
a) communicating and disseminating research ('push'), 
b) building capacity and expertise within schools to use research ('pull') 
c) the role of intermediaries and brokers in linking research and practice ('linkage'). 

The evaluations includes three Randomised Controlled Trials, including one the largest recruited RCTs in education worldwide (~780 schools). Most of these projects are due to report in 2017.

2. Development of the 'Research Use in Schools' survey and outcome measures

A methods development project to create a quantifiable measure of research engagement, to be used within the evaluations of the Research Use in Schools projects. The survey instrument adopts several novel approaches to investigating teachers' use of research, including exploring teacher's objective knowledge of research evidence (as well as self-reported perceptions of research engagement) and the use of factor analysis to quantify and identify trends in the data. 

As far as we are aware it is the first standardised, quantified measure of research engagement developed internationally in education. It is currently being adapted for use in other fields, including by other What Works Centres.

3. National baseline survey of schools' use of research

The Research Use in Schools survey has been used to capture a baseline assessment of teachers' use of research evidence. A sample of 500 teachers, middle leaders and school leaders were surveyed in Autumn 2014, providing an insight on current levels of teacher research engagement and research knowledge.

The findings suggest that academic research has only a small to moderate influence on decision making relative to other sources, despite teachers generally reporting a positive disposition towards research. Additionally, it suggests this positive disposition towards research, and perceptions of research engagement, are not necessarily transferring into an increased conceptual understanding of research knowledge.

4. Development and evaluation of EEF scale-up campaigns

The current research around KM and implementation has been used to develop, and test, the scale-up strategy for the EEF, focused on multi-stranded 'campaigns'. Campaigns are specific and directive activities that address practical issues in schools by scaling up evidence-based approaches. 

Underpinning each campaign is clear and actionable guidance (i.e. similar to NICE guidelines), plus supporting resources to help schools act on the evidence. This guidance is disseminated and implemented using a range of approaches, tailored for each campaign: e.g. sector-led implementation, programme funding, incentive payments, policy influence. 

EEF's first campaign focused on Making best use of Teaching Assistants. &amp;pound;5m has been directed to South and West Yorkshire, where we are working the majority of primary schools in the regions to implement the guidance. Data from the 2015 NFER Omnibus survey suggests 70% of headteachers in England are aware of the guidance report. 

The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Sheffield Hallam University are currently evaluating the TA campaign, which will provide information on the viability and impact of the campaigns model, with relevance for WWCs interested in using evidence at scale (due to report Autumn 2017).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Although the work is focused on the use of research in education it is has cross-sector relevance. Both the research (the 'learning) and the strategy (the 'doing') are increasingly recognised, both nationally and internationally, as important in terms of scale, novelty and significance. 

The baseline survey results have been a key evidence source for the government Department for Education's evaluation of 'evidence-based teaching' policy. 

The survey is currently being adapted for use in other fields, and could be adapted for use across the What Works Network. 

The work has been referenced by the DfE, DfID, Cabinet Office and What Works Network in the UK, the OECD, EU Commission, What Works Clearinghouse, WT Grant Foundation internationally, as well as the KM research community.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>07321B6E-1D34-4A1C-9A48-56D9E0110880</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advising the London Schools Excellence Fund on Evaluation and Knowledge Mobilisation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6A069AFE-2294-4D63-9957-3C221CA4554C</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Teach First research advisory group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>148C0706-323D-4D21-B5EC-64BD31F7E8F0</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Steering group for the 'Evidence-informed Policy and Practice in Education in Europe' (EIPPEE) network</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6E9C2AE0-B18C-4DB1-AF35-6B055BA0FCA5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.eippee.eu/cms/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advising the Danish government on a systematic review on the effective use of research evidence in schools.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA3223A5-60BF-49A9-A098-6B04052BDC20</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Helping to devise the UK government's standards for teacher professional development</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>341C473A-28BB-4EF3-BCA2-3CD5825F8EC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The group has produced a national set of standards for teacher professional development and learning, which will apply to all English schools.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/teachers-professional-development-expert-group</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>70% of Headteachers, nationally, are aware of the Making Best Use of Teaching Assistants guidance report, with 40% reporting either to have read the report or acted on it (2015 NFER Omnibus data).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2F6BDF21-1465-4E02-81DF-53B532184294</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/campaigns/making-best-use-of-teaching-assistants/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Making best use of Teaching Assistants campaign used as a case study for HM Treasury and No.10</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9985172F-1895-4776-BE40-E80AEA0C32A9</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Royal College of Teaching advisory group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>75D1C7B8-FDE7-4AD5-AA7F-F12B3391D21D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advising the Department for Education (DfE) on an evaluation of progress towards 'evidence-based teaching'</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>74997B32-EC84-437B-BE90-1A9EC1E34428</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Shaping government policy on evidence-based reform -

The survey instrument adopts a number of novel approaches to investigating teachers' use of research, including exploring teacher's objective knowledge of research evidence (as well as self-reported perceptions of research engagement) and the use of factor analysis to quantify, and identify trends in, the data. 
As far as we are aware it is the first standardised, quantified measure of research engagement developed internationally in education. It is currently being adapted for use in other fields, and could be adapted for use across the What Works Network.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F0716D24-A77B-460F-A597-A505A7EF0B78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The tool has been adapted for use in other contexts, including an early years research project and as a national baseline assessment of research use in Australia.
