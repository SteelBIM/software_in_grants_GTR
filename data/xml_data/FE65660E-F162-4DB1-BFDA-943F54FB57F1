Clinical manifestations include chronic and acute pain, and strokes. The known number of children with SCD will increase from the current estimate of 5,000 over the next decade as all newborn infants and most pregnant mothers will be screened for SCD.&amp;nbsp; However, the impact of sickle cell on the educational experiences of young people is an under-researched area.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to map the extent and content of educational policies on SCD at local authority and school level; to map the range and frequency of key factors reported to affect the educational experiences of those living with SCD; to describe the perceptions held by those living with SCD of their educational experiences and to develop a user-led educational policy framework for SCD. This work will be conducted by means of an internet survey of existing educational policies; a survey of local education authorities and of pupils with SCD; depth interviews with pupils with SCD and detailed case studies of pupils with SCD.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>226461</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Newham Sickle Cell Centre_2007</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>872DEE13-1212-45E1-B8B1-753238386998</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To give a talk on sickle cell in schools based on the review of the literature

I have been copied in to an email requesting comments on draft proposals for commissioning of haemoglobinopathies. The one factor I can see missing is any requirement to address school health for young people with sickle cell disease (SCD). Young people spend half their lives as children in school so care outside hospital to a large extent means care at school. Our research suggested that children with sickle cell are regularly made ill unnecessarily by schools falling to have any policies (and often any notion) of what they should be doing to keep young people with sickle cell well at school. It is clear that children with SCD are becoming ill and having expensive hospital treatment (1) because teachers will not permit drinking of water in class (or will not permit toilet breaks which then make the young person reluctant to drink water), (2) because 75% of schools with a child with SCD have no arrangements for giving painkillers to children with SCD, or (3) because PE teacher enforce unsuitable exercise making the young person ill. Less than half of pupils (43%) with SCD have an individual health care plan as suggested by guidance on managing health conditions at school. Our research also strongly suggested that these issues are NOT related to teacher awareness of SCD and so are NOT solved simply by greater awareness for teachers. 

The findings may be summarised as follows: Young people with SCD reported missing an average of 16 school days per year. However, the intermittent nature of the absences (each period of absence from school being, typically, of 2-3 days duration, meant statutory requirements on local authorities to make special provisions were not applied. The majority of young people with SCD felt they were not helped to catch up the education they missed. Over 80% felt they were helped to catch up less than half of what they missed, 20% felt they were not helped to catch up any of what was missed, and only 5% reported they were helped to catch up all education missed. Half the children reported not being allowed to use the toilet when needed and not being allowed water in class (adequate hydration being a key preventive measure to reduce incidences of illness); a third reported being made to take unsuitable exercise (another potential trigger to unnecessary episodes of illness) and being called lazy when tired from the severe anaemia that characterises SCD. There was no statistical association between whether or not teachers/peers knew the young person had SCD ad whether or not the young person reported negative school experiences. Raising awareness is therefore insufficient for effecting change. A change in wider school environments is required so that young people with SCD are supported irrespective of whether they foreground or play down their disabled identity. 

We (rightly) spend a great deal of public money on newborn screening and Transcranial Doppler Screening in order that young people with SCD reach age 5 as healthy as possible and then all these advances are thrown away because school health, and in particular preventive measures in relation to health at school, are the poorest of poor relations when considering health priorities. With this in mind, and on the basis of the only national study of the health of young people with SCD at school, I would suggest the following:


1) Directors of Public Health be required to notify annually to the Head of Children and Young Person's Services the numbers of people with SCD born in each school year cohort. In this way the relevant local authority should be made aware of the level of need within the education authority.
2) The School Nursing Service in conjunction with the local specialist sickle cell/thalassaemia nurses is required to audit the existence and annual maintenance of Individual Health Care Plans for young people with SCD at school.
3) The School Nursing Service in conjunction with the local specialist sickle cell/thalassaemia nurses is required to audit the existence and annual maintenance of a school policy on sickle cell and thalassaemia. A free-to-use example is enclosed. This policy guide is on the Department of Education web-site at http://www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/pastoralcare/b0013771/managing-medicines-in-schools 
4) The School Nursing Service in conjunction with the local specialist sickle cell/thalassaemia nurses is required to audit the existence and annual maintenance of arrangements for administration of painkillers for young people with SCD at school in cases where moderate painkillers and some rest would enable them to remain in school. We would not tolerate a child with asthma being denied its inhaler, or a child with diabetes its insulin. Why should school health be so crass as to be able to deny a child with sickle cell pain relief for mild to moderate pain that might enable them to remain included within the school environment?

I realise that the focus of the consultation is on clinical commissioning. However, unless the focus is broadened and important school health preventive interventions are specified then merely by dint of the age structure of communities having children with SCD, the number of people with SCD will rise to over 20,000 (360 babies a year x an anticipated average life expectancy in the future of 60 years for someone with SCD = 21,600) and the costs of treatment will increase accordingly. The fact that the commissioning is clincally focussed and focussed on acute care should not, in my view, exclude an initiative that will ultimately help to keep treatment costs closer to current levels by moderating the increase in demand caused by the increase in numbers, with the preventive measures suggested.


Submission of advice was acknowleged but it was stated that although school health intimately affected clinical costs that the narrow remot on provision of acute sevcies menat that the board could nottake account of comments. This was acknowldged as an issue.

The mother repored back:-

&amp;quot;I had a meeting at my daughter's school regarding my child's educational welfare as I had already had issues with it. There had initially been a &amp;quot;confrontation&amp;quot; about this matter for which I had refused to bow owing to the fact that my child &amp;quot;matters&amp;quot; to me. I got the feeling that the school had already formed an idea about what sort of parent I was. This is because they played into everything that I said and as I pulled out copies of your article to give them, they themselves recognised it and let it out that they had spent the past few days researching on sickle cell (knowing that this meeting was forthcoming) and had come across your publication. To this effect, the school has promised to put in place every available resource in place to support not just my daughter's schooling but also the family.

It has been used as the main evidence in an All Party Parliamentary Group report on sickle cell and thalassaemia at the House of Commons. It has informed the production of leaflets for use by teachers and peers in schools to help young people with sickle cell, leaflets produced by young people living with SCD: My Pupil has Sickle Cell Disease: What do I Need to Know? and My Friend has Sickle Cell Disease: What do I Need to Know? 

The project has influenced policy on managing young people with medical conditions in schools. A policy guide Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia: Health and Safety in Schools: A Guide to School Policy was adopted by the Department for Children, Schools and Families. In early 2011 it was placed on the Department for Education website for teachers supporting children with medical conditions in schools. It was removed in late 2013.

The project has supported the advocacy work of a number of stakeholders. The policy guide (using Creative Commons Copyright, making the guide an open education resource that is free to copy and to adapt) has specifically supported the work of individual mothers of young people with SCD, and sickle cell voluntary support groups in Wolverhampton, Sandwell, Birmingham, and London. It has supported the work of specialist nurses in Newham, Sheffield and Leicester, and the work of a consultant paediatrician in East London.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>588F62C3-A51B-46C1-A494-1F06C17A3887</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutput><gtr:description>A narrated Powerpoint Lecture, produced as an open education resource using Creative Commons Copyright CC-BY-SA , on the subject of this published article:

The project found that most local authorities did not know numbers of young people with SCD in their area. Less than half schools with a young person with SCD were complying with government guidance that all such children should have individual health care plans. Only two local authorities had specific had policies on SCD and most authorities referred to generic guidance on pupils with medical needs. However the current generic guidance does not address preventive health, and fails to challenge disability discrimination.The generic guidance covers providing medicines to pupils with medical conditions, but only one-quarter of young people with SCD reported having access to pain medication at school when needed. 

Young people with SCD miss considerable time from school, on average 16 days a year, a level that exceeds the 15 days beyond which schools and local authorities have a statutory duty to make alternative arrangements. However the episodic nature of the school absences, typically in short periods of 2-3 days, meant that a narrow interpretation of the guidance (15 days &amp;quot;in a row&amp;quot;) was being used. This leads to young people with SCD being unsupported.The majority of students with SCD reported that they are not helped to catch up their missed schooling. Half the children reported not being allowed to use the toilet when needed and not being allowed water in class; a third reported being made to take unsuitable exercise and being labelled lazy when tired from the severe anaemia associated with their SCD. Schools were therefore failing to take simple precautions that would enable young people with SCD to remain well at school. 

Whether or not teachers know that the student has SCD makes no significant difference to reported negative experiences at school. Most young people with SCD favour disclosure to teachers, because they hope teachers will know what actions to take if they become ill and will make allowances for school absences. Some disagreed, citing instances of attracting unwarranted attention or of experiencing disabling attitudes. Attitudes to disclosing to peers were ambivalent between acknowledging the reality of their sickle cell, and not wanting it to be a central part of their identity. A change in wider school environments is required so that young people with SCD are supported irrespective of whether or not they want to speak out about their sickle cell.

Young people with SCD are found to be regularly and awkwardly positioned between the demands of their doctors, who advised on how they could remain well through self-care and taking appropriate precautions, and the practices of the school with its emphases on routines and consistent attendance. Even where good practice is in evidence in schools, the school concerned tends to address just one aspect of sickle cell in isolation and this is not consolidated into comprehensive school policies. A model school policy has therefore been produced by the project (available at: www.sicklecelleducation.com).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The Guide to School Policy could be used by schools in implementing the 2014 Children and Families Act that requires governing bodies and schools to make provision for children with medical conditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6CAA715B-DE4E-4505-8523-53F31ACDB134</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sicklecelleducation.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All Party Parliamentary Group on Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia_Advice to Department for Education Civil Servant</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F75A3E55-7E3F-44C3-8A8C-406712C5813E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All Party Parliamentary Group on Sickle Cell_Advice_2009</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>94DB6AEE-5C52-435B-94BA-273F02AEEC40</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.dmu.ac.uk/documents/health-and-life-sciences-documents/sickle-cell/appgreportmarch2009.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>All Party Parliamentary Group Diabetes (Health Conditions at School Alliance)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E448929B-AAF7-4C2E-AB8D-1BF3EBD61D74</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://twitter.com/APPG_Diabetes/status/836996334993489922</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member House of Lords_Sickle Cell in Schools Policy Advice</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>62E5FBDE-3736-4878-9E97-80A28D1A83CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Response to a request from the Sickle Cell Society and Baroness Benjamin (a Sickle Cell Society Patron) for a briefing on sickle cell in schools to contribute to a House of Lords debate on the Children and Families Bill.
