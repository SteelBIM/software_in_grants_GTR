outcomes, such that understanding their origins is an urgent challenge. This proposal extends
the applicants' previous work on family influences on children's abilities to regulate their thoughts and behaviours in several ways: by focusing on the first two years of life; by examining effects of paternal as well as maternal influences; by integrating this cognitive perspective with the co-investigators' expertise in assessing individual differences at biological and social levels; and finally by adopting
a multi-site design that provides a stringent test of the generalisability of study findings. 

A sample of 400 expectant mothers and their partners (200 in the UK and 100 in the USA and
the Netherlands) will be recruited using an enriched sampling design to maximize the
participation of expectant parents showing low levels of well-being. Self-regulatory
skills will be assessed using validated experimental methods. We hope to examine the complex interplay between a range of social factors (e.g., quality of family relationships) cognitive factors (in both parents and infants) and biological factors (maternal and infant levels of the stress hormone cortisol) as predictors of infant adjustment and well-being.

A key strength of the study is its inclusion of fathers, as many basic questions regarding parental influences remain unanswered: For example are the relations between parental predictors and infant outcomes similar in nature and magnitude for fathers and mothers? 

Building on the rapid growth of studies that highlight variation in children's susceptibility to environmental influences, the proposed study will explore contrasts in the nature and magnitude of family predictors of infant adjustment that relate to characteristics of the infant (e.g., stress reactivity), the parent (e.g., parenting style) and the culture (e.g., level of societal support for individuals making the transition to parenthood).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We have already established contact with the Cambridgeshire Director of Midwifery Services and with one of the consultant Neonatologists at Addenbrookes Hospital to discuss ways of engaging with stakeholders from the very beginning of the study; as well as with government policymakers (e.g., Early Years Foundation Trust) to discuss ways of ensuring that the dissemination of findings reaches as wide a pool of practitioners and policymakers as possible. 

Key findings from the study that are likely to have social or economic implications include:
1) The importance of fathers' wellbeing, thoughts and behaviours towards their infants
2) Elucidating the relative importance of pre- and post-natal risk
3) Demonstrating social influences upon infants' early cognitive development
4) Identifying profiles associated with risky outcomes for infants

We expect beneficiaries to include those working with expectant parents (e.g., community midwives, health visitors), mental health professionals and educationalists working with the early years. Our discussions with stakeholders will focus on ensuring that benefits to these groups are maximised (e.g., sharing relevant findings, contributing to workshops and to the auditing of local services).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-04-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>584668</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Faculty of Education</gtr:department><gtr:description>Investigating conversational environments for toddlers exposed to parental postnatal depression</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F4A5A20-0135-4BAA-BD82-DDFEF75C2235</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Data collection still in progress</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Additional data collection and analyses and recruitment of at-risk sample via NICU</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Sharing study families to enable satellite study using talk pedometers</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Study families garden party</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E8863BBF-F70F-458D-BEA3-3AC59B9878B5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Annual garden party for the families taking part - a chance for them to meet each other and engage their toddlers in developmentally appropriate activities led by local musicians, librarians, entertainers.

Following on from the success of last year, this summer the team organised the second garden party for the participating families (6th August, 2016). The garden party provided a chance for the research team to say thank you to the families but also gave the parents an opportunity to meet other parents with toddlers the same age. Families had the chance to learn more about local services available to parents as they took part in a rhyme-time and music session. As well as enjoying music, lawn games and refreshments, the families also had a chance to provide feedback on how they have found taking part in the study so far by answering questions on the back of post-cards. Specifically, the team asked: &amp;quot;From taking part in this study, what have you learned about: you child? Yourself? Your partner?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What will be the best thing about your child turning 2?&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;What will be the biggest challenge(s) when they turn 2?&amp;quot; A newsletter summarising these answers was sent out to the parents after the party and will also help inform the next (fourth) phase of the study when the families will be visited when their first-born turns 2 years old.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Workshop to lauch Shenzhen University Department of Psychology (3 talks given)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7406CCF9-8F25-4B36-A6EB-4F5BE4601701</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The purpose of this meeting was to forge a supportive network for the new discipline (in China) of developmental psychology.

Following on from this, Dr Austin asked me to summarise the seminar and the discussion for all NICU and Rosie staff and so I wrote a piece entitled &amp;quot;Psychologist on the Wall&amp;quot; for the NICU newsletter &amp;quot;Neonatal Allsorts&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Garden Party - participant engagement</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8899B31F-6BFE-4702-BB8F-C1D2E74E4257</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The largest and most exciting knowledge exchange activity the team organised so far was the garden party for the participating families (22nd and 23rd August, 2015). The garden party provided a chance for the research team to say thank you to the families but also gave the expectant and new parents an opportunity to meet other new parents in the area. Families had the chance to learn more about local services available to new parents as they took part in a taster session of &amp;quot;rhyme-time&amp;quot;, provided by staff at Cambridge Central Library, and a &amp;quot;baby-yoga&amp;quot; class, provided by Birth Light. As well as enjoying music, lawn games and refreshments, the families also had a chance to learn more about the data collected as part of the prenatal wave of the study. Specifically, the team presented posters that focused on; (1) the cortisol analyses undertaken on the saliva samples couples had provided, (2) the content of their five minute speech samples, (3) expectant parent's prenatal worries and concerns and (4) the different ways in which parents had prepared for parenthood.

The participants also had a chance to provide feedback on how they have found taking part in the study so far by using stickers to indicate yes or no to several questions, such as &amp;quot;Did the prenatal interview stimulate an conversation between you and your partner?&amp;quot;. In addition to this, participants also had the chance to provide more open-ended feedback on the back of post-cards.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alumni event</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2018455C-6372-4FBF-A3A8-854231C92144</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This talk was part of a one-day workshop on 'New Families' - open to alumni of Newnham College, but also to PhD students from other colleges in the University.
