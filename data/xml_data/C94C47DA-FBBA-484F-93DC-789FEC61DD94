A scoping study of the available research on ex-colonial communities and the experience of two world wars</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J012211/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>During the First World War, tens of thousands of East Africans were drafted into a non-combatant Carrier Corps to support the British campaign against the Germans in Africa; by October 1917, almost 29,000 of them had died of 'disease or accident'. A Chinese Labour Corps of some 100,000 men drawn largely from the British colony of Weihai and an Egyptian Labour Corps, with over 55,000, were at the same time providing essential support to British forces on the Western Front and in the Middle East respectively. A South African Native Labour Corps provided some 70,000 personnel for service in both Africa and Europe, 616 of whom died when their ship, the Mendi, sank following a collision in the Channel on 21 February 1917. Many tens of thousands of Africans and hundreds of thousands of people from India served with the British forces in North Africa, Italy and Burma in the Second World War, when vast quantities of raw materials were also sent from West Africa to the UK. These facts are little known in Britain today.

Historians have traced continuities between the perception of the two World Wars by the peoples of the colonies of the British Empire (including the lived experiences of those who volunteered or were conscripted for service), the development of independence movements in those future nations and patterns of migration from them to the United Kingdom. Further work has also been done in the UK to explore the role played by awareness of this earlier history in dealing with notions of 'Britishness' and other issues both among the communities deriving from such migration and in the 'host' community. Continuing widespread lack of understanding of the colonies' participation in those conflicts nonetheless shows that there remains room for very much more work in this area. Such work will provide a better framework of historical perspective for the representation of these communities to others, and strengthen the communities' own perception of their heritage and identity.

The Imperial War Museum covers all aspects of conflicts in which Britain and the Empire/Commonwealth have been involved since 1914, and its collections include extensive holdings of personal reminiscences, artefacts and works of art, film and photography - a very considerable proportion of which documents the experience of colonial troops and the impacts that the war made on the 'home fronts' of former colonies. Several curators at the Museum have developed expertise in this field and have engaged externally in opening it up to new audiences. The Museum - where BME audiences are currently under-represented in its visitor profile - is determined to continue the work it has already begun so that this lesser- known aspect of the two world wars is given greater prominence. 

The review will be undertaken by the Museum in consultation with an advisory panel of academic and community historians who will provide guidance to the investigators. They will undertake a survey of literature and other media productions (television and radio documentaries, websites etc) to identify areas where work has already been done and, more particularly, where work remains to be done to draw out the history of 'colonial' participation in the two World Wars and to develop present-day communities' understanding of that history. 

Topics identified for future work will not be restricted to those relating to dealings between people originating in one-time colonies and the inhabitants of a former Imperial power, but to the history of intra- and inter-community relations as well. For example, relationships between the Hindu, Sikh and Muslim components of the 'Indian' community, or between the Caribbean and African communities, will be explored. It will also be instructive to cover communities now in Britain that originate from parts of the colonised world such as Vietnam and the Philippines that were never under British rule but which were still affected by the World Wars.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact via the Imperial War Museum:
The project will inform IWM's own future plans and activities in its engagement with communities through the development of

policies for exhibitions and public programme activities across its various physical sites (especially IWM London and IWM North)

publications and new educational and outreach resources and activities (the latter to mesh with the activities covered by the HLF-funded The War We Know? project mentioned above)

additional capabilities and features on the IWM website and its other new media offerings (social networking sites, podcasts, etc)

future revisions of its collections development strategy, informing decisions on priorities for the conservation and digitisation of existing collection materials and the acquisition of artefacts and archival records to the Museum's collections.

Impact via other institutions:
 Dissemination of the results of the research through the web will place in the hands of academics and teachers and curators across a wide spectrum of Higher and Further Education institutions, of curators and archivists and of leaders and members of the communities themselves, a survey of work already completed or underway in the fields covered by the project, facilitating the perception of emerging trends and - perhaps more significantly - of gaps in current work.

Impact via the media:
Dissemination of the results of the research will help alert TV producers and commissioning editors to the existence of new subjects for history documentaries and may introduce authors to potential new topics for fictional or dramatic explorations of topics in this area. Two prominent tv/ radio documentaries who have made programmes drawing on IWM archives, will be invited to join the Advisory Group.

Impact via networking:
Not least of the benefits of the project will be the dissemination between academic researchers and community historians of awareness of each other's activities, a process which will lead to the creation a network of people and organisations with interests in this field and which will pave the way to future joint activities. These will include academic conferences to explore the subjects covered by the project as well as more systematic community engagement in activities such asartefact handling sessions, talks, screenings and discussions, family history festivals etc.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24575</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Whose Remembrance?

This research project aims to investigate the representation and experience of colonial troops during the First World War. The project will use an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on the rich visual and material collections held in the archives of the IWM, particularly posters, artefacts, photographs, film and documents. Through this approach, the research aims to recover and understand more fully the experience of the thousands of men from the colonies who came to Europe between 1914 and 1918, who have often been neglected in previous histories. It is hoped that this research project will encompass a comparative transnational dimension.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>King's College London (KCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Cultural exchange in a Time of Global Conflict: Colonials, Neutrals and Belligerents during the First World War (CEGC)</gtr:description><gtr:id>8F69F968-93C5-4867-B8AA-8301FD253ADB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The conference 'The Indian Army on the Western Front', held at In Flanders Fields Museum, Ypres in October 2014 and public event 'Terrible Beauty: music and writing of the First World War' in Kings College London's chapel on Remembrance Day 2014, have both been outputs of this project to date.

&amp;quot;The Whose Remembrance? project has been crucial in filling the gap in history that has overlooked the contribution of colonial troops in both world wars. I was privileged to hold an over-subscribed screening of the documentary at the House of Commons during Remembrance month. It attracted individuals of all ages and all professions, keen to learn more about this neglected area of history, and to establish ways of sharing this information.

IWM has particularly rich resources with which to research this subject, and our project served to highlight this, as well as the benefits to be gained through involving communities in researching historical topics which are part of their heritage. Researchers worked on the production of three databases: published works produced by academics and community historians over the last thirty years; exhibitions and resources developed by museums and cultural organisations; and cultural outputs such as films, documentaries, novels and plays. Two workshops were held at IWM London, the first with historians and the second with museum professionals and community representatives. The team also included three specialist researchers - Arthur Torrington CBE, Project Director of the Windrush Foundation, Ansar Ahmed Ullah of the Swadhinata Trust, and Ouleye Ndoye, a postgraduate Anthropology student from Oxford University - who assessed the accessibility and usefulness of IWM collections for understanding and interpreting historical topics which they chose. A specially- commissioned film summarised the study's findings which has since been screened at community events and academic conferences both within the UK and internationally. Additionally an online publication, Researching the British Empire in the First World War, has been published on the IWM website for community groups and individuals wishing to conduct their own research in this area. Public engagement with the project has far exceeded our original expectations, and we have engaged with a wide range of users including members of the BME community; educators; community group leaders; civil servants; healthcare professionals; academics and politicians who have all been keen to access our research.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>BF6A7454-0483-454C-AB04-76A7C67C3C27</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project has successfully strengthened and extended the network of academics from different disciplines, museum professionals, independent researchers and representatives from community associations who have a mutual interest in this area of history. Two workshops at held at IWM London - one for historians, and one for museum professionals, community workers and representatives, helped initiate the process of engaging with the wider community.

As part of the project three databases of work in this area were published online, providing a comprehensive overview of published research and available productions in other media (exhibitions, documentary film, radio, television, websites etc.) covering the experiences of the peoples of Britain's former empire in the two world wars. 

A DVD showcasing the project was produced and this has been especially useful in engaging the wider public with our work. IWM led a series of public screenings of the Whose Remembrance? film including at the UK Houses of Parliament; IWM North in Trafford; King's College London; The Tomlinson Centre in Hackney, London, in partnership with Hackney Council and the Black and Ethnic Minority Arts Network (BEMA); the University of Bedfordshire in partnership with Luton Culture; and the Whitechapel Idea Store in London. 
The film has also been screened at external events including by the Alliance Fran&amp;ccedil;aise de Dhaka in Bangladesh; the Heritage Lottery Fund at the V&amp;amp;A in London; the United Service Institution of India in New Delhi; and at the 2014 Ginsberg Film Festival in South Africa. 

Copies of the DVD have been circulated to many different community and governmental organisations including the All Party Parliamentary Group on Race and Community; the British Council; the Jamaican High Commission; Luton Council; Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Brent Council and the East Staffordshire Rights and Equality Council; Cobden Community Centre in Bolton; the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology in Liverpool: and Life Long Learning KZN (a non-profit organisation offering educational events and courses to the public) in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Other museums and archives have also requested copies of the DVD including the Preston Park Museum in Stockton-on-Tees, Lambeth Archives, National Museums Liverpool, Redbridge Museum and Luton Culture. 

We have also published Researching the British Empire in the First World War, an online guide for community groups and individuals wishing to conduct their own research in this area.

IWM is hosting a dedicated webpage on the project where visitors can download all the project outputs and the Whose Remembrance? film has been published on YouTube. Additionally numerous posts relating to the project have been published via the IWM Research Blog.

Through working on this project we were made acutely aware of the need felt within the BEM community for further projects to engage with this previously underexplored history. Additionally, it has highlighted how efforts in this area need to be properly sustained: many community members felt that the typical 'Black History Month' approach was tokenistic and perpetuated the notion of Black history being little more than an 'occasional diversion' from the mainstream of British history.

Finally, the project meshed very usefully with another European project in which IWM is associate partner - the HERA (Humanities in the European Research Area) project Cultural Exchange in a Time of Conflict: Colonials, Neutrals and Belligerents during the First World War. A collaborative doctoral award student co-supervised by the Project Leader of CEGC, Dr Santanu Das, and Suzanne Bardgett, PI of Whose Remembrance? has had her studentship enriched through contact with both projects, and Suzanne Bardgett gave a paper on an aspect of Indian troops in the First World War at a HERA conference held in Ypres, in October 2014.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have printed 1,550 copies of the Whose Remembrance? DVD and are continuing to send these out to community groups, schools and other organisations involved in research in this area, who are wishing to conduct their own events and screenings.
Through the Researching the British Empire in the First World War online research guide we are encouraging communities and individuals to conduct their own research in this area, and giving them guidance to enable them to do so.
We are continuing discussions with representatives of prominent BEM community groups to work with them to ensure they have input into IWM's future programming.
Through the First World War Centenary Partnership programme website we have digitised a selection of images relating to the British Empire's involvement in the First World War and these have been made available to partnership members for use in their own exhibitions and events. We have established an online forum entitled 'The British Empire at War' on the Centenary Partnership website where members can discuss their own research projects and ask for advice or further information.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0D8FE64D-6981-4828-BDBD-23E0D74D6F30</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/research-programmes/whose-remembrance</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of literature which relates to the experiences of the peoples of Britain's former Empire during the two World Wars.</gtr:description><gtr:id>180AF19D-0491-400F-8112-F73B17E44DA1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers are able to use the database published on the IWM website.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Literature Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/research-programmes/whose-remembrance</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of published works produced by academics and community historians over the last thirty years relating to the experiences of the peoples of Britain's former Empire during the two World Wars.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E1A7B104-FA94-44C0-A36F-300178FB6452</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers are able to use the database published on the IWM website.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Published Research Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/research-programmes/whose-remembrance</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of film and TV productions relating to the experiences of the peoples of Britain's former Empire during the two World Wars</gtr:description><gtr:id>6919BD2C-D24A-4C71-B5C4-C15A3BB1517F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers are able to use the database published on the IWM website.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Film and TV Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/research-programmes/whose-remembrance</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Database of museum projects relating to the experiences of the peoples of Britain's former Empire during the two World Wars.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B53F83CE-AE83-4E09-A66B-6C4396AE77D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Researchers are able to use the database published on the IWM website.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Museum Projects Database</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections-research/research-programmes/whose-remembrance</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/59E15105-6ECC-4B90-8334-09124E8BB9D5"><gtr:id>59E15105-6ECC-4B90-8334-09124E8BB9D5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Researching the British Empire in the First World War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4d3c55c16f603ae8909fc4cf0f2d6669"><gtr:id>4d3c55c16f603ae8909fc4cf0f2d6669</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>IWM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AFAC4C0E-EE55-47EA-9D01-E7D39DF636A9"><gtr:id>AFAC4C0E-EE55-47EA-9D01-E7D39DF636A9</gtr:id><gtr:title>A scoping study of the available research on communities and the colonial experience of two world wars</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fc862e05b5c1765e65daa47c7fed4f39"><gtr:id>fc862e05b5c1765e65daa47c7fed4f39</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bardgett, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/71068C3F-F57F-4E02-88DA-82C7F5E643FF"><gtr:id>71068C3F-F57F-4E02-88DA-82C7F5E643FF</gtr:id><gtr:title>How did people share their cultures and traditions during the First World War?
