Data</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L011921/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The Urban Big Data Research Centre (UBDRC) will provide a unique facility for researching complex and cross-cutting urban issues such as transport, employment, migration, housing, education and social exclusion. The Centre will bring together an internationally-outstanding combination of researchers and data, focussed on the City of Glasgow but linked to extensive local, national and international networks and facilities. The project will be led by University of Glasgow, with the universities of Edinburgh, Cambridge, Reading, Bristol and Illinois-Chicago as partners.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The PI and centre director is Dr. Piyushimita (Vonu) Thakuriah, Halcrow Chair of Transport and Professor, Urban Studies and Affiliated Professor, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aims of the UBDRC are to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>establish a facility for urban research, products and services by creating a multi-sectoral linked urban Big Data infrastructure&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver a programme of cutting-edge research on urban planning, policy, dynamic resource management, and business innovations, towards improving social justice, lifelong learning, urban engagement and smart/future city technologies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>provide outreach, training and knowledge exchange activities.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Our work will draw on urban and regional modelling, and methods from computational, statistical, data science, and complex systems approaches for transformative theoretical understanding and knowledge discovery regarding substantive urban challenges.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the work of the centre?
The research conducted or facilitated by the UBDRC will have an impact on a range of non-academic groups, including local and national government, other public bodies, businesses, voluntary sector organisations, civic groups and the wider public. Some will benefit as data owners facing fewer burdens in data sharing in future. A much wider group will benefit from the substantive research conducted through the UBDRC as we aim to facilitate research on cross-cutting urban issues, as well as more methodological research. We aim to have an impact on economic competitiveness, on social welfare and well-being, and on the efficiency of public services and policy interventions. Training and capacity building activities will also be accessible to non-academic groups

How will they benefit from the work of the centre?

1. Data owners
There is some scope for the UBDRC to reduce the burden of requests on data owners by providing a first point-of-call and expert guidance on data availability and quality. Having established a relationship with the UBDRC, data owners will be able to provide access to data through us using standard protocols and procedures, knowing the facility safeguards their interests. This in turn makes it easier for research commissioners to formulate and commission research ideas, since they will have greater certainty over what is available and how long it will take to access it. Time and cost savings will be realised, but we also hope new research ideas will be formed that, hitherto, did not seem feasible. 

2. Policy makers in local government, national government and voluntary sector
A wide range of actors in local government could benefit from the increased understanding of diverse social and economic processes, and of the impacts of their policies and interventions. There could be benefits for service delivery. Research may stimulate horizontal discussions within partnership organisation such as Community Planning Partnerships due to enhanced awareness of the inter-relationships between services. Vertical discussions may be stimulated with national government bodies (Scottish Government or UK level e.g. DWP) or with civic of voluntary organisations representing particular service-user groups. 

3. Researchers and research organisations
We will offer advanced training in the methods necessary to access and analyse the linked data. A wide range of researchers in public, voluntary and business sectors may benefit, both directly from the skills developed and indirectly through their enhanced capacity to use the facility to address research issues which matter to them. 

4. Businesses
Businesses may benefit from more effective policies and investments to support their activities: in land preparation or land release; in transport investment; in skills development and training. 

5. The wider public
The wider public may benefit in diverse ways. More efficient or competitive businesses or public services may impact directly employment opportunities or social welfare. A better understanding of the impacts of particular services - or the costs of withdrawing them - may help certain groups defend services of particular importance to them. In particular, we would expect that research into distributional issues would tend to provide insights which enable less powerful groups to represent their interests.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-01-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>7593770</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The Urban Big Data Centre's integrated Multimedia City Data (iMCD) project has produced innovative primary data sources about Glasgow, Scotland's largest city, in combinations which have never before been collected.

ABSTRACT: For many social scientists &amp;quot;Big Data&amp;quot; equals &amp;quot;Big Rubbish&amp;quot;. The gulf between Big Data and meaningful, substantive, theoretically-informed, social inquiry is too cavernous to bridge, the links too tenuous to hold. Others argue it is how social research will be done in the future, convinced that the rising sun of Big Data will herald the dawn of a new renaissance of social science. So is the union of Big Data and &amp;quot;proper&amp;quot; social science a union made in heaven or an arranged marriage destined for divorce? Is the entire endeavor a red herring or golden opportunity? In this seminar Gwilym will survey the mixed metaphors and argue that, while the disconnects are real, so too are the opportunities. But how do we get this troubled relationship onto a sure footing? The seminar will explore the role of intermediates such as the SMI (Sheffield Methods Institute) as match makers -- ways of forming a nexus between methods, big data and social theory. He will then pose the question of how we make this happen in practice, drawing on practical examples from his own research to illustrate the kind of challenges perhaps best faced together.

'The smartphones study, funded under the ESRC's transformative research funding stream, aimed to assess the functionality and acceptability of using smartphone apps as a data collection tool for social research, and to assess ethical issues with their use. The project involved developing a smartphone app to conduct a study of drug and alcohol use and leisure activities among adolescent school pupils, as well as a thematic analysis of ethics committee opinions on this study from various disciplines. The seminar will explore the practical, cultural and social barriers to using this method and make recommendations for using apps to collect social research data.'&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Strava Metro - Better Data for Better Cities</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A8A323E-1612-4BF0-9A72-BE62D3C13FA3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Brian Riordan, Customer Success Lead from Strava Metro joined the UBDC to provide an overview of the data, methods of preparation for multiple forms of analysis, and time to discuss ideas for using it in urban research.

Fire and rescue services are one of the fundamental public services provided by government in order to protect people, properties and environment from fires and other disasters. 
Understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of fire incidents enables better fire risk estimation and thereby can assist with future allocation of prevention resources and strategic planning of mitigation programs. Data-intensive analyses and modelling in the era of big data has become an efficient way to approach Smart Fire. Using a 12-year (2002-2013) dataset, this research explores the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban fires in Nanjing, China, with a range of exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) approaches and tools. Based on the identified spatiotemporal distributions of fire incidents, spatial optimization models are developed to site the fire stations so that the urban residents can be provided with the best fire service coverage.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/events/event/?eventid=82312</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scottish Transport Emissions Partnerships (STEP) Annual Conference (Marian Scott attended)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CAAC40C8-619E-4025-A1E3-5C2DDC5EFD2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UBDC Co-I Marian Scott is attending this conference with a key partner STEP.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Women in Tech Scotland Meet-up (Glasgow)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>022E7BC5-5D81-42C2-835A-81D17DBB3F74</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The first meetup of Women in Tech, Scotland gave a chance to hear from women working in a range of tech roles in Scotland and for discussion on topics, speakers and venues for future events.

There will also be thematic breakout sessions where delegates will have an opportunity to discuss their research priorities and how SDAI could be used as a mechanism to address them. The aim is to develop ideas for future research themes and proposals that could be submitted to the SDAI in the future in collaboration with partner organisations. The sessions will be led by the interests of attendees but are likely to cover themes such as: Health, Wellbeing and Ageing; Education; Economics and Business; Equality and Social Mobility; Politics and Governance; and International Development.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UBDC Call for Expressions of Interest: Webinar Info Session</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02C80A57-04D1-42A7-AE0C-E94EF4E817A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Webinar session to explain UBDC services and the first UBDC Call for Expressions of Interest, with Q&amp;amp;A.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jduApotPZHA</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UBDC Methods Session: The City in 3D, Modelling Cities with GPS Trajectories (Katarzyna Sila-Nowicka)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DA932295-173F-4EA2-8422-4FBFAD775BC4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UBDC Research Associate in Urban Methods, Modelling and Simulations, Katarzyna Sila-Nowicka, presented to mixed audience of local researchers and technical staff.

Starting in 2004, the Summer Schools are still as popular as ever, and nearly all participants enthuse about the exciting and diverse range of people they have met, the shared experiences they have had and the challenging concepts they have discussed and developed.

Each host chooses a theme to base the week of activtiy around and many take the opportunity to introduce a topic that is of importance to the host university, region or country, thus making it a culturally-relevant experience for foreign students and an opportunity for local students to gain international perspectives on &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; issues.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Prof. Mark Stephen Fox (University of Toronto) Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B049D49-0657-4AA8-A5BB-83181776056D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Mark S.

Cities use a variety of metrics to evaluate and compare their performance. With the introduction of ISO 37120, which contains over 100 indicators for measuring a city's quality of life and sustainability, it is now possible to consistently measure and compare cities, assuming they adhere to the standard. The goal of this research is to develop theories, embodied in software, to perform longitudinal analysis (i.e., how and why a city's indicators change over time) and transversal analysis (i.e., how and why cities differ from each other), in order to discover the root causes of differences. The first phase of this project focuses on the creation of standard representations of city knowledge (i.e., Vocabularies and Ontologies) that can be used to represent indicators and their supporting data and publish them on the Semantic Web. The second phase focuses on the development of consistencyn axioms that automate the determination of whether a city's indicators and supporting data are consistent with the ISO 37120 definitions, and whether they are longitudinally and transversally consistent. The third phase focuses on the development of diagnostic algorithms that identify the root causes of longitudinal and transversal differences. Due to the heterogeneity of the supporting data, the applicability of classical diagnostic techniques is limited. This seminar will summarize the progress to date of all three phases.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>47th Annual UTSG (Universities' Transport Study Group) Conference, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>199D776B-7CD1-4A9C-8502-861FF3AD3F5D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Attendance and presentation by Vonu Thakuriah.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.city.ac.uk/utsg-2015</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering and the Institute for Transportation, Iowa State University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D02F2C68-C783-4907-BABE-1DFC798FF572</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Vonu' presented &amp;quot;Public Transportation and Move towards Big Data&amp;quot; at the Department of Civil, Construction and Environmental Engineering and the Institute for Transportation, Iowa State University.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Big Data Techniques to Improve Learning Access and Citizen Engagement for Adults in Urban Environments - International Conference for Taipei Learning City</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>12A3CAD3-D510-4F8B-8CB6-DEA7F4BA7BD3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UBDC Co-I Prof. Mike Osborne presented (via remote link) on Big Data Techniques to Improve Learning Access and Citizen Engagement for Adults in Urban Environments.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> University of Illinois at Chicago / NSF - Workshop on Big Data and Urban Informatics, 11-12 August 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Scientific meeting (conference/symposium etc.)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5067ED9-A363-4C11-872E-2BCA25B179EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talks and meetings sparked interest in new international collaborations with UBDC.

The Moving Across Places Study (MAPS): Measuring the Influence of Light Rail Transit and Complete Streets on Physical Activity

Lack of physical activity (PA) and consequent poor health outcomes such as obesity, diabetes and some cancers is a persistent public health issue. Planners and policy leaders often view public transit as a means for increasing PA levels. While there is evidence that public transit users are more physically active overall, it is not clear whether it is new or shifted from other forms of existing PA. The typically greater time required to use public transit relative to automobile trips suggests that users may substitute transit-related PA for other activities such as recreational walking and biking, attenuating the health benefits of public transit. Using GPS and accelerometer data from a quasi-experimental study of PA before and after construction of a light rail line and walkability enhancements in a neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah USA, we investigate changes in PA and explore disaggregate and spatial effects. Adult participants wore accelerometers and GPS loggers for approximately one week during pre-construction (Time 1) and post-construction (Time 2) of a Complete Street intervention involving a light rail line, new sidewalks and a bike path. Participants also completed surveys for socioeconomic, attitudinal and behavioral data. We examine 537 participants with complete accelerometer and GPS data for both time periods. Results suggest that transit ridership is associated with new PA rather than drawn from existing PA. This implies that public health benefits should be considered in public transit policies and plans.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Future Cities Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F3D8B88-29DE-4485-A1D8-BB83D230F662</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Identify challenges in the Future Cities landscape that satellite data could potentially be used to solve.

Title: What can Big Data tell us?
 
Description: Each transaction, tube journey or tweet now adds to the enormous volume of data we generate in near real time. These data get collated in enormous databases that offer a rich resource for those wanting to better understand human behaviour. Such data can now be used by a dizzying array of organisations to better plan transport networks for our daily commute, send offers from our favourite retailers or target help to those living in fuel poverty. In our exhibition we will showcase research and interactive maps that tell us anything and everything about you and your surroundings - come and explore what big data says about you.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Alasdair Gray Seminar at UBDC</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B15CEDC-CEEF-451D-99F8-9761A6451801</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Title: Data Integration in a Big Data Context

Abstract: Data is being generated all around us - from our smart phones tracking our movement through a city to the city itself sensing various properties and reacting to various conditions. However, to maximise the potential from all this data, it needs to be combined and coerced into models that enable analysis and interpretation. In this talk I will give an overview of the techniques that I have developed for data integration: integrating streams of sensor data with background contextual data and supporting multiple interpretations of linking data together. At the end of the talk I will overview the work I will be conducting in the Administrative Data Research Centre for Scotland.

ABSTRACT

Learning for a better life: reflecting across cultures

In rural communities around the world, people have long recognised the power of informal learning to transform their lives and have developed their own strategies for sharing and adapting indigenous and new knowledge with their peers and family members to improve their livelihoods. However, international and national Education For All policy has continued to take a narrow focus on learning as synonymous with schooling and formal education/training. Drawing on ethnographic-style research conducted for UNESCO-IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) in rural areas of Cambodia, Egypt and Ethiopia, this seminar will explore young people's aspirations in these contexts - and how they set out to gain new knowledge, skills and opportunities for a better life.

These include publications in highly ranked world-leading journals such as Social Science and Medicine, Transportation Research Part C, International Journal of Sustainable Transportation and Journal of Transport Geography, among several other highly ranked journals.
 
One notable scientific achievement from this period is the publication by Springer Geography in October 2016 of a new academic book, Seeing Cities Through Big Data: Research, Methods and Applications in Urban Informatics, edited by, and with contributions from UBDC Director Prof. Thakuriah and two of our consortium team, Nebiyou Tilahun and Moira Zellner of the University of Chicago Illinois. Originally started with the support of the US National Science Foundation, and building upon the knowledge we have derived from the UBDC, this book includes 26 papers demonstrating the novel use of data to address complex urban challenges relating to transport, housing, energy, the environment, public health and the economy, and cross-cutting issues relating to sustainability, social justice and urban and civic institutions. 

Another key highlight is that UBDC researcher Yashar Moshfeghi's paper &amp;quot;Understanding Information Need: An fMRI Study&amp;quot; won the best paper award in the 39th International ACM SIGIR conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval. Finally, UBDC researchers Thakuriah et al made key contributions to a journal special issue on Urban Informatics, while Lido et al contributed to a book on Quality of Life in Adult Learning. Series, highlighting the use of big data in the education literature.

Aside from our internal scientific impact, some of our data products have generated considerable interest among a range of scientists in diverse disciplines, who are undertaking novel research using our data. A key example is the iMCD data, which has attracted over 50 users to date, from vastly different disciplines. One example of research use is identifying the psychosocial impact of chronic stressors or pinch-points in cities; a second use looks at the links between digital literacy and transport patterns; while a third examines the effect of weather on cycling. A mix of data sources we supplied (iMCD, SUDS, Strava) is enabling another researcher look at the spatiotemporal dynamics of cities and the identification of evolving new centres of urban activity and property markets and how property markets respond to fast urban dynamics. Yet another data user is looking at Nestoria data to understand the links between housing prices and transport infrastructure. 
We also have a number of external projects under way, including eight projects approved by our RAC (and one pending re-submission) using our Controlled Data Service and Data Sourcing Service, and a much larger number who have requested data from our Open and Safeguarded Collection. The potential for scientific impact looks promising for all of these; while none are at the point of having final publications or other outputs, there are over a dozen projects currently with firm plans or drafts of papers, conference presentations, and reports (e.g. to public bodies on policy) in the pipeline. We are monitoring all of these carefully to ensure our ongoing support helps them get there, and to make sure we can record and publicise their successes, assist them with future research, and make links through KE with appropriate stakeholders. 

Economic and Societal Impact: UBDC's economic and societal impacts are of two types: those that accrue from our research and those that result from the data service infrastructure.
Impact of our research: Last year, we noted the impacts we are generating in the areas of urban mobility, smart cities and housing. We continue to make headways in these area particularly in building up data-driven evidence for the links between transport infrastructure, labour markets, the economy and productivity. In the area of urban mobility, we have formed strong links with a number of private companies such as Ch2m, PTV, Systra and others, with which we have had exchanges for technical expertise in big data, proposal development, knowledge exchange and their involvement in our training programmes. We have now built up a large comprehensive UK-wide database on public transport as a part of our SUDS programme and our Strava data are being utilised or has been requested for use by a number of companies. These and other transport data such as the iMCD travel diary have been requested by a number of private companies and third sector organisations.

Our last Annual Report noted the foundations of a considerable opportunity under way for societal impact - the housing sector. We have expanded our housing data collection to include Nestoria data for all-UK and similarly, Zoopla data for all-UK with considerable historical data on offer. These two datasets are providing our internal 'Private Rental Sector' project with fantastic opportunities to produce research that can make a direct contribution to housing policy, and have also gleaned around 20 requests from external users, ranging from ONS to a small Scottish start-up business. In addition, we are at the point of achieving a data sharing agreement with Registers of Scotland to make land registry data available to researchers, both internal and external. We continue to work to expand the housing data offer, and develop research synergies between our housing programme and other areas.

Another area where societal impact is looking very positive is in education - specifically our internal education research programme, our education data collections, and external projects coming to us to work with both of these. We have secured access to an extract of a pupil-level administrative dataset which can provide unique insights into the geography of residential and school choices. We have additional bespoke data from UCAS and HESA systems to examine the post-school educational world and to inform policy in this area. 
Impact of the UBDC data infrastructure: Our work on data infrastructure continues to gain visibility, and our approaches to putting together novel forms of naturally-occurring data and the associated analytics and knowledge discovery approaches have generated knowledge exchange and learning requests internationally. These links are being established to demonstrate the social and economic value of making complex urban data available to researchers, businesses and government agencies. 

Selected examples where UBDC's data infrastructure has been spotlighted as evidence of new ways of making data available are: (1) the City of Helsinki (where UBDC was the main external contributors including keynote in an event held by the Mayor of Helsinki called &amp;quot;Rebooting Helsinki with Big Data&amp;quot;, Jan 26, 2017); (2) US National Science Foundation's Civil Materials and Manufacturing Directorate's (the UBDC director have a keynote on Feb 6, 2017 in a workshop held in NSF, Arlington VA, on future CMMI data infrastructures); (3) Statistics Netherlands' (CBS) new Urban Data Centres with several Dutch cities and a Big Data Centre housed in their main office in the Hague (Statistics Netherlands has proposed an MOU with us and this is in progress and our Senior IT and Data Services Manager, Dr Andrew McHugh conducted strategic talks around the opening of the UDC in Heerlen); and (4) US National Academy of Sciences Mapping Sciences Committee (the UBDC director gave a keynote on urban informatics to this group on April 14, 2016, particularly in reference to emerging developments in location-based services with big data). 
We have also established key links with the winning team of the highly competitive Grand Challenges on Smart Cities led by the City of Columbus, Ohio, USA, in partnership with Ohio State University - total funding $140 million with core funding from US Department of Transportation and Paul G. Allen's Vulcan, Inc and many others including leading global tech communities and local businesses and agencies. We are in conversation with them to get data from their connected vehicle programme in support of the growing number of researchers in the UK on autonomous and connected vehicles. In return, we are discussing some of the analytics and public engagement strategies they could use from UBDC.

Course topic: Network analysis is a particularly useful class of analysis, which can be performed with a Geographic Information System (GIS). Network analysis allows us to analyse problems which are connected to the transportation of goods or people across a network. Using these methods we can consider questions such as: What is the shortest route between two points? What is the service area for a facility? Where should bus stops be placed along a route in order to maximise ridership? The course covered how to get routing data, import it into ArcGIS and then perform analysis. This course builds on your existing GIS knowledge with a focus on network analysis for understanding spatial data and making informed, data-driven decisions that can be applied to urban planning and policymaking.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Introduction to R: SESSION 1</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3FE2732-7DFB-4B80-9B48-A981FB6F5854</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This training had 20 participants from academia, business and local government.

This, for example, may give insights into the citizens' behaviour, reactions and moods in certain contexts or at particular times. The dataset can be queried through a bespoke online tool by specific hashtag or tweet term, in order to return statistical information or specific Tweet IDs.

Captured tweets were those geolocated in Glasgow (based on a polygon around the geography), those from certain known Glasgow accounts (e.g. @BBCWestScot; @policescotland) and containing certain terms or hashtags (e.g. glasgow, or #glasgow2014).

Due to the terms of Twitter's licensing we may not redistribute or allow the downloading of full tweets. Instead the service will provide Tweet IDs in lieu of the tweets themselves.

We began with the 14 largest built-up areas in the UK. The resultant indicators not only provide contextual information to researchers studying complex urban problems but are also a tool for supporting local government and private sector decision-making. Examples of key indicators include datazone-level indicators of job accessibility and greenspace. We will be connecting the SUDS programme to a novel set of open-source technologies for GIS mapping, mobile development, visualisation and reporting so that citizens, small businesses, non-profit organisations and local governments can have an opportunity explore trends and patterns in their city/region.

Indicators currently complete and available to end users of UBDC are:
* Percentage of persons in full-employment (%) - Output Areas for 13 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast.
* Unemployed: Aged 16-24 years (%) - Output Areas for 14 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast.
* Unemployment rate - all economically active and inactive (%) - Output Areas for 14 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast.
* Unemployment rate-all economically active only (%) - Output Areas for 14 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast
* Public Greenspace - Output Areas for 14 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast.
* Job Accessibility Indicators (experimental) - Output Areas for 14 built-up areas: Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield, Southampton-Portsmouth, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Belfast.

Ongoing work to develop accessibility measures for labour market and healthcare are also yielding new data. As an outcome of our work to define transit accessibility indices we have developed, based on Traveline data, UK-wide public transportation schedules in the popular interchange GTFS format. These data offer timetables for bus, light rail, tram and ferry stops in Great Britain.

UBDC give researchers access to the data from the iMCD Household Survey, in anonymised form. The Survey has a unique combination of questions covering detailed information about each household, and their attitudes and behaviours to transport, education, computer and mobile phone usage, and sustainability. These data would be of interest to planners, researchers or individuals wanting to gain a better understanding of these topics and their interactions. The iMCD Household Survey interviewed a representative sample of adults (2095 people from 1508 household) in the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Planning area between April and November 2015. This area includes the following local authorities: Glasgow; North Lanarkshire; South Lanarkshire; Inverclyde; Renfrewshire; East Renfrewshire; East Dunbartonshire and West Dunbartonshire. As well as basic demographic data, the survey has a significant number of questions on education, transport, sustainability, and ICT usage. It also contains questions on civic and cultural activities, and neighbourhood belonging and satisfaction. Some variables have been removed or have had responses grouped to ensure anonymity of respondents, and there is no geographic or locational information. A subset of participants (1506) also completed a Travel Diary, describing their movements and purpose on the day prior to the Survey's collection. For widespread sharing, this data is aggregated to local authority level, consistent with the Scottish Household Survey methodolology. The iMCD project also gathered and created a number of other datasets that may be linked to the survey data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1FF7F59B-95CB-4B5B-BE43-3CC0D1CC58D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The UBDC released this initial dataset as part of our first Call for Expressions of Interest in February 2016.

Trajectory datasets are being generated in great volumes due to high levels of GPS and Location-Based
Services (LBS) use. Such data are increasingly being collected for a variety of academic, industrial and recreational reasons, sometimes
together with other strands of personal data such as socio-demographic, social survey and other sensor data carried/worn by the person (for example, fitness trackers, portable cameras etc).
In such cases, not only are movement data of a person available but also data on potentially a wide variety of other personal and
household attributes. Making such person-level data available for analytics opens up the possibility of new directions in analysing,
studying and understanding human behaviour, which is typically not possible with GPS trajectory datasets alone. At the same time,
the GPS data should be released in a privacy-preserving way that takes into account the possibility of re-identification of individuals
from quasi-identifiers available from other data strands. De-identification in these strands may be risked due to uniquely identifiable
information on significant locations and other spatial behaviours and choices detected from GPS trajectories. This is a privacy-enhancing approach,
when personally-identifiable data are available from multiple data strands, for the
specific purpose of data to be released for transport research.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F9C53737-D66E-4F22-AC00-D3D422B57646</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The approach was tested and ulitised to anonymise GPS data collected as a part of UBDC's Integrated Multimedia City Data (iMCD) project.

However, the number of tweets that are explicitly geo-tagged by users tend to be sparse (just 1 to 2% of the entire Twitter firehose) so that locations of critical events tweeted may be missed when considering geo-tagged tweets only. specific approach to enhancing the geographic details of non-geotagged tweets. This method deals with estimating the location where a tweet originated using multiple approaches. The process of estimating the locations of posts that are not associated with explicit coordinates is called &amp;quot;geolocalization&amp;quot;. The method has the potential to substantially increase the sample size of tweets available for real-time traffic operations assessment, event detection, public mood change detection and geo-localised community detection.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9D91503A-0AFB-49BF-92BE-23FF69EB812D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method has the potential to substantially increase the sample size of tweets available for real-time traffic operations assessment, event detection, public mood change detection and geo-localised community detection.
