However, since the statistics on marital status across ethnic groups were last analysed in the mid 1990s, there have been signs of a trend towards marital breakdown and divorce among British Asians. Community- and faith-based organisations have been struggling to provide marriage counselling and mediation services, and to respond to problems of mental wellbeing and welfare for lone parent families.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project seeks to provide concrete data on the rise in marital breakdown among British Asians. The focus is two major British Asian populations: Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs. Whilst these groups differ in traditional marriage patterns and religious identity, they have high rates of transnational marriage, similar gender dynamics in families, and similar migration histories.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Principal Investigator will conduct repeated interviews with Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs to understand the causes, processes and consequences of marriage breakdown. Intended outputs will inform questions of legal pluralism and diversity in welfare, reorient debates about conservatism in British Asian families, and engage with theory concerning the family. Ethical approval has been granted by the Central University Research Ethics Committee of Oxford University.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ESRC:
ESRC Strategic Plans foreground the societal importance of population diversity and dynamics, particularly concerning migration policy, generational shifts, changing family and household relations in the context of increased female employment, understanding the role of religion in society, complex and deeply embedded differences in practices alongside the intersections of ethnicity, religion, class, locality and gender, questions of social justice alongside potential fractures to collective and civic identities. Speaking clearly to these areas, this project will contribute to the ESRC's wider programme of high quality research capable of shifting public discourse and government policy at various levels.

Public debate:
Public discourses around British Asian families abound with concerns about forced marriage, honour killings and domestic violence, heightening public attention to the subordination of British Asian women. South Asian marriage migration has similarly raised concerns about 'bogus' marriage and the vulnerabilities of linguistically-isolated immigrant wives. More nuanced information on the diversity and dynamism of British Asian family practices is urgently needed to address popular misconceptions and stereotypes. Recent calls for regulation of religious marriage and polygamy suggest this may be a further area in which the study may influence public debate.

Policy makers: 
This project will provide timely empirical evidence against which is should be possible to assess the appropriateness of recent changes in legislation on marriage migration aimed at protecting British citizens and reducing immigration fraud. Questions to which the research may speak include: Does divorce shortly after grant of British passports suggest immigration fraud, or unforeseen marital challenges? Does later age at marriage improve the quality of marital relationships? In what situations does polygamy arise and what are its consequences? What relationships exist between forced marriage and divorce?

Service providers:
Social Workers, Marriage Guidance &amp;amp; Mediation, Divorce Lawyers, Women's Refuge
Each of these professions may become involved in marital conflict or divorce. Documenting dynamics of marital instability among British Asians will help ensure appropriate service provision, reducing reliance on stereotypical assumptions of unchanging gender roles or family practices.

Community groups and religious organisations:
Such bodies are often consulted in preference to those above by British Asian couples experiencing marital problems, and play a role in intra-community debate around marriage and divorce. As such, it is equally important that they are well informed about contemporary dynamics and available external services. Such bodies may also provide other support to reduce stresses on marriages.

British Asian couples and families: 
Benefits to couples and families will stem from improvements in services and policies generated by a more informed understanding of processes of marital instability and divorce among British Asians. More appropriate support may help resolve conflict, reducing suffering and family breakdown. Better-informed support services may minimise the negative consequences of divorce on couples and their children. Policy initiatives informed by nuanced research may avoid causing unanticipated harm to families and individuals. Individuals from the communities concerned may also benefit from directly from reading research outputs (in line with feedback from previous research). 
 
Most impacts of this project will be medium to long term. Dissemination will be of crucial importance in maximising impact. In addition to academic dissemination, findings will be made available on Sussex University website, through concise briefing papers to be distributed to wider target audiences, and through press release. A half day workshop will be held for invited representatives of concerned organizations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>79998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Duncan Lewis Solicitors</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Aina Khan: Register Our Marriages Project</gtr:description><gtr:id>2129A06D-AF54-4E73-8A15-7E6C9A2E1939</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Aina Khan has launched the survey in September 2014 and I have advised on how to look for funding and contacted Socio-Legal Studies department at the University of Oxford to explore how to officially endorse the project.

However, analysis of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey 2010-13 found that this is no longer the case. 

The ethnographic research carried out in this project focused on Pakistani Muslims and Punjabi Sikhs in a predominantly working class part of London. It has been assumed that marital breakdown among British Asians reflects a move towards the individualism that has been described for the wider White British population. In this research, similar forms of marital conflict were found as in the wider population, such as not putting up with oppression, wanting intimacy and not getting it, lack of commitment and sexual dissatisfaction. However, these conflicts played out in marriages that had frequently come about through extensive family involvement, and that were in the majority transnational. This made for distinct relational, cultural and legal contexts to marital breakdown. 

As in the wider White British population, responses to marital breakdown were predominantly privatized. Informal family mediation was claimed actively by men and women, which took culturally-elaborated forms. Religious arbitration was also sought. Family mediation and religious arbitration for both Pakistani Muslim and Punjabi Sikh participants worked on the basis of gendered understandings about husbands' and wives' roles within marriage, with attention focused on the spouse who was deemed to be at blame. None of the participants had explored formal marriage counselling, although some had experience of family mediation, particularly at the instigation of the courts. Contact with statutory services happened only in cases of domestic abuse. 

There were major differences in how the Pakistani Muslim and Punjabi Sikh participants approached divorce, due to the law-like nature of the sharia. Islamic divorces were sought in addition to civil divorces, wherever the latter was applicable. Importantly, there was a large number of Islamic practitioners who participants approached to get an Islamic divorce; they did not only turn to sharia councils as authorities. Among the Punjabi Sikhs, there were similar disconnections between court and religious marriages in cases of remarriage. As in the wider White British population, the majority of civil divorces were applied for by women. The important negotiations in civil divorces took place informally and frequently outside court. 

Half the participants had remarried, in relationships typically very different from their first marriages. Second marriages were often unstable. Half the participants had not remarried. Some found it empowering to be free of their marriage; for most, however, living alone was difficult. Divorce did not resolve conflict and there were gendered vulnerabilities. Children often grew up in poverty and with parents suffering mental ill-health. However, children were active in creating new forms of family life after divorce.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>British Asian people who are going through marital difficulties can gain valuable insights from being able to read others' experiences, as those who are going through marital breakdown usually feel that they are going through it alone. 

Community-based organizations can gain valuable data to support their work, particularly 
*those concerned with supporting lone parents, who will be able to make stronger claims for financial attention given that the prevalence of lone parenthood among British Asian groups is very similar to the prevalence in the wider population; 
*organizations providing support in cases of domestic abuse, who can gain information on the pervasiveness of domestic abuse in British Asian communities; 
*agencies concerned with mediation, who can gain data on the gendered assumptions that are brought to bear in family and religious arbitration for British Muslims and Sikhs; and
*marriage counsellors, who can gain important insights into the pervasive mental illness entailed in such situations, which rarely reaches the attention of mental health professionals. 

Statutory agencies can also take forward the findings: 
*the impoverishment of British Asian lone parents requires attention; 
*the Forced Marriage Unit should consolidate efforts at challenging forced marriage through religious advocates; and 
*recent Home Office family migration policies re: income requirements and extended five-year probationary periods should be reconsidered, as these prejudice citizens who are on low incomes and exacerbate the vulnerabilities of immigrant spouses, particularly women.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7A662B66-835C-41AB-9C99-7700EC7868C5</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.isca.ox.ac.uk/research/medical-and-ecological-anthropology/fertility-and-reproduction/migration-marital-instability-and-divorce-among-british-asians/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CBD56679-DA4F-4C70-98E1-F639925B056F"><gtr:id>CBD56679-DA4F-4C70-98E1-F639925B056F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Migration, marital instability and divorce among British Asians</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/506821eb3e20bf4e72ef9e2f04c9cc5e"><gtr:id>506821eb3e20bf4e72ef9e2f04c9cc5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Qureshi, Kaveri</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4417FC92-454D-40C8-9A9A-D12845C53EFF"><gtr:id>4417FC92-454D-40C8-9A9A-D12845C53EFF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Muslim women and shari'ah councils: transcending the boundaries of community and law</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Contemporary South Asia</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193"><gtr:id>53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Qureshi K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/821B8245-F686-4469-826E-046A3E8D6627"><gtr:id>821B8245-F686-4469-826E-046A3E8D6627</gtr:id><gtr:title>Shehri(city) brides between Indian Punjab and the UK: transnational hypergamy, Sikh women's agency and gendered geographies of power</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193"><gtr:id>53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Qureshi K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/552640C8-FE2D-4C85-B702-E1FFF2CFA8A5"><gtr:id>552640C8-FE2D-4C85-B702-E1FFF2CFA8A5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marital instability among British Pakistanis: transnationality, conjugalities and Islam</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ethnic and Racial Studies</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193"><gtr:id>53e8fbe845d283af512a300bb156f193</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Qureshi K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F59E6A3D-912B-4F0D-8B7D-A31017851692"><gtr:id>F59E6A3D-912B-4F0D-8B7D-A31017851692</gtr:id><gtr:title>Marital Breakdown among British Asians: Conjugality, Legal Pluralism and New Kinship</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/abeee503f80a97139da0ff0243cd2cb2"><gtr:id>abeee503f80a97139da0ff0243cd2cb2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Qureshi, K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1-137-57046-8</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/J003514/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>B57EEFB7-602E-4F5D-92E4-A0C265266249</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Demography &amp;
