Digital Fabrication enables agile, on-demand and fully automated production in a wide range of manufacturing contexts and is seen as a key enabling technology for future high-value manufacturing applications. Current Digital Fabrication technologies are however limited, in the range of materials which can be used, the processing speed and the resolution. 

In particular, the ability to combine multiple materials, for example metals and plastics, in a single process is very restricted at present and therefore this project seeks to address these limitations. This will be achieved by using a multi-process integration approach to Digital Fabrication where the best process for the application in hand can be selected. It combines the advantages of additive manufacturing, laser based processing and ink jet printing technologies to deposit and integrate different materials within each layer. 

The project addresses the fundamental scientific challenges required to interleave these different manufacturing techniques in order to achieve fine-grained control over the spatial distribution, microstructure and interface properties of the different materials to be laid down in each layer. 

These challenges include; 
1) The integration of different Digital Fabrication processes and the associated issues with the compatibility and transitioning between processing. 
2) The use of configurable laser profiles to control droplet evaporation properties and as result gain control over the so-called 'coffee-staining' effect. 
3) The use of laser-based surface texturing to improve the adhesion between the various layers to improve the overall mechanical properties of the part. 

The project will provide the unpinning research to enable the production of three-dimensional structures from a range of materials. This research brings together a unique combination of academic expertise in laser-based processing, additive manufacturing, ink jet printing and applied mathematics from four of the UK's leading research-led universities along with a consortium of industrial partners with strong track records in innovation for high value manufacturing applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-08</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157863</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - Additive Manufacturing of High Resolution Embedded Electronic Systems</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AB11E81E-96AF-4DA7-934C-83766BF70DB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation given at this event titled &amp;quot;Additive Manufacturing of High Resolution Embedded Electronic Systems&amp;quot; was well received and resulted in a host of new North American contacts and resulted in a number of requests for further information.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Additive Manufacturing and 3D printing workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0A9D7955-C1C3-4195-BAE5-E30B160971DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The International Microelectronics and Packaging Society (IMAPS) Workshop on Additive Manufacturing (printing) for packaging was hosted by Dr. Robert Kay at Loughborough University on the 22nd October 2015. This workshop brought together a range of individuals primarily from industry in order to introduce them to the current developments and activities in 3D printing applied to the field of electronics. The workshop was split into a morning session which educated these new individuals into the field of Additive Manufacturing and then in the afternoon covered the latest developments in academia and industry around 3D printing for electronics manufacturing. The research findings from two EPSRC projects was also showcased at this event (EP/L017415/1 &amp;amp; EP/L022133/1). Besides the networking benefits from this event the investigators on this grant were able to establish new collaborations with industry on existing and future research activities. The event also raised the awareness of many of the research activities in this field currently being conducted by UK Universities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://imapsuk.wordpress.com/2015/09/08/additive-manufacturing-and-3d-printing-workshop-programme-announced/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The template driven nature of traditional electronics manufacturing requires volume production to achieve economic viability. This results in long pre-production timescales and a lack of customisation and versatility. During electronics manufacturing a wide range of materials including conductors and dielectrics must be used in order to generate complex circuitry and interconnects. Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies, commonly termed 3D printing, are being widely publicised and promoted as the future of manufacturing. Their direct digital manufacturing capability allows rapid production of unique and complex geometries directly from a 3D CAD model without the need for templates or molds. To-date the vast majority of research in this field has been conducted on the use of individual AM processes which, in isolation suffer limitations in the range of materials, processing speed and resolution for the resulting part. In order to enable truly functional products using 3D printing, the integration of multiple digitally driven processes is proposed as the solution to many of the current limitations arising from standalone AM techniques. Advantageous process characteristics can be combined and the differing material capabilities of these processes provides a larger range of applications such as microfluidics, embedded sensor systems and electronics packaging.

During this project the team at Loughborough University (now University of Leeds) developed a novel manufacturing process chain involving the integration of direct light projection (DLP) based Stereolithography (SL) with direct write (DW) technology, facilitating the creation of fully functioning, packaged electronic circuits from a digital model. The combination of these manufacturing techniques coupled with mid-process cleaning, pick and placement of surface mount devices (SMDs) and thermal curing provides the multi-material, multi-process functionality required to produce high quality, high density printed electronics. The combination of these template-less fabrication technologies shows potential as a manufacturing technology for both iterative product development and end user applications in a number of industrial fabrication scenarios including lab on chip or microfluidics, embedded sensor systems, mechatronics and electronic packaging.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The combination of these
