We intend to achieve these by developing a hands-on activity aimed at children in Key Stages 2-4 which will provide an ongoing resource for use by the organisations involved in the project, and will be available on the Internet in a form suitable for schools, parents and anyone else with an appropriate Lego Mindstorms Robot to download and use.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre for Autonomous Systems Technology (CAST) at Liverpool is already active in promoting the Lego Rover activity via the STEM Ambassador scheme. The scheme provides a number of opportunities for sharing information about activities and resources with other ambassadors and with teachers, as well as linking ambassadors directly with schools. The activity will also feature in a training video being developed by the STEM Ambassador scheme.

Our participation in science fairs, festivals and open days, will provide a good opportunity to inform the general public about the downloadable resources that support the activity. We will ensure therefore that suitable material in the form of posters and leaflets are produced so that people encountering the activity at festivals, and networking events, can be directed to websites where it is available for download.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8996</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Destination:Space (World Museum, Liverpool)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6C1779F6-E74F-41C7-97B1-5C81CA95C995</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Activity engaged the interest of many children.

The children showed a real passion for everything about robots and demonstrated a good understanding already asking some relevant questions to Dr Dennis straight away. It was excellent that the children had such a hands on practical lesson and were so pleased when Dr Dennis spoke about the the use of robots on the moon and Mars. The Q and A at the end of the session and the children's enthusiasm was clearly evident.
