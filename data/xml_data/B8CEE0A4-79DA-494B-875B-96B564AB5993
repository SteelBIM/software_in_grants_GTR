While the prevalence of continence problems decreases with age, many children are still affected well into adolescence. There is currently little evidence-based information from epidemiological studies on the factors that distinguish between children who attain bladder and bowel control as expected and those who continue to suffer from wetting and soiling into later childhood and adolescence. Empirical findings from large cohorts could substantially increase understanding of risk factors for persistence of continence problems and aid identification of children who are at risk of chronic incontinence. Persistence of continence problems into adolescence is likely to lead to considerable distress for young people and their families. However, there are no empirical studies assessing the impact of incontinence on a wide range of outcomes in adolescence. Evidence-based knowledge of the impacts of incontinence on young people is needed to tackle their complex needs and to inform interventions. 

Aims and objectives: The proposed project will investigate risk factors and outcomes associated with continence problems in children and adolescents from a large contemporary UK cohort- The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Specifically, we will examine whether factors relating to the child and family are associated with different patterns of development (developmental trajectories) of bladder and bowel control in almost 11,000 children from early through to late childhood (4 to 9 years). These trajectories describe different patterns of development of bladder and bowel control, including normal development, delayed attainment of bladder/bowel control, persistent wetting/soiling, and relapse after an extended period of continence. We will investigate whether particular patterns of incontinence in childhood (e.g. high frequency and/or persistent incontinence) are less likely to resolve by adolescence. We will also examine whether persistence of incontinence into late childhood and adolescence is associated with adverse outcomes for mental health, psychosocial functioning, educational attainment and goals/aspirations for the future.

Potential applications and benefits: We anticipate that the research will lead to significant new understanding of the aetiology of continence problems. Greater awareness of risk factors associated with persistent continence problems is likely to result in improved identification, earlier intervention, faster referral- to-treatment times and increased likelihood of delivering services to those children who are most likely to benefit. Timely referral and management of continence problems should help to improve quality of life for children, young people and their families and reduce adverse personal impacts of continence problems on young peoples' lives. Greater awareness of co-morbid conditions such as mental health problems will inform interventions, leading to better outcomes for children and young people and their parents/carers.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We propose a mixed methods approach, including secondary analysis of ALSPAC data and a qualitative study of young people with continence problems to identify risk factors and outcomes associated with incontinence. We will use longitudinal data on wetting and soiling from almost 11,000 children aged 4 - 9 years to identify latent classes (developmental trajectories) of incontinence. The latent classes, identified using Longitudinal Latent Class Analysis (LLCA), will incorporate frequency of wetting/soiling in the models. 
We will use the latent classes as outcome variables to examine their association with time-invariant covariates using multinomial models incorporating class assignment probabilities to reflect the uncertainty in group membership. We will also explore methods for relating time-varying covariates to the latent classes. 
We will then use the latent classes of incontinence as exposure variables to examine their association with adolescent outcomes including self-reported wetting/soiling at 14 years and a range of adverse psychosocial outcomes at 14-15 years. We will use weighted logistic regression (Stata) to estimate the odds ratios associated with the adolescent outcomes for each of the atypical latent classes in relation to the normative class. 
We will conduct semi-structured qualitative interviews to examine the impact of incontinence in young people in relation to their mental health, relationships, social activities, education/school attainment and goals/aspirations for the future. The interview transcripts and free text from the survey will be analysed with NViVO software using iterative thematic analysis to explore salient issues, using constant comparison techniques. 
We anticipate that the findings of the proposed research will aid identification of children at risk of chronic incontinence and will contribute to patient-centered, age appropriate information resources on issues relating to incontinence in young people.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit:
Children and young people with continence problems and their parents and carers. 
Children's continence services.
Health professionals who work with children and young people with continence problems (paediatricians, urologists, gastroenterologists, paediatric continence nurses, child psychiatrists and clinical psychologists).
GPs, health visitors.
ERIC, policy makers, commissioners, managers, regulators, stakeholders working on children's and young people's health. 
NICE.
Organisations supporting policy makers/commissioners e.g. ChiMat. 
Educational services (teachers, school nurses).

How will they benefit?
The research findings will benefit commissioners involved in redesigning paediatric continence services by increasing awareness of risk factors and patterns of childhood wetting/soiling associated with chronic incontinence. The latest guide on Commissioning a Paediatric Continence Service (NICE) states that one of the key components of an effective service is greater awareness of paediatric continence problems resulting in improved identification, earlier intervention and faster referral- to-treatment times. The research findings could help to identify children at risk of chronic incontinence and, therefore, increase the possibility of delivering services to those who are most likely to benefit from early intervention. This could ultimately help to prevent continence problems from becoming chronic, reducing referrals to secondary care and, ultimately, helping the NHS make better use of its resources. 

The research will benefit individuals working in primary care and clinicians who treat children with incontinence by providing an evidence base about risk factors and outcomes associated with continence problems. The ERIC Clinical Advisory Committee have voiced concerns from clinicians that there is a limited evidence base that provides empirical information about factors that predict the prognosis of continence problems. There is also little empirical information about the range of secondary issues experienced by young people with continence problems. 

The research has strong potential to help relieve the burden of incontinence and to improve quality of life for children, young people and their families. The research will help to increase awareness among parents about patterns of incontinence that may not resolve naturally and encourage parents to seek timely help for their child's incontinence. Older children and teenagers find it particularly hard to deal with incontinence due to the social stigma and the devastating impact on their self-worth and quality of life at a crucial stage of development. The findings will help young people to understand that they are not alone with their problem and there is help available. The proposed project aims to address the pressing need for sensitive, age appropriate information about continence issues in young people to help to reduce their emotional distress and encourage teens to seek help to manage their incontinence. 

The research will increase awareness and understanding among teachers and school nurses of the complex needs of children with continence problems and of the impact of incontinence on school life. 

Staff employed on the project will develop research skills that will be invaluable in terms of their career development. The statistician will have expert guidance from Dr Heron and Professor Tilling and support from a wide network of individuals currently involved in analysis of longitudinal data. The research psychologist will gain invaluable professional skills in conducting the qualitative study under the expert guidance of Dr Horwood.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326684</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Paediatric Continence Forum</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Paediatric Continence Forum</gtr:description><gtr:id>03B59E2F-CBA6-4C33-B5F9-96D3B39FD367</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.paediatriccontinenceforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/PCF-Commissioning-Guidance-for-NICE-11-August-2014-Final.pdf</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The invitation to join the Paediatric Continence Forum was from the Chair of the PCF, Dr Penny Dobson.

The existing literature that was available for young people was insufficient and not age appropriate. 

We designed new web pages for teenagers with continence problems on the website of The Children's Bowel &amp;amp; Bladder Charity- ERIC (http://www.eric.org.uk/Pages/Category/teens). These web pages provide educational resources and evidence based, age appropriate information and advice about living with continence problems. Participants we interviewed for this project were involved in co-producing the information for the web pages and provided feedback on the content.

The information resources on the ERIC website are designed to support young people with continence problems (daytime wetting, bedwetting, soiling). The webpages provide information about how many young people are affected by continence problems, where to go for help, what to expect when they see a clinician, and how to deal with continence problems at school and on trips away from home.

These webpages are also useful for clinicians treating young people with continence problems and for parents. This research has improved the evidence base to inform clinicians and parents about the range of secondary impacts experienced by young people with continence problems so that appropriate support can be offered e.g. some young people need psychological support.

The webpages have helped to change young people's understanding about continence problems. In particular, many young people with continence problems feel they are alone with the problem and they were surprised to learn that these problems are not uncommon.

&amp;quot;I found it really heartening to see the statistics of how many other young people have had the same problem as me and also read accounts from others&amp;quot;.
Due to the stigma of incontinence, young people find it difficult to talk about their problems and they develop strategies to manage their symptoms. The webpages provided advice about whether and how to tell friends and teachers about their continence problems and how to deal with their continence problems at school and on nights away.

[The webpages] &amp;quot;covered all the main issues that I faced and would like other teenagers in my situation to be aware of and there were some great tips on how to deal with tough situations and decisions&amp;quot;.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.eric.org.uk/Pages/Category/teens</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Contribution to letter to Kath Evans, Head of Patient Experience at NHS England</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78CC37E6-D593-4120-A16E-211E7059F75A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our findings relating to the adverse impacts of continence problems in young people were included in a letter sent by the Paediatric Continence Forum (PCF) to Kath Evans, Head of Patient Experience at NHS England. The aim of the letter was to to promote the PCF's local lobbying toolkit which is designed to help the parents and carers of children and young people with continence problems to lobby for improvements to NHS paediatric continence services at a local or national level. The value of these research findings is that we can provide direct quotes from young people when talking to MPs and commissioners. At one level they need facts and figures, but personal experiences will hopefully make them realise better what it is like for the 'patient'
The letter caught the attention of Kath Evans and, as a result she set up a teleconference with the Paediatric Continence Forum, ERIC and PromoCon last autumn. This was an information- sharing process - to increase her awareness, as Head of Patient Experience NHS England, of the issues children and young people with continence problems were facing. As a result she initiated a follow-up teleconference with the Lead Nurse for CYP at Public Health England, Wendy Nicholson - so that the PCF could play an active part in ensuring that new commissioning guidelines for children with complex health needs also included continence.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2900DA34-A2E6-4197-8601-304B2D241717"><gtr:id>2900DA34-A2E6-4197-8601-304B2D241717</gtr:id><gtr:title>The association between trajectories of bedwetting and daytime wetting in childhood and incontinence and lower urinary tract symptoms in adolescence.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/943413b6f522a2aac6e088e10de70f46"><gtr:id>943413b6f522a2aac6e088e10de70f46</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Joinson C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/489FD435-749F-46FE-BEE3-2DEFF7A7D996"><gtr:id>489FD435-749F-46FE-BEE3-2DEFF7A7D996</gtr:id><gtr:title>Factors Predicting Atypical Development of Nighttime Bladder Control.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7c2fca5267f43e399b8c4e80847aeb5e"><gtr:id>7c2fca5267f43e399b8c4e80847aeb5e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Sullivan S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0196-206X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/51316779-07F6-4F70-A800-98BACFE7B1CA"><gtr:id>51316779-07F6-4F70-A800-98BACFE7B1CA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Early childhood psychological factors and risk for bedwetting at school age in a UK cohort.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European child &amp;
