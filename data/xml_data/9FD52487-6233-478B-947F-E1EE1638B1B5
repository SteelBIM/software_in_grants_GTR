Project</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/J004170/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Magna Carta is one of the most famous documents in history, celebrated throughout the English-speaking world. It is widely seen as the foundation stone of the British constitutional tradition in which kings and law makers are themselves subjected to the rigours of the law. And yet, there is a great deal about Magna Carta that remains unknown. There has been no proper commentary on the original 1215 issue of Magna Carta in the past hundred years, and there has never been a proper commentary on the 1225 reissue of the charter that became the standard version, parts of it still on the Statute Book today. Despite the fact that all four of the original versions of Magna Carta preserved from the issue of 1215 have been granted UNESCO World Heritage status, there has never been a proper edition noticing all of the differences between these documents. The subsequent reissues of the charter, including the definitive version of 1225, have been left unedited and to a large extent unstudied since 1805. No-one is entirely sure of the relation between these texts, or indeed of how many reissues, or how many surviving copies there are from the first century of Magna Carta. Since the 1830s, there has been no systematic search for documentary evidences for King John. As a result, historians today have only a warped and incomplete understanding of large parts of John's reign, crucial for the making of Magna Carta. Because no work has been undertaken on the handwriting of John's original letters and charters, several hundred of which survive in archives scattered across Britain, Ireland and France, we are unable to say who wrote Magna Carta or whether the four surviving originals were written by royal or by other scribes. The present project, which combines input from four universities and the principal modern authorities on the subject, is intended to appeal both to scholars and to a more general public. It will fill many gaps in our knowledge of Magna Carta in time for the forthcoming 800th anniversary of the charter to be celebrated in 2015. The project's website, intended to become the first port of call for anyone interested in Magna Carta, will supply full commentaries and English translations of all of the various versions of the document. It will supply photographs and summaries not only of all of the surviving Magna Cartas but of several hundred related documents. It will explain the charter's significance, both in scholarly and in popular terms. It will supply access to a large body of documentary evidence, until now locked away in the archives, crucial for our understanding of the writing, marking, meaning and posterity of Magna Carta. It will be supplied with blogs, monthly features and postings intended both to broadcast these new discoveries and to satisfy public interest. Its result will be fed into a programme directed to schools and to public understanding as well as to scholars. It will assist in the mounting of a major Exhibition at the British Library in the anniversary year, 2015, accompanied by an international conference open to the general public, the media and to scholars. The conference will itself further disseminate the project's findings. Amongst these, besides the first proper edition of Magna Carta ever presented in all its guises, the first ever full commentary on the standard 1225 text of Magna Carta, and the first commentary since 1914 on the original version issued by King John, it is hoped that by 2015 we can not only explain 'Who wrote Magna Carta', but the context and the circumstances in which this most significant of constitutional documents was brought to birth.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>THE WIDER PUBLIC: The project website will make freely available newly discovered charters, letters and writs of King John and English translations of the various texts of Magna Carta (1215, 1216, 1217 and 1225) with their associated clause-by-clause commentaries and illustrative primary material (also all in English translation). These will be accompanied by an introduction, aimed at a general readership, to the political, legal and social history of the period, the reign of King John, the making of Magna Carta in 1215, the meaning of Magna Carta, its subsequent re-issues, its enforcement during the reign of King Henry III and its longer-term significance. The website will include a glossary of technical terms, a regular commentary modelled on the 'Fine of the Month' feature that was so successful an aspect of the AHRC-funded Henry III Fine Rolls Project, directed by Professor Carpenter. 

NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL CELEBRATIONS for the 800th Anniversary of Magna Carta (2015): The UK government has already initiated a series of celebrations for the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta. At a ceremony held on 12 November 2010 at the memorial site in Runnymede, the Secretary of State Kenneth Clarke and the Justice Minister Lord McNally both spoke of its enduring relevance in the twenty-first century (http://www.justice.gov.uk/news/newsrelease121110a.htm). As Lord McNally observed, 'The promises Magna Carta contains are as important today as they were in 1215'. The governments of the USA and numerous Commonwealth countries, including Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and many African states acknowledge Magna Carta's influence on their constitutions. The project will make a valuable contribution to national and international celebrations in the following ways:
-The project will contribute to a major exhibition (online and in situ) at the British Library in 2015 which will be part based upon the project's research.
-The project will host a conference in London in 2015, one day of which will be specifically targeted at the general public and at raising public awareness.
-A public launch event will be held at the British Library in June 2015 to which representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom, United States and interested Commonwealth countries will be invited, alongside academics, archivists, librarians, museum curators, students and teachers.
-Professor Vincent will liaise closely with the Magna Carta Trust, through whom discussions are already ongoing for a major television series.

SCHOOLS: The project promises to engage with school pupils of all ages through its work with the Magna Carta Trust. Building upon the success of the 2007 celebrations to mark the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade, and in co-operation with advice from the education secretary, the Rt Hon Michael Gove, MP, and the Department for Education, it is hoped that Magna Carta be taken into schools to raise awareness of its importance. The project website will be of particular value to sixth-form students who are studying modules on medieval England at A'level (OCR, Edexcel and AQA Advanced GCEs in History). The Reign of King John, 1199-1216 (OCR, unit F965), The Angevin Empire, 1154-1216 (Edexcel, History Unit 1 A3), and The Angevin Kings of England: British Monarchy, 1154-1216 (AQA, unit 3: HIS3A) are all modules studied by sixth-form students in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The website will host free learning resources for sixth-formers and their teachers, compiled with the assistance of teachers serving on the project's Knowledge Transfer Advisory Committee. These resources will include readily accessible English translations of Magna Carta, whereby one might click on each clause of Magna Carta and call up a school-level commentary and a range of translated primary material that would enable pupils to research the topic further</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>719165</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Maidstone Library and Archives</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Canterbury Magna Carta celebrations</gtr:description><gtr:id>05F87B4A-060D-4CB2-A9EC-E22A2985CF2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Links with local stakeholders were built and strengthened, and a large general audience in the region engaged with the Magna Carta Project's research about Magna Carta.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Canterbury City Council hosted various events, as did Faversham; Visit Kent promoted events.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Wilkinson was academic adviser for Canterbury's Magna Carta celebrations, Canterbury Magna Carta Celebration Committee, 2012-15.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kent History &amp; Library Centre</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wilkinson, advisor 'Magna Carta Rediscovered' exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B0F4F8D-EAC4-46DE-AE72-552BDD6A359F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Official Visitor Numbers: 30,480 people, excluding the visitor numbers for Rochester cathedral (Source: 'Canterbury and Magna Carta Evaluation Report', Canterbury City Council, page 9)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The various cultural/heritage sites hosted the exhibition; Kent History and Library Centre provided exhibits; Visit Kent promoted the exhibition; it received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Wilkinson was Adviser (by invitation) on historical content to Laura Samuels, curator of the 'Magna Carta Rediscovered' exhibition.

The exhibition included engrossments of two different versions of Magna Carta, together with a collection of other documents from the period, drawn from the Oxford collections. Alongside these Charters was a selection of other contemporary and near-contemporary documents and manuscripts from the Bodleian's rich collection relevant to the history of Magna Carta. These include a late twelfth-century manuscript copy of Henry I's coronation edict of 1100, a contemporary copy of King Stephen's charter of liberties for the English church, and a very interesting, non-chancery copy of the 1215 Magna Carta, possibly transcribed by a clerk in the service of the papal legate Guala and subsequently taken to Italy. Also on display is one of the three surviving manuscripts of Roger of Wendover's chronicle, which is an essential (if partisan) narrative for events in 1215--17. 

Dr Doherty explains the thinking behind the exhibition: 'The exhibition highlights two essential themes in the construction and drafting of Magna Carta. The first---much overlooked in popular narratives on the subject---is the tradition of royal edicts confirming and declaring established (as well as imagined) custom and law. Magna Carta thus stands in a long tradition, and this tradition is illustrated by such examples as Henry I's coronation charter and King Stephen's charter of liberties for the English church. The second theme is the flawed and failed nature of John's kingship and personality. There are thus a number of documents in the exhibition relating to the king himself. Magna Carta was a direct and detailed rejection of his kingship'.

Dr Doherty gave various interviews to the local press in support of the exhibition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Visit Kent</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Canterbury Magna Carta celebrations</gtr:description><gtr:id>E1B59B24-6DAD-41CC-AF6B-17F703BA0E7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Links with local stakeholders were built and strengthened, and a large general audience in the region engaged with the Magna Carta Project's research about Magna Carta.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Canterbury City Council hosted various events, as did Faversham; Visit Kent promoted events.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Wilkinson was academic adviser for Canterbury's Magna Carta celebrations, Canterbury Magna Carta Celebration Committee, 2012-15.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Historical Association</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Magna Carta 800 Committee</gtr:description><gtr:id>1CEEF24E-393A-4E3E-A569-5FD194EF6A0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson's research on Magna Carta was fed into the educational initiatives set up by the Magna Carta Trust for schoolchildren across the globe.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Other partners were also on the committee.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Wilkinson was a member, Academic and Education Sub-Committee, Magna Carta 800 Committee, which co-ordinated the educational initiatives for the 800th anniversary celebrations, and develops learning resources, from 2012-2015.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Jury Room, The Guildhall, Sandwich</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wilkinson, advisor 'Magna Carta Rediscovered' exhibition</gtr:description><gtr:id>B38F3095-A29C-4864-A76A-A3391DBC0E29</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Official Visitor Numbers: 30,480 people, excluding the visitor numbers for Rochester cathedral (Source: 'Canterbury and Magna Carta Evaluation Report', Canterbury City Council, page 9)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The various cultural/heritage sites hosted the exhibition; Kent History and Library Centre provided exhibits; Visit Kent promoted the exhibition; it received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Wilkinson was Adviser (by invitation) on historical content to Laura Samuels, curator of the 'Magna Carta Rediscovered' exhibition.

The first of these was 'Snow White and the Huntsman' (2012), which grossed $396,592,829 worldwide. Following the success of his role here, he was asked to advise on 'Malificent', starring Angevlina Jolie (2014), which grossed $757,628,891 worldwide. This in turn led to his commission as historical advisor on 'Cinderella', directed by Kenneth Branagh, to be released in 2015.

Dr Doherty's role has meant that medieval historical realities have been presented to a vast, international public. For instance, on Doherty's advice, the final scene of 'Snow White' was redrawn to give a historically accurate depiction of a medieval coronation - including the presence of an archbishop, who was played by Doherty himself.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012,2013,2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, Hungarian Embassy talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>60362746-B19B-4E9E-9F87-6FB08BABF62E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent spoke on Magna Carta at a reception at the Hungarian Embassy, London, 5.iii.15, to an audience of 70 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Carpenter, Winchester College</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E41494A9-A7EE-4CDC-908B-89BCF4DD0836</gtr:id><gtr:impact>18th March, Professor Carpenter spoke to students and teachers at Winchester College.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Inaugural lecture</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>514BFAE8-C9E4-4661-A0C7-8A366CF0E216</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson gave her inaugural lecture, 'In Search of Amazons and Viragos: Women in the Age of Magna Carta', at Canterbury Christ Church University 12 February 2015.

Its focus is the region of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire during the reign of King John. It was filmed in the summer of 2014 and research for the programme ran from early 2014 until the end of the first week of November. Nicholas Vincent informed the producer about the existence of two charters of King John (which Professor Vincent had analysed as part of the Magna Carta Project) in the archive of Chatsworth House. As a result, the production company (Wildfire Television) chose to include a section on these charters in the documentary. Sophie Ambler was filmed in discussion with the presenter at Chatsworth, presenting the charters and explaining their significance. This will bring the work of the Project, on the charters of King John, to a large, public audience. Both Hugh Doherty and Sophie Ambler also had significant input into the content of the documentary, providing a great deal of information about the reign of King John as well as interpretations about the origins of Magna Carta. This had a significant impact not only about the level of detail and accuracy in the programme's narrative but on the historical interpretation of King John and his rule presented in the programme. For instance, helping the producer to create a map of the royal forest of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire under King John that could be presented in the programme and explaining the significance of the royal forest in the grievances against John's government that led to Magna Carta; explaining the process by which the king granted charters (such as those featured in the documentary); using the itinerary of King John created by Nicholas Vincent for the Magna Carta Project to give accurate information about the king's style of rule; deploying research gathered for and presented in the clause-by-clause commentaries on Magna Carta on the Project's website, e.g. figures for King John's spending on castles, for use in the programme. The Magna Carta Project and members of the team will be credited in the documentary's titles.

Audience viewing figures will be available after the documentary has aired on 22 November 2014 (previous programmes in the series have attracted an audience of 1 million). It is anticipated that the documentary will prompt an increased number of visits to the Project website. It is also anticipated that the increased publicity for the Project will result in invitations to members of the Project team to give public talks.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.channel4.com/programmes/walking-through-history</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, Northampton Record Society</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>563FCB31-FD40-4506-B125-3E6DC280850B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent spoke in Northampton to the Northampton Record Society, 17.x.15, to an audience of 100 people, on 'Magna Carta'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, Cumberland Lodge</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D13BAAD4-1107-452A-9B8E-7D9C168B214C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent was respondent to the Magna Carta Lecture in Windsor at Cumberland Lodge, 24.vi.15, with an audience of 100 people.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Biography of Joan, daughter of King John, for Magna Carta Trust website, by Prof Louise Wilkinson</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>219156B4-517D-4CE3-9CE2-E6A7DBC3B955</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The biography is part of the 'schools' section of the Magna Carta Trust website, aimed at both school and A-Level students, and the general public.

The context for the event was the high profile discussion amongst policy makers, led by the then education secretary, Michael Gove MP, about the place of Magna Carta in the secondary school history syllabus, a discussion widely publicised and debated in the national media. The meeting enabled Vincent and Breay to inform the Prime Minister about the work of the Magna Carta Project and the British Library exhibition (on which members of the Project are advising).

As a result of the meeting, the Prime Minister was informed about the 800th anniversary celebrations, and about the academic research by the Project, both on its own website and in preparation for the British Library exhibition, that is underpinning renewed public interest in and understanding of the Charter. The event received coverage in the national print media as well as on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, helping to stimulate public awareness of the forthcoming anniversary. As a result of his involvement, Vincent was invited to speak on the Today Programme, which has a weekly audience of circa 7 million listeners.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2014/06/magna-carta-project-at-downing-street.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent Castle Debate</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9A43B1C5-85DF-4CF2-ADED-676F31D711AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent took part in London at a Castle Debate on 'The Forest', 1.vi.15, with an audience of 120 policy makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk by Prof David Carpenter to Trinity College Cambridge History Society (Feb 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2677E8B5-7251-40C6-8461-94853A2A80A6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Carpenter delivered a talk showcasing new research on the Charter to an audience of academics and postgraduate students at Trinity College Cambridge.

The period from June 15 to July 14 2014 saw the number of users rise by 89% from the previous month, and the number of page views rise by 33%.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, advisor to Mark Carney</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2BE361C7-CA85-4EAD-8C6A-61CB1AC00D6F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent acted as advisor to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, for a lecture he gave at Lincoln Cathedral.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/speeches/2015/832.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, Essen, Anglo-Deutsch Gessellschaft</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0FB5AA9A-2032-46D3-8514-03FC24CDB4D6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent spoke in Essen, t a meeting of the Anglo-Deutsch Gessellschaft, on 5.v.15, to an audience of 50 people, on 'Magna Carta'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article for L'Histoire: Collections 59 (April 2013),  'Les Barons jouent et gagnent', by Prof Nicholas Vincent</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>853E3E13-CFB6-49D4-B687-A86158E46911</gtr:id><gtr:impact>L'Histoire is one of the best-selling popular history magazines in France, with a circulation of around 55,000.

The audience consisted of over 250 members of the public, who responded enthusiastically to the lecture.

As a result of this talk, and of relationship built between members of the Magna Carta Project and key stakeholders in Lincoln, several members of the Project have been invited to speak at a major conference in Lincoln in April 1215 on Magna Carta, hosted by the Lincoln Record Society.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appearance on the Today Programme, BBC Radio 4, by Prof Nicholas Vincent (June 2014)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C05E85BD-9D2A-4D20-864B-0238E15FED2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent was invited to speak on the Today Programme about Magna Carta and the celebrations for the 800th anniversary, as a result of his invitation to attend the Prime Minister's reception for Magna Carta anniversary stakeholders at Downing Street, in June 2014, which received wide coverage in the national media. The appearance involved a lively debate with a fellow interviewee, Professor David Starkey, on the significance of Magna Carta today. The Today Programme boasts a weekly audience of circa 7 million listeners.

As a result of Professor Vincent's interview on the Today Programme, and the wide media coverage of Magna Carta's 799th anniversary and the Prime Minister's reception at Downing Street, there was a significant increase in traffic to the Magna Cara Project website.

The Debate involves sixth form students from across the country, who compete in regional heats, with the final to take place at RHUL in March 2014. Each entrant will talk about Magna Carta or can pick an event, object, document, building, individual or group and explain why it has made an impact on their personal civil liberties, why it has wider historical significance and why it is more significant for them than Magna Carta. As a result of his work on the Magna Carta Project, and his strong links with the Historical Association, Dr Doherty was invited to act as a guest judge in the Norwich heat.

The exhibition included engrossments of two different versions of Magna Carta, together with a collection of other documents from the period. Alongside these Charters was a selection of other contemporary and near-contemporary documents and manuscripts from the Bodleian's rich collection relevant to the history of Magna Carta. These include a late twelfth-century manuscript copy of Henry I's coronation edict of 1100, a contemporary copy of King Stephen's charter of liberties for the English church, and a very interesting, non-chancery copy of the 1215 Magna Carta, possibly transcribed by a clerk in the service of the papal legate Guala and subsequently taken to Italy. Also on display is one of the three surviving manuscripts of Roger of Wendover's chronicle, which is an essential (if partisan) narrative for events in 1215--17. 

Dr Doherty explains the thinking behind the exhibition: 'The exhibition highlights two essential themes in the construction and drafting of Magna Carta. The first---much overlooked in popular narratives on the subject---is the tradition of royal edicts confirming and declaring established (as well as imagined) custom and law. Magna Carta thus stands in a long tradition, and this tradition is illustrated by such examples as Henry I's coronation charter and King Stephen's charter of liberties for the English church. The second theme is the flawed and failed nature of John's kingship and personality. There are thus a number of documents in the exhibition relating to the king himself. Magna Carta was a direct and detailed rejection of his kingship'.

Dr Doherty gave various interviews to the local press in support of the exhibition.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/magna-carta-exhibition-at-weston-library.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, interview for Online Library of Economics and Liberty</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C033358F-2F90-4B24-B1DF-3C5345C97946</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent gave an interview for the Online Library of Economics and Liberty, 18.v.15, with Russ Roberts, which has had 100,000+ hits from the US and across the globe.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2015/05/nicholas_vincen.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Carpenter, Salisbury: Stanford University Summer School</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF8FFE26-5903-4568-88EF-791D54CB25BE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>25th August, Professor Carpenter spoke in Salisbury at Stanford University Summer School.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Ambler, Carpenter, Vincent, Peking University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>13FA512E-3F55-4E84-8033-34845C2EB5C3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Ambler and Professors Carpenter and Vincent took part in an Anglo-Chinese Conference at Peking University, Beijing, organised by the Institute of Historical Resesarch, 9-11.ix.15, giving talks to an audience of 50 people, including Chinese historians and students.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, Taunton HA talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>82F1214D-877C-48C9-88EF-B5E6FC520EBC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent spoke in Taunton, at Queen's School, to the local Historical Association branch, on 14.i.15, to an audience of 120 people on 'Magna Carta'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wilkinson,'The Magna Carta Journey' with Rod Whiting, BBC Radio Lincolnshire</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2E26D11E-F1E4-4534-AE10-A92411D530AC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson was a contributor on 'The Magna Carta Journey' with Rod Whiting, BBC Radio Lincolnshire, 09 June 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03c7f3x</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, New York Times</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB1D21FD-2DA1-4937-8002-D7161ED5C06C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Vincent was interviewed for the New York Times, 12.vi.15, making 'Quote of the Day' 15.vi.15 - a circulation of almost. 1,400,000.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Biography of archbishop Stephen Langton for Magna Carta Trust website, by Dr Sophie Ambler</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D0C8DAE5-0930-4639-A827-D7952299261C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The biography is part of the 'schools' section of the Magna Carta Trust website, aimed at both school and A-Level students, and the general public.

The content of the site is a major platform for the communication of the Project's work with the general public, academics and schools. Since the site was set up in October 2013, it has been visited by over 2,000 users, receiving over 13,600 page views. With a significant increase in content in the period September - November 1214, traffic to the site has increased markedly, with the number of page views up 148% on the previous three month period. Around 70% of this traffic is from UK visitors, with a significant number of visitors from the USA, Brazil, France, Australia, Canada and Germany, with a number of visits also from users in Italy, Spain and Japan.

As a result of the engagement of key stakeholders with the Magna Carta Project website, members of the Project team have been invited to collaborate with other organisations. For instance, Dr Sophie Ambler was invited to contribute articles on Magna Carta, and the role of Magna Carta in the development of parliament, to a book in production by the History of Parliament Trust (to be published in 2015), and to speak at the History of Parliament Trust's major international conference, in June 2015.

'King John's Diary' (the week by week detailed account of the king's activities during the crucial period surrounding the issuing of Magna Carta), written by Professor Vincent, has now been completed up to mid-January 1216 (approximately 130,000 words), together with the king's itinerary (the record of his day-to-day journeys across the kingdom, plotted by Professor Vincent from government records), taking readers through to the civil war that followed John's rejection of the Charter. For a large part of the diary (which begins in February 1214) users are also now able to plot John's itinerary on a map, thanks to the development of mapping software by Mr Geoffrey French with colleagues at the University of Cambridge.

Since December 2014, thirty new Features of the Month have been added, making for a total of nearly forty since the project's inception. These have been written by members of the project team, as well as by outside colleagues and doctoral students. The Features make available, to a broad audience, new discoveries made by the project and new research, as well as providing many primary sources in translation for the first time for the benefit of A-Level and undergraduate students. That the project team has been able to provide this quantity of new research - which far exceeds what was anticipated - is testament to the extraordinary amount of research undertaken and new discoveries made by the project. Several of these discoveries emerged from research trips to Europe and the USA, not least the two remarkable baronial seals discovered independently, in two Pennsylvania library collections.

The website continues to be a popular resource for scholars, Magna Carta stakeholders, students and the general public across the world. The main site has drawn almost 54,000 page views since December 2014 (as of 07/03/16), with the blog attracting almost 23,000 page views. Approximately 53% of visits to the site have come from outside the United Kingdom: 27% from the USA, and 4.5% from Australia and Canada, with several hundred visits each from China, France, Germany, Brazil and Japan.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Comment by Prof Nicholas Vincent and Prof Louise Wilkinson to international media on sale of 'Magna Carta Island'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0C8F2022-89AD-4C5F-9AC0-D7146D66015B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Nicholas Vincent was quoted in the Wall Street Journal on 17 July about a private island on the Thames that had recently come up for sale.

Vincent's comments potentially reached the Wall Street Journal's average daily readership of 2.4 million. Further comments were provided by Louise Wilkinson to the Independent, which enjoyed a daily circulation in July 2014 of 63,000.

The Debate involves sixth form students from across the country, who compete in regional heats, with the final to take place at RHUL in March 2014. Each entrant will talk about Magna Carta or can pick an event, object, document, building, individual or group and explain why it has made an impact on their personal civil liberties, why it has wider historical significance and why it is more significant for them than Magna Carta. As a result of her high profile work on Magna Carta, and strong relationship with the Historical Association, Professor Wilkinson was invited to join the panel of judges in the Canterbury heat, which involves some twenty students, with their teachers and parents in the audience. Professor Wilkinson helped to stimulate discussion on the Charter and helped students to develop their arguments, as well as judging the entrants.

As part of a national network, this event helped to increase interest in and engagement with the Charter amongst sixth form students, involve the students with the anniversary celebrations in 2015, and potentially to influence the students' pursuit of this subject at university level.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.history.org.uk/news/news_2183.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Vincent, worldwide coverage of discovery of a Magna Carta in Kent</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E2B5D08-567C-4859-8632-93164CF5FD03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of research for the Magna Carta Project, a previously unknown exemplar of the 1300 Magna Carta was discovered in the Sandwich archive in Maidstone.

It attracted an interested audience of approximately 150 for each of the three days (a very large audience for conferences of this type), including many members of the general public as well as undergraduate and graduate students and academic colleagues. On the third day, at the British Library, the A Level History class from Bethnal Green Academy also attended with their teacher, and had the opportunity to see the Magna Carta exhibition. 

The conference included, on the first evening, a reception at King's Maughan Library in which the J.C. Holt Undergraduate Essay Prize was awarded. This was a competition set up by the Magna Carta Project to encourage undergraduate students in the study of Magna Carta, and especially to utilise the resources provided by the project website. The prize was awarded jointly to two undergraduates (one History, one Law), and was presented by Melvyn Bragg. The reception also saw the launch of the third addition of Sir James Holt's Magna Carta, edited by Professors George Garnett and John Hudson (who introduced the edition at the reception), as well as a eulogy for Sir James Holt delivered by Professor Daniel Power. 

The second evening saw a private viewing of the Magna Carta exhibition at the British Library for conference attendees. This was introduced by Dr Breay, who explained her role in curating the exhibition and how the Magna Carta Project's work had informed its preparation.

It is accompanied by a 'diary' for King John, giving a detailed narrative of events in each week. This feature was added to the site in September 2014 and has so far it has received 660 page views.

This feature represents a significant contribution to new research on the reign of King John, providing a narrative of John's reign in the year leading up to the issue of Magna Carta that is unparalleled in depth and accuracy. As with all areas of the website, a citation tool is provided to allow ready citation. The diary and itinerary elicit considerable engagement on social media, and are expected to attract an increasingly large audience as we approach the 2015 anniversary, especially as more stakeholders (especially those of the 'Magna Carta Towns') are made aware of this feature.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.org/read/itinerary</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Friends of Canterbury Archaeological Trust</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8909E154-1158-4397-B400-054FD48BA814</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson was invited to talk on 'Women in the Age of Magna Carta' by the Friends of Canterbury Archaeological Trust, 25 March 2015.

The understanding of the audience members about the origins and development of Norman and French law was transformed, which has led to a change in the way they teach the topic, as they will now include in their teaching content discussion of the place of Magna Carta in Norman law. They also were encouraged to engage with the 800th anniversary celebrations in 2015 and the work of the Magna Carta Project on the origins of the Charter's clauses, presented on the Project's website in the clause-by-clause commentary on Magna Carta.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Biography of Isabella of Angoul?me for Magna Carta Trust website, by Prof Louise Wilkinson</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18410983-23D5-449D-8606-552A2E634B09</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The biography is part of the 'schools' section of the Magna Carta Trust website, aimed at both school and A-Level students, and the general public.

As the chief ongoing research project in Magna Carta's 800th anniversary year, the project and its team dealt with a great array of media interest and excited an extraordinary degree of public interest. They advised such bodies as the Australian Senate, the National Archives in Washington, and the BBC. They ran a series of media stories (Sunday Times, Times, Guardian, and thence international media) emerging from new discoveries, including an entirely unknown Magna Carta brought to light in February 2015. In June 2015, in the full glare of international media attention, they revealed the identities of the scribes who physically wrote the charters of 2015. From March to September 2015, they helped stage a major international exhibition in London, opened by the Prince of Wales and visited by more than 130,000 paying members of the public. One project member served as historical advisor to two Hollywood blockbusters which together grossed in excess of $1 billion. A Downing Street reception organised in June 2014 saw two other members of the project entertained by the Prime Minister. There have since been meetings at Buckingham Palace, and elsewhere, with the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and other members of the Royal Family. Project members flew to America (visiting at least a dozen states), to China, to Armenia, Australia, Germany, Mexico, Russia and elsewhere, giving public lectures or broadcasts in several cases directly sponsored by the British Foreign Office. Articles written by project members appeared across the world's media, including the New York Times (Quote of the Day, for the Magna Carta anniversary of 15 June 2015), and the mass circulation daily newspapers of Brazil and India. All told, six project members were involved in a collective total approaching 400 public speaking engagements in 2015, addressing audiences that ranged from the local to the truly international. The project also published at least five significant monographs and a great number of articles, many of them appearing in 2015. Its flagship website, with something approaching three quarters of a million words now online, became the leading forum for the dissemination of new research on Magna Carta, widely used by scholars and the general public around the world. The various impact strands here can be traced via the individual collaborations, partnerships and engagement activities listed below. Few other research projects, let alone research projects in medieval history, can claim this degree either of exposure or of potential public impact.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>61C1FA83-08AC-483D-A833-AA291C5B5845</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Magna Carta is perhaps the most famous document in the English speaking world. Yet its background, context and subsequent uses have never before been properly explored. In this, a project designed to culminate in the 800th anniversary year 2015, Magna Carta has been exposed to a whole series of new investigations. Over 250 archives have been searched, across Britain, Europe and the United States. The project team has produced five new books and a whole series of articles or online publications. Highly significant new documents have been brought to light, many of them first released to the public in 2015. Four new originals of the Forest Charter (Magna Carta's less well-known cousin) have been discovered, and an entirely new Magna Carta (found in Kent). The project unearthed the publication schedule for Magna Carta (in Lambeth Palace Library, article in the Times, July 2015), and a previously unknown treaty between King John and Scotland (in The National Archives, article in the Guardian, March 2015). It also revealed the true identity of one of the iconic Magna Cartas in the British Library (a charter first granted to Canterbury Cathedral). In June 2015, the project broadcast its finding that two of the four iconic charters of 1215 (those at Salisbury and Lincoln) were in fact written by episcopal rather than royal scribes (Sunday Times front page). This has major significance for our understanding of the charter's making, publication and purpose. The project has enjoyed extensive exposure to the media, both broadcast and printed. Project members have gone on to advise public bodies in the UK, the USA and Australia, including the Australian Senate and the American Library of Congress.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Following the grand climax of 2015, there remain many questions that cry out for exploration. These include the use and significance of royal letters, especially of the confirmations of Magna Carta after 1215, the modern reception of Magna Carta, and the meaning of the document to the modern age. The project website remains a live resource, with materials added regularly throughout the first few months of 2016, and with the expectation that it will continue to be augmented hereafter. The major online features on original charters, and on the Itinerary and life of King John will be continued through to the King's death in October 1216. Project members continue to be consulted as the leading scholarly advisors on Magna Carta, and collaborations with the British Foreign Office in 2015 have led to a number of further invitations, to America and elsewhere. Many of the resources created in 2015 remain active online and continue to be widely consulted. The project produced half a dozen books and a large number of articles, widely and enthusiastically received.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>F01C64E4-4F03-47BE-8779-D790AA4F8A6E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Wilkinson, Key Stage 3 material</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9DE9B4AB-F93D-4AFC-8880-81DDA04B4058</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Wilkinson, Magna Carta Schools Educational Resource Book, Key Stage 3 (Canterbury Christ Church University, 2015), 1-29 pp.; printed with the assistance of the Canterbury Christ Church University Outreach Team and Department of Marketing, Design and Production.

Several of these discoveries emerged from research trips to Europe and the USA, not least the two remarkable baronial seals discovered independently, in two Pennsylvania library collections.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5400E450-3895-4037-9FE3-4C55686A4576</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Features of the Month continue to be an important resource to scholars, students and the general public - to date (08/03/16) they've received over 7,200 page views.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Features of the Month</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.org/read/feature_of_the_month</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Dr Summerson has now completed his allotted quota of Magna Carta clause commentaries for the Magna Carta Project website, with each clause available in three versions (for schools, the general public and academics).

These originals are scattered across archives in Britain and France and have not previously been readily accessible to historians, and have never previously been gathered together as a coherent resource. The Project is bringing together these 300 or so originals and presenting them on the Project website with digital images, descriptions, transcriptions and calendars. The transcriptions are indexed, allowing users to search the data base by person, place and date. This data base represents a significant contribution to scholarship, allowing researchers to analyse the scripts and practices of the royal chancery at the time of Magna Carta, to detect the relationship between these issues and the four surviving original Magna Cartas of 1215, and to compare these originals with the versions enrolled in the records of central government (it is upon these enrolled versions that historians have hitherto relied). For this purpose, the transcriptions are fully annotated, demonstrating the variations between the original and enrolled versions of the charters, as well as between the original and any copies.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BEAA187F-DE6C-45C4-9521-569110CED1F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work of editing and uploading the charters is ongoing but already the value of this data base has been demonstrated. For instance, the comparison of these original charters with their enrolled version has shown significant discrepancies, with important implications for our understanding of the workings of the royal chancery as well as for our narrative of the reign (as a result of discrepancies in dating and witness lists).</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Original Charters of King John</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://magnacartaresearch.org/read/original_charters</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>'King John's Diary' (the week by week detailed account of the king's activities during the crucial period surrounding the issuing of Magna Carta), written by Professor Vincent, has now been completed up to mid-January 1216 (approximately 130,000 words), together with the king's itinerary (the record of his day-to-day journeys across the kingdom, plotted by Professor Vincent from government records), taking readers through to the civil war that followed John's rejection of the Charter.
