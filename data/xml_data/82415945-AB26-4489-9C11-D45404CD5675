This project aims to unpack such conventions by reviewing evidence from a range of sources and disciplines of the historical impacts of slavery and colonialism on the British countryside, including evidence on black lives and their integration into rural society. It also seeks to examine the social dynamics surrounding the production and reception of such histories and to develop further opportunities for engagement with them. Collective notions of identity, expressed as community, are important frames for both rural and black groups. However, as appeals to community can be used to separate as well as connect people this project aims to understand how the term is used in historical and contemporary contexts and the material effects of its deployment. Knowledge of these historical presences, connections and legacies in rural Britain is patchy, and sites in the eastern part of the country have been especially neglected.

There are three main elements to the project. Firstly a review of academic, agency and third sector literature on: a) histories both of black and ethnic minority presences and of slavery and colonialism in rural Britain, c.1600-1939; and b) recent public heritage initiatives. Secondly archival scoping to create a summary database of collections relating to black and ethnic minority presence and the histories of slavery and colonialism in the rural East Midlands and East Anglia, c.1600-1939, identifying any related public heritage work in these regions today. Thirdly a series of four workshops to bring together academics, heritage and museum professionals, local authority heritage/outreach officials, 'community' group representatives and wider publics to exchange information and reflect on the issues surrounding the public representation of such histories. This would involve the challenges of repositioning conventionally powerful groups, including those whose histories offer contrasting philanthropic and enslavement narratives, as well as the presentation of subaltern stories in ways which can be integrated into heritage sites in a practical way. An advisory group comprised of academic, agency and third sector representatives will provide expert advice throughout the duration of the project. These activities will enable more reflective and contextualised collaborative relationships between academics, heritage organisations and diverse publics over histories and legacies of slavery and colonialism in rural Britain.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Enabling knowledge exchange with stakeholders beyond UK academia, the proposed project has the capacity for cultural, social and economic impact on a local, regional and national scale. In particular, it has the potential for impact within the rural heritage sector, and amongst groups promoting the wider social welfare of black and minority ethnic groups. Key stakeholders in the project, representatives of whom have already been invited, include:

i) National policy makers, most notably English Heritage, a key government agency which advises on policy and manages a range of historic rural property, but also bodies such as the Rural Communities Policy Unit of Defra.
ii) UK local authorities, which manage historic properties and run county archive, museum and community outreach activities.
iii) The UK third sector, including charitable organizations promoting the rights and interests of black and ethnic minority communities in Britain (e.g. the Black and Asian Studies Association), charities which manage historic properties (e.g. The National Trust), and those which represent rural communities (e.g. Action with Communities in Rural England, the umbrella body for the Rural Community Action Network). 
iv) Privately-owned rural heritage sites and businesses, such as Thoresby Park, Nottinghamshire.
v) Diverse publics, especially rural communities in Britain, including local history and parish groups, such as Diaspora Norfolk and Nottinghamshire Local History Association.

Bringing together such a diverse range of stakeholders, the project has been designed to enhance the effectiveness of public policy in the rural heritage and rural community spheres by providing new information, new expertise networks and further coordination of activities. In particular, it will support the more effective achievement of equality policy and access for black and minority ethnic groups in local authorities and charities which manage rural heritage sites.

On another level it will also directly benefit the particular individuals and organizations represented within the advisory group (see collaborating activities document), as well as those invited to participate in the consultation and development workshops. In particular it will enable skills development for a variety of stakeholders. So, for example, as well as inviting senior representatives from heritage organizations, such as English Heritage, who may be in a position to influence and/or implement policy change, we also intend to include front-of-house staff from Rufford Abbey in the community workshops, since it is such staff who face the public and their questions. More broadly, the project will enable provision of information on how to find relevant materials on this topic and the development of networking skills with diverse groups and publics.

In the longer term, the project have been designed to further impact upon public understandings of black presences and the histories of slavery and colonialism in rural Britain by encouraging reflective and contextualised collaborative relationships between academics, heritage organisations and diverse publics in projects concerned with the representation of black histories and the legacies of slavery and colonialism in rural Britain. It will achieve this by:
i) Facilitating access to the range of research and archive sources summarized by the scoping review and to experts in the field.
ii) Enabling networking between established groups and stakeholders.
iii) Creating new connections between existing but previously unlinked groups.
iv) Encouraging new people to become involved in this interest area.

Finally, the project has the potential for impact on an international scale, since it is likely to be of interest to scholars and other stakeholders in countries with comparable slavery and colonial histories and legacies to Britain, and who face similar challenges in integrating these histories within heritage sites.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36088</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Hindu Samaj Sheffield &amp; District</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Sheffield Hindu Samaj Heritage group</gtr:description><gtr:id>5C3F5F59-8A96-4725-87EB-F9039F481958</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The main outputs of this collaboration are:

Specific challenges the day sought to address were: how can the achievements of a project be sustained and built upon after the main period of funding has ended? how can people brought together through a particular project continue their collaboration? how can the resources/materials generated be effectively managed into the future? The strategy was to bring together a range of people interested in Black heritage research to share and discuss the work they have undertaken so far, including collaborations involved, the challenges faced and successes achieved, and ways of moving forward. The workshop included sessions on sharing past achievements in which six people/groups presented (some academic, some community), discussing experiences, successes and challenges of university-community collaborations, sharing ideas on sustaining and managing people and resources beyond project funding, sharing new research ideas and suggesting ways forward. The format was designed to allow participants to engage actively in presentations and smaller-scale discussions and a research 'speed-dating' session was held. . Twenty-one people participated in total, including members of the African diaspora, volunteers from Heritage Lottery fund projects, university academics, and a HLF representative. The event succeeded in bringing different groups and individuals together, some of whom had previously collaborated, others who had not, and was experimental in this respect. This included making links between those with project ideas and potential funders. A proposal was taken to the Institute of Commonwealth Studies for a Nottingham workshop as part of their series 'What's Happening in Black British History?' but the organisers were not able to commit to this as part of their programme at that time. Notes from the meeting were circulated to participants. Subsequent developments have been the emergence of the Nottingham Black History Society (2016) which is supported by some of those attending this workshop and the securing of funding for a BAME Community History and Heritage Representation day event (7 June 2016) hosted by University of Nottingham and the New Art Exchange Nottingham.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Display stand at Scence in the Park Festival, Castleton 1 Nov 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF4818F4-4A1E-4E91-A093-BCEED5C97FA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Stand sparked interest from visitors who asked questions and took away information.

Some expressed concern at the possibility of pushing certain connections too far when empirical evidence is lacking. Others saw an opportunity to consider parallels between practices and experiences of indentured and enslaved labour with the caution to avoid approaches which may inadvertently 'equalise' slavery and indenture. Many heritage and museum sector professionals and volunteers were interested in exploring these kinds of connections further and embedding them within their work. They favoured developing interpretive work through the lives of particular individuals, some suggesting a move away from narratives of heroic 'great men' or villains and 'oppressed masses' to a more nuanced and contextualised heritage interpretation. Another view was that a neutral position on the legacies of slavery and colonialism is not possible: if we think it's wrong we should say so.

This workshop led directly to the development of the Global Cotton Connections project. 
Some of the people who attended have been engaged with further as part of the GCC project, notably the Arkwight Society and Cromford Mill guides.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/isos/research/rural-legacies.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Press release: New Project information on the University of Nottingham's Institute for the Study of Slavery website, 9th March 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2A37EE40-BF12-4BD1-8F0C-5E2F96EB5A05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press release sparked interest from ISOS colleagues.

These were held on Saturday 20th June 2015 at Cromford Mills under the title 'Global Cotton Connections: Creative Encounters'. The purpose was to share a range of GCC-related outputs, particularly those produced by the associated community groups, with general public visitors to Cromford Mills and wider diverse communities bussed in from Nottingham and Sheffield. Activities involved three sessions (10am, 12noon and 2pm) of the 'Global Cotton Connections: Untangling the Threads of Slavery' film show and 'British Raj in the Peak District: Threads of Connection' poetry readings hosted by the Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group and Sheffield Hindu Samaj cultural group held in the Exhibition room at Cromford Mills. This room also displayed wider materials produced as part of the Global Cotton Connections project, including a poster created by the Sheffield Hindu Samaj group also drawing on their HLF project work, and work on textiles from the AHRC Legacies of Rural Slavery and Colonialism scoping project. These events were attended by about 25 members of the wider public (including some volunteer mill guides) and around 55 people of mainly African Caribbean or Indian heritage background associated with the wider Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies group, facilitated by Bright Ideas Nottingham, and the Sheffield Hindu Samaj cultural group, brought to the site by coach. These participants also had the opportunity to take guided tours at Cromford and Belper. They were asked to identify the main things they gained from the day. Most (27 out of 44, 10 from Nottingham, 17 from Sheffield) referred to gaining new knowledge of the cotton mills or cotton industry more broadly, with reference to cotton connections (6 mentions) particularly between the mills and India (4 mentions), cotton origins (2 mentions) and the role of the slave trade (2 mentions). A number of participants (7), mostly from the Nottingham group, highlighted gains from sharing, solidarity and meeting like-minded people. A small number (3) referred to the rewards of seeing the impact of their research projects in the mill venues. Comments from the general public were positive and included 'great to hear the 'hidden' histories'; 'inspiring'; 'excellent experience'; 'wanted more!'.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://globalcottonconnections.wordpress.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Development workshop: Rural Community Histories: Legacies of slavery and colonialism and the country house (28 July 2012, Rufford Abbey, Nottinghamshire)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>590FC6FA-D402-4019-837A-0DA4076B592B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The day's presentations and activities prompted significant, and at times heated, discussion amongst participants. This revealed one key area of potential conflict amongst visitors to country houses: how (or even if) such narratives should be incorporated into these historic sites. In particular, there was a concern that we may be at risk of appearing to overstate these connections, to the detriment of other aspects of country estates, and some audiences may be put off if they perceive a quasi-political agenda overshadowing historical 'fact'. Most agreed however that rather than shy away from 'difficult' legacies, it is important to try and normalise them within a country house's interpretation. Temporary, stand-alone exhibitions or displays it was generally felt would not suffice and could exacerbate anxiety about acknowledging such connections. Instead participants called for an interpretative approach that incorporated narratives about colonial connections in a more holistic, less headline, manner.

Preparation of material for this day and feedback from participants helped inform Susanne Seymour's involvement in The Colour of Money HLF project visit to Newstead Abbey with the Nottingham Slave Trade Legacies volunteers.
Discussions are currently under way with the relevant museum services staff to enhance coverage of the slavery connections of Newstead Abbey at the site.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/isos/research/rural-legacies.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Media interest: BBC Radio Nottingham 29 July 2012</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DB01FCA4-A334-497D-8A62-DFAC08C8B9E3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview sparked some audience feedback and encouraged attendance at public workshops.

Country estates and particular professions such as the military and music were found to be associated with stronger levels of Black presences. It also highlighted a considerable range of historic colonial and slavery linkages in the UK countryside from direct ownership of enslaved people and land (associated with country estates and ports in particular) and colonial service connections to indirect links through products such as rural textiles or abolitionist or anti-colonial sympathies. 
The scoping study also revealed only limited engagement in the literature and in heritage venues with rural legacies of slavery, colonialism and Black presences. Country houses have received most academic attention though some has been paid to the wider countryside. By contrast most heritage venues have been slow to engage with these legacies, with some evidence of urban proximity and west country location encouraging more engagement. A strong message is the continuing BAME disillusion with heritage venues' lack of engagement with these histories and legacies.
Posters and leaflets have been created in relation to country estate and rural textile venues. Summaries of events held are available on the project website. 
The archival scoping has resulted in on-line mapping of a range of colonial, slavery and Black presence linkages for three rural counties in the east of Britain: Angus, Norfolk and Nottinghamshire. These are available on the project website.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Identification of research gaps for future research to address.
