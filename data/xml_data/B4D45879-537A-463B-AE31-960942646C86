exposure from waste water treatment work effluents?</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K004263/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Major worldwide attention has focused on the observations of disruptions of reproduction in both wildlife and human populations that can result from exposure to chemicals that interfere with the body's hormone signalling systems (so-called endocrine disrupting chemicals; EDCs) impacting on reproductive health. We have shown that reproduction in fish (roach, a common member of the carp family of fish) living in many UK Rivers has been damaged by exposure to EDCs contained in the wastewater treatment works (WwTW) effluents and the chemicals responsible for these effects include natural oestrogen hormones and pharmaceutical oestrogens in the contraceptive pill. 
Feminised roach have a reduced capability to breed under competitive breeding conditions and we have evidence (as yet, unpublished) for reduced breeding population sizes in wild roach living in rivers with a high effluent content. Populations with low numbers of breeding individuals lose genetic variation over multiple generations with a greater risk of extinction. Nevertheless, we find that in some stretches of these rivers with high oestrogenic exposure roach populations appear to be reproductively self-sustaining. Establishing whether fish (here roach) have adapted to oestrogenic contaminants, how they do this (the mechanisms) and the possible fitness costs of these adaptations are essential in understanding resilience (and thus sustainability) of fish populations living in these polluted environments.
We will examine whether exposure of roach populations to oestrogenic WwTW effluents over multiple generations has resulted in genetic selection and the impacts of selection on the susceptibility in male fish to develop oestrogen-induced effects associated with negative fitness consequences. We will examine for selection by identifying functionally significant changes in their genetic make up. Specifically we will look for differences in genetic poylmorphisms (so called single nucleotide polymorphisms -SNPs) in (1) specific (candidate) genes that we know are important in oestrogen signalling of reproductive (and other life) processes and (2) by using methods that allow us to scan the whole genome for these genetic alterations (using a technique called RAD-tag genotyping). Adopting these methods we expect to find 'footprints' of selection in fish living in rivers with a high oestrogenic effluent content, which should allow identification of novel adaptive processes and suggest important mechanisms of toxicity or survival in effluent rich environments. Uniquely, we are able to do this work because we have in depth knowledge (15 years of study) of the wild populations of roach in the selected UK Rivers that we propose to study.
We will establish whether roach populations exposed to high levels of oestrogenic effluent over many generations have adapted to become less responsive to environmental oestrogens and thus are now less susceptible to their associated adverse effects by comparing responses to a controlled exposure to the contraceptive oestrogen, ethinyloestradiol. We will use roach collected from the same clean and WwTW effluent contaminated sites as for the population genetic analyses described above and fish will be exposed for a period of 1 year and effects quantified on responses that have negative fitness consequences in male fish, including ovotestis. 
This work is intended to greatly improve understanding of the ability of fish to adapt to exposure to environmental pollutants (here oestrogen) and how they do so, in turn helping to inform on fish population resilience in UK rivers receiving WwTW effluent discharges. The work will have importance in the regulation of discharges for the better protection of our aquatic resources and biodiversity and is of very wide interest to the government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, industry and the wider public.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) potentially have very wide-reaching deleterious environmental impacts and our findings will be of considerable interest (inter)nationally to academia, pharmaceutical and chemical industries, government regulatory bodies, environment protection groups, and the wider public. The major part of our impact activities will be centred on training, engagement with industry partners and (inter)national government regulatory bodies, and informing the wider public.

The approach we propose in this proposal will apply advanced molecular techniques to provide an advanced understanding on the ability of fish to adapt to oestrogenic EDCs, how they do this and the fitness consequences of these adaptations. We expect the work to benefit, both nationally and internationally industry and government regulatory bodies, by supporting evidence-based decision-making on EDCs, a large group of academic researchers working in similar or related fields and by advancing the use of cutting edge molecular and genome methods and understanding adaptive (evolutionary) processes; the water and chemical (including pharmaceutical) industries through better understanding the implications of exposure to EDCs on wildlife health allowing industry to consider remediation strategy options, including additional treatment technologies; fisheries managers, as widespread adaptation would influence management of fish using hatchery stock; NGOs and the public, who will benefit from better evidence of EDC effects on wildlife and that may also affect their own health. 

At this time we do not see that this project has any IP with immediate industrial application. If such an opportunity arises however (e.g. in the discovery of molecular biomarkers) we will gain direct support on commercialisation opportunities and be provided with advice on the protection of IP through our University's Research &amp;amp; Knowledge Transfer sections.

The project team has a strong record in public engagement and outreach activities and will make active use of our respective university press offices to maximise publicity opportunities to ensure the results of our work are widely disseminated. The PIs and RCo-I will also participate in a number of public events and scientific discussions on environmental pollution and these will include; the annual National Science and Engineering Week at Exeter, Cafe Scientifique at Exeter, presentations at national and regional levels to the Association of River Trusts, the Environment Agency Fisheries Teams, Natural England and the European Commission. Both PIs participate actively in a series of school-focused events and in higher education programmes at 'Public Open Days' and take on work experience students in their laboratories.

Both RCo-I and RA recruited to this project will be expected to contribute substantially to the communication activities. The RCo-I and RA will attend a NERC training course on science communication. We will ensure that all personnel recruited to this projected are provided with the opportunity to develop their awareness of, and skills in, science communication and knowledge transfer by; a) designating them major roles in the organization and running of the proposed SETAC and Exeter workshops (including as a presenter); b) encouraging the RCo-I and RA to author articles for the popular press and to engage in public discussion related events outlined above; c) working with university publicity team to design project website and briefing leaflets.

Key measures of success will be in the delivery of high quality science with high impact, as evidenced by publication of the work in the best peer reviewed scientific journals, workshop participation and delivery, disseminations at internationally leading events (scientific, government, regulatory), and uptake of this work into these sectors and influence on policy development for EDCs</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>387021</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Brunel University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Institute of Environment, Health and Societies</gtr:department><gtr:description>Brunel/EA/CEH/NBAF - NE/K004263/1</gtr:description><gtr:id>A3642691-2ABB-449F-9225-4402849B997A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>as above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project was conducted in collaboration with Professor Jobling's research group at Brunel University.

We investigated evidence of adaptation by conducting an analysis of genetic variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) in wild roach populations from both polluted and clean river stretches, developing significant knowledge on the importance of chemical exposure on selection in roach populations. A literature review identified 65 genes in which variants could potentially alter sensitivity to oestrogen exposure. SNPs were identified in these genes by remapping raw sequence reads to the assembled transcriptome or by Sanger sequencing. Genotyping of roach from nine locations in collaboration with NERC Biomolecular Analysis Facility at Sheffield (NBAF-S) provided genotypes for 217 SNPs, including in 87 SNPs in 36 candidate genes (e.g. oestrogen receptors, VTGs), 9 SNPs in three candidates for being under selection for reasons other than oestrogen exposure and 121 SNPs each in a different random protein coding gene. Genetic outlier analysis identified several of these genes as under selection in roach population including Cyp1A1 and the androgen receptor (detailed in key findings).

We also optimised methods for RAD-seq genotyping to conduct genome-wide sequencing of roach in order to investigate adaptive responses to effluent exposure. We have constructed RAD-seq libraries from six populations and analysed two in detail, identifying a suite of genes with strong signatures of having undergone selection in polluted rivers (detailed in key findings).

We also conducted population genetic analysis using DNA microsatellite data to provide additional information on population genetic structure and the history of roach in each river. This provided key information on the effectiveness of obstructions such as weirs at restricting movements of roach within rivers and has provided novel knowledge on population genetic structure of roach in UK rivers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E198F829-2043-48FA-9BBF-3C9E4A0FE172</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>?

To investigate evidence for adaption in roach we compared responses to oestrogen exposure in the offspring fish derived from rivers which differ in their exposure to oestrogenic effluent. Our completed analysis suggests that the river of origin of the parent fish did not influence whether the fish developed the intersex condition. However, a higher proportion of roach in the exposed group with parents from the Grantham Canal developed ovarian-like cavities when compared to roach from the two Thames rivers (Mole and Gade), which had similar phenotypes. Interestingly the Grantham population substantially differed from the Thames populations in allele frequencies of several oestrogen-responsive genes: AR, FSH receptor, VTG3 and Cyp1A1. EE2 exposure also increased the proportion of females at sexual maturity after two years. This is a novel finding for roach, and a first for species that breed once a year, and could lead to population-level impacts. This was unrelated to the river origin of the parent fish.

Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) frequencies in wild populations identified several genes with signatures of selection in one or more of the pairwise comparisons between populations from effluent-polluted and clean rivers. Among genes under selection were several oestrogen-responsive candidate genes: the androgen receptor (AR), FSH receptor, cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), hydroxysteroid (11-beta) dehydrogenase 2 (11?-HSD), aquaporin 12 (AQP12), oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), and vitellogenin 3 (VTG3). However, none of these genes was consistently identified as being under selection in all comparisons between high and low/no effluent populations, and some were also under selection in comparisons of populations at clean rivers. This suggests that factors other than exposure to oestrogenic effluents may be, at least in part, responsible for the pattern. 

Strikingly our analysis found the androgen receptor (AR) to be under strong selection in a large number of pairwise comparisons. Notably, this gene was identified as an 'outlier' in all comparisons involving the Lee population, suggesting strong selection at this site. Our collaborative work with CEH has identified that this population has historically been exposed to a range of pesticides and detectable concentrations of the DDT metabolite, p,p '-DDE, an antiandrogen, are still found in the body tissues of roach at this site. SNPs in the AR gene with signatures of selection did not alter the amino acid sequence, so the true SNP under selection may lie in a regulatory region. The xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) also showed a strong signature of selection in a number of comparisons, particularly those involving populations from the Lee and the Cuffley with populations from elsewhere in the Thames catchment, and between populations in the Thames and Humber Catchments. This gene plays a key role in the metabolism of a wide range of compounds including polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and is under selection in populations of other fish species exposed to PAHs. Another identified as under selection in some comparisons was ALPK2 which is crucial for luminal apoptosis and DNA repair-related gene expression. Overall our results to date indicate that chemical exposure, but not necessarily oestrogens derived from WwTW effluents is an important selective pressure on wild roach populations.

Our analysis identified randomly-selected 'control' genes as having strong signatures of selection in comparisons between populations in the Thames catchment and those in the Humber in northern England. Three of these are involved production of red blood cells: erythroid differentiation related gene (EDRF1) and ADNP homeobox (ADNP2a) that are involved in the expression of globin genes and PIG-T that is involved in essential for attachment of GPI to proteins on the surface of red blood cells. Water oxygen concentration, which is influenced by both temperature and pollution, may therefore have acted as an important selective pressure on roach.

Genome wide SNP genotyping using RAD-seq of roach from the historically polluted River Lee and the low effluent Cuffley Brook provided 11,736 polymorphic RAD loci revealed a large number of genes with a signature of selection. Among the genes providing a strong signature of selection were several that are related to regulation of cell growth and DNA repair. Functional annotation in DAVID identified two overrepresented categories amongst these genes; metal ion binding and exposure to organic substances, which are both consistent with the hypothesis that exposure of roach to chemical pollution has acted as a selective pressure. These analyses are ongoing.

Finally, analyses of the DNA microsatellite dataset demonstrated, for the first time, that populations of roach in rivers in the Humber Catchment are genetically distinct from those from the Thames and other southern rivers. These data also clearly demonstrated that weirs in some of the rivers are effective at restricting movements of roach confining populations to river stretches over multiple generations, consistent with the findings from our previous project. Our microsatellite genotyping also identified a large proportion of the 'roach' from the Hull were, in fact, Ide, an invasive species.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Establishing whether fish (here roach) have adapted to oestrogenic contaminants, how they do this (the mechanisms) and the possible fitness costs of these adaptations are essential in understanding resilience (and thus sustainability) of fish populations living in these polluted environments.

This includes 87 SNPs within 36 key genes involved in responses to endocrine disruption such as hormone receptors (oestrogen/androgen receptors), vitellogenins and aromatases. It also includes 121 SNPs in different protein coding genes, randomly selected from the transcriptome. In addition, a further 6,000 SNPs have been identified in 593 genes but were not genotyped in the project. Of these, ~4000 of these will provide high quality SNPs providing a valuable resource for rapid genotyping of large numbers of roach into other aspects of adaptation, population genetic structure and for practical management of the species (e.g. restocking). Some of these SNPs may be of use in related species such as rudd, ide and bream, but this need to be tested.</gtr:description><gtr:id>08798E1A-3A0B-4191-985D-1DE7D4581F9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>as above</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A SNP panel for roach</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>We have also used RAD-seq to develop a sex probe for roach in collaboration with NBAF - Edinburgh.
