regulation of protein turnover and carbohydrate metabolism in human skeletal muscle</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/G011435/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Obesity in humans has been shown to result in the increased release of small inflammatory-inducing proteins, called cytokines, from the fat cells of the body. We are interested in the effects of these cytokines on the mechanisms that control muscle mass and metabolism in the obese human. Previous research from work in cells and animals has shown the cytokines reduce the synthesis of muscle proteins and simultaneously enhance their rate of breakdown, resulting in a loss of muscle mass. Furthermore, research suggests that the same cytokines may inhibit carbohydrate oxidation, a pivotal step in muscle metabolism. However, despite these potential negative consequences for skeletal muscle function, the effect of low-level and persistent inflammation as seen in obese humans, remains largely unknown. Our animal based work demonstrated, for the first time, that the molecular events that occur in muscle to reduce muscle mass and inhibit carbohydrate oxidation operate, at least following statin-induced myopathy and sepsis, in unison. Moreover, these events appear to be dependent on the inactivation of a single enzyme, called AKT. Interestingly, the molecular events that result in increased activity of AKT also appear inhibited by the cytokines. Given the findings from cell and animal research, we believe that in obese individuals, where levels of cytokines in the blood are elevated, synthesis of muscle proteins and carbohydrate oxidation may be reduced and breakdown of muscle proteins increased, and that these observations are due to cytokine inactivation of the AKT enzyme. In the current application, we therefore wish to measure the rates of synthesis and breakdown of muscle proteins in conjunction with rates of carbohydrate oxidation in obese individuals, and compare them to rates determined in healthy non-obese individuals. We intend to make these measurements by utilising stable isotope techniques and determining O2 uptake and CO2 production by the subject. Furthermore, we intend to obtain tissue samples from the thigh muscles of volunteers, allowing us to examine the molecular signalling events that underpin these processes and thus determine for the first time the effect of obesity associated low-dose chronic inflammation on essential muscle events. Following these initial determinations, we will start the subjects on a 12-week course of either pioglitazone, an insulin-sensitiser often prescribed to type II diabetics, or a placebo. Pioglitazone and similar compounds have been shown to increase the activity of AKT in obese and diabetic patients and normalise the levels of cytokines in the blood of the former. By repeating the initial measurements described above, and by accurately determining the levels of the cytokines, we hope to elucidate their role in the instigation of any molecular or functional effect in the obese individual. Furthermore, we wish to determine if an insulin sensitising agent can reverse purported effects of obesity on molecular events in muscle and moreover, lead to functional improvements in synthesis and breakdown of muscle proteins and muscle carbohydrate metabolism. The proposed experiments will be performed in the Centre for Integrated Systems Biology and Medicine (CISBM; www.nottingham.ac.uk/cisbm) at the University of Nottingham Medical School, where integrated human physiology is a major research focus. This work is essential because it will further our understanding of the health consequences of obesity which is all the more important given the purported obesity epidemic threatening to face the Western World in future years. Furthermore, this work may have implications for other disease states characterised by low-grade chronic inflammation. This work therefore falls within the strategic plan of the Diet and Health theme of the BBSRC Agri-Foods Committee.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Obesity is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation and elevated circulating levels of the cytokines TNFa and IL-6. In vitro and animal based evidence has shown TNFa and IL6 to negatively impact upon protein synthesis, protein degradation and fuel metabolism in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, despite the increasing incidence of obesity and the potential negative connotations on muscle function, the effect of obesity-induced elevations of the cytokines on muscle protein turnover and carbohydrate oxidation in humans is largely unknown. Utilising contemporary isotope and respiratory gas exchange methodologies during insulin clamp conditions in obese and non-obese individuals, we will determine the consequences of obesity on muscle protein turnover and carbohydrate metabolism. The taking of muscle samples will enable us to examine by RT-PCR and Western blot the transcriptional and translational changes to the signalling pathways thought to underpin these processes, namely the AKT/mTOR pathway (protein synthesis), the ubiquitin proteasome system, including the MAFbx and MuRF1 ubiquitin ligases (protein degradation), and PDC activity and PDK expression (carbohydrate metabolism). Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that these three processes may be intrinsically linked via the activity of AKT, whose own activity is known to be negatively impacted by the action of the cytokines. To investigate this further, we will administer to the subjects a course of pioglitazone, a compound known to normalise cytokine levels and increase muscle AKT activity in the obese, and follow up by repeating our initial functional and molecular measurements, thereby allowing us to determine whether any effect of pioglitazone on protein turnover and carbohydrate metabolism occurs in a fashion that is consistent with the proposed central role of AKT in the regulation of these processes, and whether this leads to functional improvements in muscle protein turnover and carbohydrate oxidation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-05-24</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-05-25</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>591245</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Glenfield Hospital</gtr:department><gtr:description>Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry/MRC Consortium</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF860CE5-AD8B-436E-B7E7-E9CA816FCC3B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A new EME outline grant application has been submitted between members of the consortium.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Funding has been provided by the Association and Novartis to undertake a gene array study in COPD vs control volunteers aimed at understanding the molecular basis of the restoration of muscle mass and function in COPD.

Non-communicable chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and type 2 Diabetes account worldwide for ~48% of healthy life years lost (Disability Adjusted Life Years DALYs; ~65% of all current deaths, and are projected to cause over 75% of all deaths by 2030. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental evidence has established a causal relationship between NCDs and preventable risk factors, with physical inactivity being at the heart of these. Moreover, there is accumulating epidemiological evidence to suggest that sitting time is an independent risk factor, perhaps being even independent of the amount of leisure-time physical activity and body adiposity. The study of sedentariness is an emergent science, meaning we know relatively little about the physiological drivers and mechanisms mediating the metabolic and dysregulation associated with sedentariness or the time-course of their effects with few mechanistic studies to date reliant upon measures that are definitive in terms of muscle protein turnover and insulin resistance. This disconnect will ultimately limit the effectiveness of strategies to combat this burgeoning public health problem. 
The purpose of this symposium was to present current information on the metabolic physiology of sedentariness. The senior speakers will provided an overview of current insights gained from human mechanistic studies of acute immobilisation/ inactivity as well as applied studies of the acute effects of sitting time and their influence on cardio-metabolic risk, whilst early career researchers presented their current cutting-edge research utilising both basic and applied science approaches.

New data demonstrate obesity in older adults is associated with systemic (but not muscle) inflammation compared to healthy weight control volunteers, but this has no impact upon rates of post-absorptive muscle protein synthesis. However, obesity in older people is associated with diminished muscle metabolic quality, evidenced by the blunting of muscle protein synthesis and leg glucose uptake in the post-prandial state. Nonetheless this is not associated with lower leg lean mass or strength, perhaps in part due to a simultaneous decline in LPB in response to nutrients or the increased muscle work performed by obese individuals when moving.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4A3B3FEE-27D8-4A51-83FE-A41BBD37FA9C</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>To examine the effects of obesity in old age on muscle protein turnover, carbohydrate (CHO) metabolism, and the underlying mechanisms responsible, we performed a detailed set of metabolic experiments on lean and obese men aged 55-75; conducted in accordance with the protocol detailed in the grant proposal. From this work, we made the following observations: 



Under experimentally induced fasting conditions, muscle protein synthesis and leg breakdown rates were equivalent between lean healthy subjects and obese individuals, the latter in a confirmed low-grade inflammatory state. In contrast, the anticipated enhancement of fractional protein synthetic rate (FSR) to elevated serum amino acid and insulin concentrations was blunted in obese participants (37% increase (NS) vs. 108% in the lean (P&amp;lt;0.05)), with a negative linear correlation between leg fat mass and change in FSR with feeding (r2= 0.18; P&amp;lt;0.05). These differences could not be explained by a discord in hypertrophy signalling, with similar enhancements of AKT and mTOR phosphorylation between groups in response to amino acid and insulin provision. 



In spite of anabolic resistance in the obese, net leg protein balance, leg lean mass and quadriceps isometric strength were equivalent between groups, due in large part to a reciprocal fall in leg proteolysis in obese, but not lean subjects (decreased by 54%; P&amp;lt;0.05). This occurred in parallel to a fall in proteasome-mediated protein breakdown in obese subjects, where a 24% decrease (P&amp;lt;0.05) in chymotrypsin-like activity was observed, but this was not the result of changes in nuclear Foxo1/3 phosphorylation or MAFbx and MuRF1 protein levels which remained constant throughout the study. 



In muscle biopsy specimens obtained at baseline, we observed a significant (FDR&amp;lt;0.1) downregulation of mRNA transcripts associated with oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial content in obese subjects. In keeping with the perceived reduction in muscle oxidative capacity in the obese, a hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp failed to elevate the respiratory exchange ratio unlike the lean subjects where a significant elevation was observed (0.72+0.02 to 0.82+0.03; P&amp;lt;0.05). Similarly, leg glucose uptake was significantly greater in the lean compared to obese subjects (lean 156.0+15.3 AUC under steady state conditions vs. obese 56.6+7.5; P&amp;lt;0.001), suggesting CHO oxidation was impaired. 



As hypothesised, PPAR gamma agonist administration normalised obesity-induced elevations in circulating IL-6, TNFalpha and resistin to lean levels. The treatment also promoted a 1.3-fold enhancement in the response of mTOR phosphorylation to feeding in obese subjects (P&amp;lt;0.05), but this was not mirrored by changes in other measured signalling processes. Importantly, a trend persisted between leg fat mass and change in FSR with feeding following PPAR gamma agonist administration (p=0.095; r2=0.35) and the drug had no effect on leg lean mass, suggesting that the anabolic resistance to feeding in obese elderly individuals was not the result of chronic low-grade inflammation. Likewise, the treatment was ineffective at restoring whole-body CHO oxidation following feeding, although a partial restoration of leg glucose uptake to lean values was observed (53.4+11.7 pre-treatment AUC vs. 84.0+12.9 post-treatment; P&amp;lt;0.05). 



To conclude, obesity in old age is characterised by the development of anabolic resistance to feeding, but net protein balance and muscle mass is preserved as a result of a reciprocal fall in muscle proteolysis. These changes cannot be rationalised by changes in hypertrophic signalling processes and provides an example where AKT signalling does not reflect the overlaying processes it is thought to regulate. Crucially, we show (i) obesity-induced inflammation plays a minor role in these processes or in the dysregulation of CHO metabolism, and (ii) the phenomenon of sarcopenic obesity does not appear to exist, i.e. muscle mass was not reduced in obese older volunteers compared to non-obese older volunteers. These findings therefore make significant contributions to the science of ageing and research translation</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have shown obesity-induced inflammation plays only a minor role in the dysregulation of muscle protein balance and carbohydrate metabolism in older people. Furthermore, the phenomenon of sarcopenic obesity does not appear to exist, i.e. muscle mass was not reduced in obese older volunteers compared to non-obese older volunteers. Our findings therefore make significant contributions to our understanding human ageing. Importantly, obesity will not accelerate the loss of muscle mass and development of frailty with ageing. This is a clear public health message. A formal collaboration was instigated between Abbott Nutrition and the University of Nottingham on a project aimed at minimising muscle weakness and frailty in the elderly via long-term nutritional intervention. 



Partly as a consequence of this BBSRC funded project, a non-disclosure agreement has been signed and formal discussions have begun concerning research collaboration between the PI's laboratory and GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, USA focussed on muscle inflammation and adaptation.



A research grant was submitted to Arthritis Research UK aimed at using protocols/strategies developed in this project to blunt muscle inflammation in older people with arthritis.
