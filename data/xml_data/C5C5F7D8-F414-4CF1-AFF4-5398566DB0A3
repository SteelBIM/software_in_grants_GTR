Enhancing the Legitimacy of Delegated Agencies</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L010925/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research project will examine how to improve the legitimacy of delegated agencies. Examples of delegated agencies range from Non-ministerial Departments like the Forestry Commission, to Non-departmental Public Bodies such as the Environment Agency, and European agencies like the European Banking Authority. These agencies or 'quangos' offer a range of practical benefits such as meeting long-term policy commitments, instituting expertise in policymaking, and helping to reduce overload on central government. At the same time, however, they often suffer from problems relating to their democratic legitimacy, as they cannot claim the same electoral mandate as politicians. This research project will examine ways in which the legitimacy of agencies can be improved, or made more robust, and hence how the benefits they have for governance can be maximised. In particular, the research looks at how legitimacy can be enhanced via external engagement with stakeholders, the media, and the wider public, focusing on six delegated agencies at the UK and EU levels in three policy areas (health technology regulation, disease control and prevention, and food safety). Through a mixture of surveys of stakeholders, semi-structured interviews, and analysis of media coverage and agency documents, the research will examine what strategies agencies have for engaging with the public, and whether those strategies help improve trust and confidence in the agencies. The project will then produce recommendations for how agencies may adopt improved strategies for engagement to enhance public trust and confidence and increase their levels of legitimacy. Workshops with agencies and policy documents will be produced to help agencies implement the recommendations from the project. Moreover, the PI will engage more widely with the public by holding a public event, writing online blog posts, and producing a factual documentary on the issue of legitimacy in contemporary governance, translating the specific academic themes of the project into broader topics of discussion for enhancing public knowledge and understanding of complex forms of delegated governance.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In order to achieve impact the project will pursue strategies in both the policy and wider public realms, as follows (see pathways to impact):

Firstly, in order to enhance impact and facilitate the aims of institutional learning across policy spheres and levels of governance, three workshops will be held in Sheffield bringing all agencies involved in the study together to: discuss initial research design; receive feedback and suggestions on survey questions, provide results of an initial analysis and discuss issues raised and collect comments on findings, and discuss the policy document produced by the PI. These workshops will provide an initial base for achieving impact, and can then be 'rolled out' to address stakeholder engagement in other delegated agencies at the national and European levels. In order to facilitate this 'rolling out' of findings to other agencies, the PI will draw on contacts within the UK Cabinet Office, in particular Ross Neilson, at the Efficiency and Reform Group, who has expressed interest in developing measures of stakeholder engagement for the Cabinet Office's independent 'What works' Institutes. In particular, the PI will produce a document detailing the methodology used to measure external legitimacy, which will provide a framework for delegated agencies to track their own levels of trust and confidence from stakeholders and can be distributed via the Cabinet Office. To enable dissemination at the EU level and internationally, the PI will draw on an international network (see Case for Support), for example, presenting findings at the Notre Europe think tank (headed by Renaud Dehousse) and the Utrecht School of Governance (where Mark Bovens is Chair of Public Administration), which has close links to European civil servants.

In terms of wider public relevance of this project relating to the broader issue of legitimacy, the PI will use general insights from the study to generate an impact in three distinctive and innovative ways. Firstly, the PI will develop an innovative and original proposal for a documentary to be screened at the Sheffield International Documentary Festival (Doc/fest). Doc/fest is an internationally renowned showcase for documentary films and will create vast opportunities for impact and engagement previously unavailable to an academic project of this kind. The specific documentary proposal will be entitled 'Who Runs Europe?' and will seek to inform the audience in an easy and accessible manner about the roles, responsibilities and competencies of delegated agencies, as well as raising broader debates about the nature of accountability, responsibility and legitimacy in a multi-level political system. In order to develop the skills necessary to make the documentary, the PI will hire a documentary mentor, provided by Doc/fest, to run four two hour one-to-one sessions over three months. The PI will report on his experience of documentary making via the Political Studies Association's blog and newsletter, and suggest how other political scientists may use documentaries as an impact tool. Secondly, the PI will seek to write a column in the Guardian Public Leaders Network on stakeholder engagement and legitimacy. Thirdly, the PI will hold an event open to the public entitled 'A New Politics', to discuss new ways of improving the local and national political system and improving accountability and legitimacy. The one day event will be based at Firth Court and will invite members from up to 30 local community groups (such as youth organisations, religious bodies, and campaign groups) to a discussion with local politicians and academics from the University. This event will be run in conjunction with, and partially funded by, the PSA special group on Anti-politics and Depoliticisation, co-founded by the PI. In order to achieve these aims the PI will have the substantial backing of the newly established Crick Centre at Sheffield Politics Department.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>128450</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>The Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Legitimation Crisis of Delegated Agencies</gtr:description><gtr:id>F8078E92-02A4-457B-BFE7-E7A6E683F9E0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ECPR Workshop co-authored paper</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Prof Landwehr has co-written the research paper and employed a research assistant to help conduct empirical data collection.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I have done research with Prof Claudia Landwehr at the University of Mainz on the legitimation crisis of delegated agencies.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>New Economics Foundation</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The Pursuit of Devolution</gtr:description><gtr:id>F50168DF-12B0-4290-8028-8A6476589093</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A report was produced on the research and an event was held in London in December 2015 launching and debating the report.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Sarah Lyall, researcher at the New Economics Foundation, co-wrote the report on the devolution deals, and had time bought out of her contract to do so by the University of Sheffield.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>I co-wrote a report on the democratic legitimacy of the UK Conservative Government's devolution deals.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Blog - the UK and EU need major democratic reform</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>661F25D7-F4B2-4BAD-A813-434042644999</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Blog for The Conversation after the EU referendum suggesting democratic reform of both EU and UK delegated agencies, through stakeholder engagement.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://theconversation.com/uk-and-eu-both-need-major-democratic-reform-to-survive-brexit-fallout-55870</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>YouTube video 'How Democratic is the EU?'</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>815281CD-A005-48DD-B6A8-9AC0150078EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I curated and chaired a public-facing panel of academics, volunteers and business leaders focused on informing the public about EU institutions in advance of the EU referendum on 20th May 2016, collaborating with the UK and EU project led by Prof Michael Keating.

Firstly, the research project has involved analysis of a survey conducted by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to examine the quality of its engagement with stakeholders. The EMA gave Matthew Wood exclusive access to the survey data after her advised them on questions to include in the survey, and he produced a series of presentations at EMA offices in London in which he analysed the data and produced recommendations. These included targeting communication at broader stakeholder groups including the general public, media and academics, and making the EMA website more accessible. This would improve the transmission of important information on new medicines, and more generally to improve public awareness and understanding of the Agency. These findings have been adopted by the Agency and will be incorporated in a new five year communications strategy. Moreover, the EMA has commissioned a second stakeholder survey utilising the original survey questions designed in this research project. Matthew Wood will again collaborate with EMA in analysing the results.

The survey questions have also been developed into the first systematic survey of organisational reputation in the public sector. Hurdles to impact in disseminating the EMA survey have been agencies' increasing concern for 'survey fatigue' given a recent proliferation of stakeholder surveys and tightened budget situations, meaning agencies are less likely to support 'external' surveys. Adapting to this context, the project has evolved to develop the survey as a specific focus on the reputation of agencies, including rigorous scientific validity and the added value of creating a specific 'reputation scale' agencies can use in future. This has involved developing the survey questions to create a new, scientifically rigorous survey instrument for measuring reputation, which provides added value to standard agency stakeholder surveys. Collaborating with colleagues in Utrecht and Exeter, the project has developed this new instrument using rigorous techniques in survey methodology. At the time of writing, the European Chemicals Agency have expressed interest in collaborating using this instrument, to be confirmed in early April 2017.

Secondly, at the national (UK) level the theoretical approach of the project on democratic legitimacy has influenced practitioner and policy debate on the Conservative government's devolution deals. Working with the New Economics Foundation, Matthew Wood produced analysis of the discourse over English devolution under the Coalition government, showing how the issue of democracy had been excluded from debate and suggesting it could be included through introducing citizens assemblies. This resulted in a co-authored report, which informed a submission of evidence to a Parliamentary Select Committee inquiry on the future of UK devolution. The Select Committee published the submission of evidence alongside its final report, 'Devolution: the next five years and beyond', which mirrored the recommendations of the research to 'inject more openness, transparency and public engagement into the deal-making process' (p.47). Secondly, Matthew Wood presented the research findings to a workshop of the West Midlands Combined Authority, which stimulated discussion amongst participants and led to a member of Birmingham Council reporting that the Council would be interested in holding a citizens assembly in the future.

In making these impacts on practitioners and policy makers, this research project, even in its initial few months, has already contributed to enhancing the effectiveness of public services and policy, making them more open and engaged with the public (at the European level) and promoting their democratisation.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C3C93158-144C-4C6F-B206-6BB04B6F56DA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The theory developed in the research so far has been about how the EU can become a legitimate set of institutions. The key finding from the theoretical analysis has been that legitimacy is something developed at an everyday level rather than being an abstract standard we should judge the EU against. In order to evaluate the legitimacy EU in general, and more specifically EU agencies, a sociological approach can show how EU legitimacy is differentiated and uneven across different policy areas. It is very different, for example, in the area of medicine and food regulation to, for example, migration and health and safety. It is seen as far more legitimate in some areas than others.

Empirically analysing all 33 EU agencies, the project has developed a clear map of how those agencies strive to achieve legitimacy through external engagement with stakeholders. Through analysing documents and interviewing a range of officials, the project found agencies tend to adopt four approaches, termed: technical-functional, credibility-seeking, network-seeking and entrepreneurial. This means that agencies sometimes engage more with stakeholders to manage how politically salient they are, or try to become more well-known. Alternatively, they may engage less to maintain their image of independence in a politically volatile environment, or keep to a relatively discrete technical task with low salience. Knowing this means that by analysing how stakeholders view specific agencies, we can assess which approach is best for securing public trust and confidence, and therefore legitimacy.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The empirical map of how EU agencies have sought to gain legitimacy can be utilised by others to examine how different approaches can achieve legitimacy, or whether transitioning from one arrangement to another can be useful for enhancing legitimacy.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>96C6B489-AFF8-4388-BC51-B3674EF32D32</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.crickcentre.org/projects/eu-legitimacy-and-stakeholder-engagement/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Publication of evidence by Parliament Select Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7141662C-8D34-4880-A59C-67F1362F4CC1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A submission to Parliament based on analysis of the democratic legitimacy of the UK Conservative government's devolution deals in England was published by the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government's report, 'Devolution: The Next Five Years and Beyond'.

Subsequent to this, the management board accepted the findings and EMA has published them in its 2015 Annual Report and adopted the recommendations of Matthew Wood's analysis (p.27).

This is the first database to systematically organise and code all of the meetings provided online by the Coalition government.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7BC975FD-E26C-4AD6-8284-3E9F8EAF0443</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The database forms the basis for an article just accepted for publication (7/3/2017) in the British Journal of Politics and International Relations.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Stakeholder engagement and the UK Coalition Government 2010-15</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The first comprehensive database of the formal requirements for stakeholder engagement and the most recent practical strategies of stakeholder engagement (2014) employed by EU Decentralised Agencies.
