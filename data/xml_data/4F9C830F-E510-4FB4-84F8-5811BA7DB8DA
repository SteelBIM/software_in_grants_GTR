deepen our understanding of relationships between nature, health and wellbeing</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K002872/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Existing evidence indicates that natural environments may be a significant positive resource for health and wellbeing. For example they provide opportunities for physical activity and for rest and relaxation. However, the evidence for this is mixed and not entirely clear. This might be partly due to the fact that much of the research has considered natural areas generically as ?greenspace?, where all environments, from urban parks to wild moorland to forests, are considered equal. Contemporary environmental and health policy also reflect this generalisation of natural environments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will address these important knowledge and policy gaps by using the power of existing (secondary) UK data resources. It will geographically link data from large scale surveys (including 2011 Census, Understanding Society and 1958 birth cohort) with national and local ecological datasets.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will also investigate how these relationships differ by rural/urban context and socio-economic status. The research team will work with key policy and practice partners, and will implement a series of activities to ensure that the research is effective and beneficial. It is anticipated that deepening our understanding of nature-health relationships will lead to evidence-based policy and practice development, and consequent health and environmental improvement and protection.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research involving three key project partners has the potential to result in tangible advances in methodology and knowledge which will be of immediate relevance for health and environmental management, policy and practice. Specifically we expect the following sector-oriented impacts:

Health and Social Care Sector: There is increasing interest in: 1) the environmental determinants of health; and 2) how natural environments can be used to support good health. This research will contribute further understanding in relation to both these points. The evidential outcomes will assist organisations including
a) NHS organisations
b) Public Health England and public health departments in their new local authority setting
c) the new Health and Wellbeing Boards
d) innovative social enterprises using natural environments therapeutically (e.g. Dementia Adventure)

We will work with existing practice/policy partners from the health sector to ensure effective dissemination of findings. 

Environmental Management &amp;amp; Policy: The research will benefit those involved in the management of the natural environment though the development of novel methodologies and new, more comprehensive evidence on benefits of environments. Beneficiaries will include:
a) Natural England (project partner)
b) Forest Research (project partner) and consequently Forestry Commission
c) Cornwall Wildlife Trust (project partner) and consequently other Wildlife Trusts
d) Defra, Environment Agency, Countryside Council for Wales
d) Local Nature Partnerships (project researchers are involved in the new Cornwall LNP)
e) Managers of protected/designated areas such as National Park Authorities and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty
f) Landscape designers/architects

The evidence will allow these and other bodies that manage natural environments to develop and improve appropriate national and local responses to policies set out in the 2010 DEFRA white paper 'The Natural Choice' and guidance such as Natural England's Accessible Natural Greenspace Standard. The research will also directly benefit environmental and health/social charities through the provision of clear evidence facilitating the most effective allocation of resources and development of interventions and programmes resulting in maximised benefit to the environment, society and individual. Further beneficiaries include local community groups seeking to protect, manage and use their natural environment under the new Localism Act.

Environmental/health data management and use: A primary aim of this research is to develop methodologies for geographical linkage of data from mixed sources. Advances in this field would be of interest to a wide range of data creators and users; academic, public, private and third sector. Currently much relevant evidence is silo-ed according to disciplinary origin, created using different methodologies, is at varying scales and can be unavailable to many research end-users. This project will attempt to overcome many of these issues; primarily by bringing methods and evidence to a wide range of users and highlighting the value of secondary data.
 
Non-academic research organisations: The project will facilitate the development of cooperative research between academic and public organisations including Natural England and Forest Research, enabling mutual skill development, for instance through a researcher exchange, the building of research capacity and sharing of methods and data. 

Pathways to Impact describes our comprehensive impact strategy, which includes: academic papers in high impact journals and presentations at international conferences; policy-relevant evidence briefing sheets based on key findings; stakeholder engagement conferences; media communications; web dissemination.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>157673</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural England</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>BG Advisory board non-academic collaborators</gtr:description><gtr:id>925619DA-0D55-424F-976D-CFA9F2971154</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Joint publication with Natural England using their MENE data - White et al, Preventive Medicine 2014.

This has arisen through a fairly 'organic' process, through a number of routes.
Firstly, the involvement of non-academic partners (particularly Natural England, Forest Research and Cornwall Wildlife Trust) in the project advisory board meant that we had the opportunity to discuss the research in-depth with individuals from these organisations, and to involve them in its progress. This has led to, for example, us being invited to talk with Cornwall's Conservation Strategy Committee about how to include human health as an aspect of the strategy for nature conservation in the county. On a national scale, our engagement with Natural England and Defra has led to a Defra Fellowship for one of the project team members, who has gone on to form new relationships with health and environmental policy makers at national government level, with the intent that our research will feed into how health is considered in natural environment policy. We have also recently co-produced a large funding proposal for research that will build on Beyond Greenspace, in collaboration with Natural England, Natural Resources Wales and Forest Research, and organisations including National Trust and other NGOs. This process has increased our engagement with these agencies and will ensure that our existing research is considered in their future policy developments.
Second, publicity generated from our research publications has been widespread, especially with the release of longitudinal research using the British Household Panel Survey. The short film produced through the project has received a large number of views, and gives us a useful, generic vehicle to support discussion of this and related research with various audiences.
Third, we have established an excellent online presence, capitalising on social media routes including Twitter (#beyondgreenspace) and the project blog. We have now updated the blog so that it will be used into the future by ourselves and guest bloggers to present and debate our research and related activity in an accessible manner. The blog has received nearly 9000 page views to date (March 2017), and receives spikes in activity whenever we post new stories. More widely, PI Ben Wheeler has participated in a Guardian online debate as 'guest expert'.
Finally, the project has led to specific impact opportunities, notably two ESRC IAA awards to work directly with Cornwall Council; this project was instigated by the Council environment department themselves as a direct result of their interest in the Beyond Greenspace project. We are working with the Council and other relevant stakeholders to consider how the health evidence can feed into local policy and practice, such as how urban parks are maintained to support both biodiversity and human health. Another notable opportunity is our work with WHO to inform development of suggested urban greenspace indicators for the European Region, based on research findings from this and other projects (report published Nov 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>67BD4A45-820B-434E-BA18-829079EB5F66</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Objectives
In this project, we achieved our objectives to develop small-area environmental indices, and to analyse them with secondary health data to investigate the interconnection between nature, health and wellbeing. The environmental indicators include measures such as the percentage of landcover that is broadleaf woodland, arable, urban etc., and measures of biodiversity and landcover diversity. We have combined these environmental data with population and survey data on health and wellbeing in order to address our key research question for the project: &amp;quot;How is residence in proximity to different types of natural environment that vary in type and quality associated with health and wellbeing?&amp;quot;

Research capability
The research team included several early career researchers, and a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds. This project facilitated capability development in two key areas. Firstly, researchers attended specialist training courses, which were put into practice in various aspects of the project, from statistical training to a course on how evidence from research can inform policy. Secondly, regular team meetings provided the opportunity for discussion of research methods and approach, both in terms of practicalities and the underlying concepts driving the research. Working across such a diversity of researchers, with differing ideas and research conventions, presented us with some significant challenges to overcome, but proved to be crucial to address our research questions which cross natural and social science boundaries.

Challenges of longitudinal environment-health secondary data analysis
It is apparent that research investigating relationships between the natural environment and health needs to develop further the use of longitudinal data. This type of data follows the same people over time and gives us more powerful evidence than that based on cross-sectional (snapshot) data. We have successfully used the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS)/Understanding Society longitudinal datasets for this purpose. However, it is clear that a major challenge for this work is the availability of longitudinal, geographical environmental data that have been collected and processed consistently over time to match with longitudinal health data. For example, whilst we have excellent data from the BHPS from 1991-2008, we have only been able to match this with land cover data for 2007. Land cover data sets have changed over time due to changes in environmental science technology and methods, making comparison between years difficult. We are working with data providers and other researchers to develop approaches to address these challenges.

Findings
Two papers describing results of the research are already published in peer-reviewed journals. One describes preliminary analyses relating to the changes in neighbourhood green space when people move home to their mental health. We showed that people moving to a greener urban area report better mental health, which stays improved for at least three years subsequently. The other published paper shows that people living nearer the coast in England are more likely to meet physical activity guidelines than those living further inland. Further findings are under peer review or in preparation and relate to a) relationships in rural contexts, b) local case study analyses and c) additional longitudinal analyses.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In terms of academic routes, we envisage the outcomes of this research being taken forward by ourselves and other researchers investigating the links between nature, health and wellbeing. The small-area environmental indices developed (or variants of them) have the potential to be used with various cohort and survey datasets. The questions generated through, for example, our analyses of 2011 census data, can be approached using more complex individual level data, e.g. investigating specific relationships between health and biodiversity.

The project has generated a lot of interest among non-academic audiences, particularly in the natural environment sector, both governmental and non-governmental. We are working with Defra to carry forward some of the research outcomes looking at the health and wellbeing aspects of the natural environment, and more locally have been invited to participate in the activities of the Cornwall Conservation Strategy Committee. We are also working closely with Natural England and Public Health England to take this research forward in a manner that will be beneficial for both environmental and health user communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>FD997E71-3496-433C-B0F8-E40BA407C172</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://beyondgreenspace.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Defra evidence statement March 2017</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA277C5C-6229-4F68-BB67-12376EE8D651</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://beyondgreenspace.net/2017/03/09/defra-evidence-statement-on-the-links-between-natural-environments-and-human-health/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Input to Urban Green Infrastructure POSTNote</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>674EB01A-5EA7-4E0E-A116-594DB2DB00EF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/briefing-papers/POST-PN-448/urban-green-infrastructure</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>POSTNote Green space and health</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F07D73D4-9219-472D-B395-902EF38BF7CB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PN-0538</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Cornwall Conservation Strategy Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>53E274ED-3D88-439D-B06D-BFD7F21271D3</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guidance committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>ESRC IAA Social Policy Network on Biodiversity, health and wellbeing in Cornwall's public open spaces</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CBB6A0C9-405F-4B68-A626-4CCE5DB01DEB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ecehh.org/news/council-partnership/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The Carstairs Deprivation Index calculated for the Census 2011, for Lower-layer Super Output Areas and DataZones (GB).</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF0ED6A7-4E41-4011-A356-2E31A4E43DBF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Standard socio-economic deprivation index updated to 2011 and made available to the research community via the UK Data Service.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Carstairs Index 2011</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=851497&amp;type=Data%20catalogue</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BCF81B45-0E95-41B1-954E-61F6E55B9540"><gtr:id>BCF81B45-0E95-41B1-954E-61F6E55B9540</gtr:id><gtr:title>What accounts for 'England's green and pleasant land'?
