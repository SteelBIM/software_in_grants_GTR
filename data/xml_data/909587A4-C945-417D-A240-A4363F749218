While the former increase is primarily due to fossil fuel burning, the increase in methane concentrations is more complex, reflecting not only direct human activity but also feedback mechanisms in the climate system related to temperature and hydrology-induced changes in methane emissions. To unravel these complex relationships, scientists are increasingly interrogating ancient climate systems. Similarly, one of the major challenges in palaeoclimate research is understanding the role of methane biogeochemistry in governing the climate of ice-free, high-pCO2 greenhouse worlds, such as during the early Paleogene (around 50Ma). The lack of proxies for methane concentrations is problematic, as methane emissions from wetlands are governed by precipitation and temperature, such that they could act as important positive or negative feedbacks on climate. In fact, the only estimates for past methane levels (pCH4) arise from our climate-biogeochemistry simulations wherein GCMs have driven the Sheffield dynamic vegetation model, from which methane fluxes have been derived. These suggest that Paleogene pCH4 could have been almost 6x modern pre-industrial levels, and such values would have had a radiative forcing effect nearly equivalent to a doubling of pCO2, an impact that could have been particularly dramatic during time intervals when CO2 levels were already much higher than today's. Thus, an improved understanding of Paleogene pCH4 is crucial to understanding both how biogeochemical processes operate on a warmer Earth and understanding the climate of this important interval in Earth history.

We propose to improve, expand and interrogate those model results using improved soil biogeochemistry algorithms, conducting model sensitivity experiments and comparing our results to proxy records for methane cycling in ancient wetlands. The former will provide a better, process-orientated understanding of biogenic trace gas emissions, particularly the emissions of CH4, NOx and N2O. The sensitivity experiments will focus on varying pCO2 levels and manipulation of atmospheric parameters that dictate cloud formation; together, these experiments will constrain the uncertainty in our trace greenhouse gas estimates. To qualitatively test these models, we will quantify lipid biomarkers and determine their carbon isotopic compositions to estimate the size of past methanogenic and methanotrophic populations, and compare them to modern mires and Holocene peat. The final component of our project will be the determination of how these elevated methane (and other trace gas) concentrations served as a positive feedback on global warming.

In combination our work will test the hypothesis that elevated pCO2, continental temperatures and precipitation during the Eocene greenhouse caused increased wetland GHG emissions and atmospheric concentrations with a significant feedback on climate, missing from most modelling studies to date. This work is crucial to our understanding of greenhouse climates but such an integrated approach is not being conducted anywhere else in the world; here, it is being led by international experts in organic geochemistry, climate, vegetation and atmospheric modelling, and palaeobotany and coal petrology. It will represent a major step forward in our understanding of ancient biogeochemical cycles as well as their potential response to future global warming.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal is of wide and direct relevance to the Earth Sciences academic community and associated stakeholders. It explicitly addresses two strategic themes of the new NERC strategy for 2007-2012: Earth System Science and Biodiversity. In particular, our research meets three of the six key outcomes identified in the overarching 'Earth system science' theme, as NERC seeks to provide &amp;quot;knowledge of the impact of potential mitigation and adaptation strategies to forthcoming climate change&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;understand tipping points and rates of change&amp;quot;, and aims to provide &amp;quot;better assessment of the risk of changes in the Earth system to inform policy decisions&amp;quot;. The results of this proposal help the UK meet the strategy challenges to &amp;quot;provide forewarning of abrupt changes in the Earth System&amp;quot;, to &amp;quot;improve knowledge of the interaction between the evolution of life and the Earth&amp;quot;, and to &amp;quot;understand the forces and feedbacks that drive the Earth System&amp;quot;. As such, prompt and high profile delivery of our results to our scientific peers is a key component of our Impact strategy, and we have requested funds for conference attendance by the PI, CoIs and PDRAs. We have a very strong track record in conference attendance (including invited keynote presentations) and rapid, high profile publication of our work; that good practice will be continued as part of the proposed work.

Of course, our conclusions will also be of wide interest to the public, policy makers, climate-orientated NGOs and other NERC stakeholders; we, as a society, will benefit from this research because it furthers our understanding of climate change and informs our predictions for future change. As such, we have an ambitious impact programme built around two main (non-academic) themes:

1. Public engagement. The University of Bristol is a national leader in public engagement: Bristol, along with the University of the West of England, is the coordinator of the national engagement beacons; we had the first Professor of Public Engagement (K Sykes); and our two Centres of Excellence in Chemistry and Anatomy are world leading in terms of the quantity and quality of outreach activity. The PI and our Co-Is have been particularly active in this capacity, including serving on the organising committee for the Bristol Festival of Nature, hosting BBC series, giving &amp;gt;100 talks to fellow scientists and the wider public and writing books marketed to the general public (The Emerald Planet: How Plants Changed Earth's History by DJB). Funds to support our Impact Plan will allow us to exploit the best practices developed elsewhere, allowing us to: embed a methane component in the Bristol ChemLabS lecture series (&amp;gt;100 lectures to ca 30,000 people per year); develop a website, complete with interactive tools; and have a prominent display at the Bristol Festival of Nature hosted by ourselves but also Sixth Form students who will have done summer internships in our labs. 

2. Stakeholder engagement: We have hosted MPs in the past, and Pancost and Singarayer have numerous connections with the Bristol City Council via our involvement in the University of Bristol centenary fund and the Bristol Festival of Nature. Also via the Festival of Nature, we have excellent connections with the Environment Agency and charitable trusts devoted to wetland awareness and conservation. We will use these connections to host events where our research is explained to and discussed with a range of stakeholders. It is our intention to make our political leaders more aware of the sensitivity of wetlands to climate change - and therefore, the need to better understand these environments. Of course, this will also be an ideal mechanism to update policy makers with the most up-to-date research on this particular 'tipping point' in the Earth System, a particularly important goal of the NERC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>320910</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The 2015 Green Capital Arts Programme comprised dozens of events, exhibits and neighbourhood arts projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>03F995F2-EE6B-4A90-98A6-A77C30E630B2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I made numerous contributions, all informed by past climate research funded by the NERC (and others), including:

Despite numerous activities, the year was widely perceived as failing to crack through the long-standing inclusion issues that affect the city of Bristol and other British core cities as well as much of the global 'green' movement. Given these inclusion concerns, Pancost (on behalf of the University of Bristol Cabot Institute) and the Bristol Green Capital Partnership funded Ujima Radio to continue its Green and Black Programme of activity; we jointly convened a variety of workshops with BME leaders in Bristol, documenting their concerns and learning about how subtle issues had a collective negative impact on inclusion. We found little evidence for active exclusion. Nonetheless, many implicit assumptions and behaviours of that 'in-crowd' - from choosing venues that were perceived as 'off-limits' to last-minute planning - effectively disenfranchised some citizens. This implicit exclusion made it difficult to entrain the alternative voices needed to develop an ongoing dialogue about NERC-derived environmental and climate change research that appeals to, connects to and learns from the experiences of Britain's BME communities. To address this, we created the Green and Black Ambassadors Programme. This programme has several goals, supported by the Cabot Institute, BGCP and the NERC (&amp;pound;22K between all three), but the two that arose directly from connecting diverse communities to NERC research are: 1) Initiating a dialogue with BME communities to identify new and vital research directions, inspired by their concerns, needs, experience and knowledge; and 2) exploring the ways in which environmental research resonates with BME communities, revealing opportunities for stronger, more relevant and more inspiring sharing of our findings. Since its launch, the two Ambassadors have engaged hundreds of citizens in Bristol and thousands more through a monthly radio broadcast on Ujima Radio (NOTE: only some of this directly reflected or was inspired by the NERC research, but it was part of the overall portfolio).</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Third sector organisations</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cabot/research/casestudies/2016/green-black-ambassadors.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>School visits</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>774D15CC-B1A4-4277-875D-7686906FAC2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Students visiting the School of Chemistry attended talks on current research, leading to questions and short discussions after the presentations.

It is becoming increasingly clear that a range of feedbacks work on diverse timescales and that lessons derived from long-term investigations of Earth history might not be applicable to rapid climate change similar to what we are experiencing today. The key findings that Eocene terrestrial temperatures were far warmer than those of today, that fire-related processes changed dramatically in the Eocene, and that wetland carbon biogeochemistry was markedly different during greenhouse climates both reinforce our understanding of the Earth system (that elevated pCO2 causes warming) but underscore the complexity of biogeochemical risks associated with that warming. This has underscored Pancost's policy and public engagement, starting with the Bristol Green Capital and continuing with his involvement in Bristol's 50 Year Planning (via the Resilience Sounding Board). Crucially, it creates a framing of contextualised uncertainty - that what we know about climates of the past sharpens our perspectives on future uncertainty. This is directly manifested in Bristol's Resiliency Report which derives from the uncertain impacts of climate change (and other factors) a strategy that emphasises soft and flexible adaptation, including citizen empowerment and community cohesion.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C8E53E73-5602-4BD4-BD68-B97C94E99FDB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has now delivered several key findings on ancient greenhouse climates and associated vegetation and biogeochemical impacts. Additional findings derived from the more challenging biogeochemical modelling aspects are in development. This project has shown that:

Fires became less globally widespread during the Eocene, likely reflecting a change in vegetation and wider global climatic conditions.

European continental temperatures were high and relatively stable during the Eocene and increased during the Early Eocene; crucially, this finding validates marine temperature reconstructions both in terms of absolute temperatures and long-term trends. And it represents the first application of GDGT-based temperature proxies in lignites.

Our work has confirmed the presence of Sphagnum moss in a &amp;gt;50 million year old peat, using a combination of pollen and chemical approaches.

We have made numerous advances in our climate modelling, including improved treatment of daily rainfall functions, an exploration of orbital forcing on methane emissions during greenhouse climates and revised transfer functions from soil models to calculate methane emissions. These advances have not yet been published but have been presented at several international conferences.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In an academic context, this work has shown for the first time the value of lignites as archives of past climate conditions (and reinforces the role of biomarkers in probing ancient biogeochemical processes). The modelling results will likely provide new tools and/or guidance on past reconstruction of terrestrial hydrology and biogeochemistry. 

But perhaps most importantly, from a societal perspective, this work highlights the profound complexity of biogeochemical feedbacks during global warming with important implications for the public (and policy-making) understanding of future climate change impacts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5AEAA582-C394-4CD0-8171-511786FB6554</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0CF78544-2DF8-4BCE-BA47-8C408C6215D6"><gtr:id>0CF78544-2DF8-4BCE-BA47-8C408C6215D6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ecological and biogeochemical change in an early Paleogene peat-forming environment: Linking biomarkers and palynology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f4e2e49319296c9f575fbe09354e1b06"><gtr:id>f4e2e49319296c9f575fbe09354e1b06</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Inglis G</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E099A892-A094-4F9C-A6B2-35A91F3CEB6E"><gtr:id>E099A892-A094-4F9C-A6B2-35A91F3CEB6E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Modelling equable climates of the Late Cretaceous: Can new boundary conditions resolve data-model discrepancies?</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/52dfebadf9d9caab03964c2e22bb8b82"><gtr:id>52dfebadf9d9caab03964c2e22bb8b82</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hunter S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/74694CFF-B457-4E60-8B63-EBF44BF28A86"><gtr:id>74694CFF-B457-4E60-8B63-EBF44BF28A86</gtr:id><gtr:title>Uncertainties in the modelled CO
