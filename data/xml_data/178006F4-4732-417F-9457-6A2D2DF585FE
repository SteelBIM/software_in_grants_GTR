In Great Britain over 95% of flocks have approximately 10% of sheep lame at any one time and 80% of this lameness is caused by footrot. There are approximately 1.6 million lame sheep in GB at any time. Footrot is estimated to cost the UK industry &amp;pound;31 million per year and is a huge worry to sheep farmers who do not feel that advice to manage this disease is successful. Footrot is an infectious disease caused by invasion of the skin between the claws of the foot with a bacterium called Dichelobacter nodosus. Surprisingly little is known about how this bacterium causes disease and how it survives (on the sheep or in the environment) when it is not causing disease. Over the past 7 years we have studied practical aspects of control of footrot. The key results were that farmers who treated lame sheep promptly with injectable antibiotics had low levels of lame sheep in their flocks (4% versus 12%) and also that trimming feet (traditionally used to control footrot) was associated with high levels of disease. These facts suggest that the bacteria may be much more widely spread in the environment than previously suspected from research in Australia. We know that the environment plays a role in disease occurrence. D. nodosus survives better in warm wet weather. We also know that there are several strains of the bacterium that can affect the severity of disease. However, we do not know which aspects of the environment or the bacterial strains are important in determining disease severity and persistence on farms. The bacteria may survive in pasture, in the gut or on the feet of non-diseased sheep. During our work we collected a large store of D. nodosus from swabs of sheep with and without disease and also stored bacterial DNA from the feet of sheep. We also have two years data from approximately 800 ewes and their lambs. Every occurrence of lameness has been recorded and investigated and samples taken to investigate whether D. nodosus as present. From these data we can form mathematical models that describe when a sheep became lame, how long she was lame for and factors that influenced the speed with which she recovered and, unfortunately for some, became lame again. The plan of work we propose is to analyse the data above as described and to add in new findings about D. nodosus from laboratory studies into the ability of strains to cause disease and their survival in the environment. Using results from these studies and our models we will be able to work out which strains of D. nodosus cause most disease and how important the environment and host are in their survival. The ultimate aim is to provide better advice on control of footrot and so lower the occurrence of this disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Footrot, caused by the bacterium Dichelobacter nodosus, is an endemic disease of enormous economic and welfare importance that has undermined the sustainability of the sheep industry for centuries. Little progress has been made in the understanding of disease persistence and a multidisciplinary approach using state-of-the-art molecular techniques and mathematical models is very timely. Farmers identify footrot as their greatest cause of concern in sheep health and recent advances in molecular tools and epidemiological analyses, particularly approaches to strain variation and predictive modelling, make this a feasible project. Current understanding of the relationship between D. nodosus and FR cannot distinguish between 4 hypotheses. These differ in terms of whether D. nodosus survives in the foot or the environment, whether such survival is short or long-term, and hence how transmission occurs. The involvement of other saprophytic, commensal and pathogenic bacteria and the genetic and virulence variation within D. nodosus are other variables to be considered. The over-arching aim is to study the population dynamics and population genetics of D. nodosus with a view to enhancing FR control strategies. We propose a multidisciplinary research programme that uses existing datasets (epidemiological and biological) and exploits recent scientific developments in epidemiology and molecular biology to further our understanding of FR in sheep. Our aim is to use these original data and new molecular biological categorisations and generate mathematical and statistical models to test the hypotheses and eliminate all but one. We will conclude the programme of work by using the remaining hypothesis to design a cohort study in year 4 of the proposal. Healthy and clinically affected sheep will be sampled, collecting data that will be determined from the first three years work. Biological and epidemiological analysis will be used to further our understanding from years 1-3.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>464122</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Green and Kaler have engaged with the public at agricultural shows (Royal Show, Sheep 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010), using

We have created a sea change in understanding of management of footrot in GB. At a recent Sheep Veterinary Society
meeting we presented new evidence that interdigital dermatitis and footrot are the same disease caused by the bacterium
Dichelobacter nodosus; a concept that was not accepted by many in the veterinary community in GB. As a result of this,
the Sheep Veterinary Society is currently drafting new recommendations that will be published nationally on the treatment
and control of footrot in sheep. The recommended treatment of footrot comes from results of two intervention studies
analysed during our project. This treatment has now been tested in India and is as effective in sheep with footrot in India as

Technical Summary
in GB. The current average flock prevalence of lameness is 10%. The results from analysis of our clinical trial highlighted
that it is possible to maintain the prevalence of lame sheep at below 2%: our work was instrumental in the recommendation
from a recent Opinion on Lameness in Sheep published by the Farm Animal Welfare Council that the sheep industry
should aim to reduce the flock prevalence of lameness to 2% in the next 10 years.
Whilst treatment is effective, the incidence rate of footrot is a massive 50/100 sheep per year and microbiological and
epidemiological advances are needed to help us develop alternative control strategies.
Longer term impacts: We have developed global fingerprinting for D. nodosus from isolates from Europe, Australia and
India that indicates that D. nodosus clusters within countries, with similar strains in countries where sheep have been
shared. Further testing of isolates from other parts of the world will help us understand the evolution of this pathogen. We
were the first to publish the microbiome of the sheep foot and report that the bacterial community on an affected foot and
other feet in the same sheep change when sheep become diseased with footrot. In addition quantitative studies of D.
nodosus indicate that it is present on many apparently healthy feet at low numbers and this, together with the difficulty of
isolating D. nodosus from soil or bedding (except within minutes of a sheep having stood on the site), indicate that D.
nodosus is likely to persist primarily on diseased and healthy feet rather than in the environment. We are dealing with a
bacterium that causes little host immunity and results from our mathematical model uses these results to propose that
management of footrot should be thought of as managing the load of D. nodosus in a flock: keeping the load low prevents
long term damage to the foot and this in turn prevents further disease.
During our molecular studies of D. nodosus we have identified a gene that might be linked to the bacteria's ability to invade
the skin. We are currently aiming to identify the structure of the protein from this gene to help understand how invasion
occurs. Future work targeting whole genome sequencing and host local response to infection will further our understanding
of new approaches to prevent disease.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings helped to inform currect best practise for treating footrot in sheep and has been used to inform several
