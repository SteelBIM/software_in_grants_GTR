In some crops, there is 100% infection. The virus has been shown to reduce the seed yield of rape crops in the UK by up to 30% and our experiments on a current revealed a seed yield loss of 45%. TuYV is spread by aphids and growers use insecticidal treatments to try to stop aphid transmission to oilseed rape crops; the insecticides are not always particularly effective in stopping spread of the virus. We have identified an oilseed rape cultivar with quantitative resistance to TuYV (infected plants accumulated significantly less virus than 25 B. napus lines from the Warwick HRI Diversity Fixed Foundation Set ). The seed yield of infected plants was not significantly less than that of uninfected plants in this cultivar. We have also identified complete resistance (no virus infection detectable) to TuYV in some Brassica oleracea lines and Brassica rapa lines. The different resistance sources we have identified will be evaluated against genetically different Turnip yellows virus isolates from the UK. We will take a twin track approach and map the QTLs associated with the quantitative resistance in B. napus and also map the gene(s) controlling the extreme resistance in B. oleracea and B. rapa. Molecular markers for the resistances will be developed that will allow the quantitative resistance to be incorporated in to commercial rape varieties by conventional marker-assisted breeding and the extreme resistance to be incorporated via a resynthesised B. napus route. Once the seed and markers have been handed over to seed companies at the end of the project, we will continue to support them in incorporating the resistance(s) in to their commercial rape varieties. The ultimate aim is to provide farmers with virus resistant oilseed rape varieties in order to increase yields and reduce inputs .</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The new plant genes providing natural resistance to an important virus with allele-specific markers for crop improvement will benefit the breeding companies initially. High levels of TuYV infection of oilseed rape have been seen in recent years. Estimates of yield losses due to TuYV in the UK range from 9-30%. Experiments we have carried out on a current cultivar indicate the losses could be much greater than this (45%) in years of high infection. Consequently, virus-resistant oilseed rape lines will have an advantage in the market place, provided they are otherwise competitive. The use of marker-assisted selection to introgress the virus resistances in to current oilseed rape varieties should minimise linkage drag. The delivery of three different natural sources of resistance to breeders will provide options for combining the genes (pyramiding) or deploying separately and prolonging the useful life of the resistances in the field. The farmers will also be major beneficiaries as they will be able to reduce crop losses in an environmentally and economically sustainable way. Resistance to the major virus in oilseed rape (TuYV) will remove the dependence on and need for insecticidal treatments aimed at controlling the virus (the aphids that transmit the virus are not a major problem in oilseed rape in their own right; growers use the autumn insecticidal treatments primarily in the hope of controlling the virus). This will have environmental as well as economic benefits. The reduction in pesticide usage will also reduce the selection pressure for aphid biotypes with insecticide resistance. The general public will benefit from the research in that it will contribute to food security by providing control measures for a widespread and important crop virus, where currently there appear to be no viable control measures. The academic beneficiaries are listed in the 'Academic Beneficiaries' section.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>486721</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CIRC dissemination</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>95DCA412-9D11-4BD3-BC95-B9F597E45040</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Max Newbert and John Walsh gave presentations on the problems of TuYV infection of oilseed rape to Agronomists in Cambridgeshire, Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Hampshire and to farmers in Oxfordshire. 

Limagrain commissioned a survey of TuYV infection of oilseed rape across Europe with us.

A display on the CIRC project was presented at the University of Warwick Open Day.

There are permanent exhibits on our research describing the effect of TuYV on oilseed rape at Syngenta Innovation Centres. 

Articles on our CIRC project have been published in the popular press and featured on Limagrain's TuYV website: http://www.tuyv.co.uk/

An exhibit describing the research and outcomes of our CIRC-funded project was presented at the Velcourt exhibit at 'Cereals 2015'; we also had exhibits on the Limagrain and AHDB stands.

We have been working with the Rothamsted Research Insect Survey team and utilising the large amount of sequence information of TuYV generated by the CIRC studentship (Max Newbert), a molecular test has been developed to detect TuYV in single aphids caught in Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) Suction Traps. The test allows TuYV to be distinguished from the closely related Beet mild yellowing virus. Incidences of TuYV in the main aphid vector Myzus persicae have been determined in RIS suction traps in Lincolnshire and Warwickshire throughout 2015. Very high incidences of TuYV in M. persicae in both counties have been detected. The data has been made available online on two different websites. There were 3,601 page views of one of these sites up to the end of October this year with a peak of 557 in July.

Exploiting quantitative resistance to TuYV that we have identified in oilseed rape cultivar Yudal, parent of a Brassica napus mapping population. 0 - 30 months 

? An F1 population was produced with Yudal as the female parent that gave consistent results when assayed for TuYV by ELISA. Plants from this F1 population were backcrossed with Darmor (we previously analysed the Yudal backcross) to generate a segregating B1 population.
? This B1 population was assayed for resistance to TuYV by ELISA and genotyped using the Infinium B. napus 60k chip. The chip provides the genotype at over 50,000 SNPs in the B. napus genome, of which ~15,000 are informative in the Darmor/Yudal population.
? This data was used for QTL analysis, in combination with data previously generated, and identified a major QTL with an interval of 8cM (1LOD), accounting for over 50% of the observed variation, as well as two minor QTL which accounted for 9% and 7% of the observed variation.

This fine mapping of the resistance QTL that has been achieved in the project will facilitate the introgression of the quantitative resistance into commercial OSR varieties by the plant breeding industry using marker-assisted selection.

Objective 2. Exploiting complete resistance to TuYV that we have identified in a B. oleracea line from the Warwick DFFS. 0 - 42 months 

? A B1 population has been assayed for resistance and a subset of the population was genotyped utilising the Infinium B. napus 60k chip, having identified 3 potential chromosomes of interest. The entire population (200 individuals) was then genotyped with KASP markers targeted to the three target chromosomes.
? A major QTL was identified with an interval of 12.5cM, which accounted for 35% of the observed variation. 
? Although beyond the scope of the current project, a further round of recombination will further reduce the mapped interval allowing fine mapping of the gene(s) involved. Resistant plants from the B1 population that contained the resistant parent genotype at the intervals of interest have been crossed again to produce B2 populations. These populations will provide a resource for further phenotyping and genotyping, if further funding can be obtained.

Objective 3. Exploiting resistance to TuYV in B. rapa as a further source of resistance alongside the B. oleracea from objective 2, for the resynthesised B. napus introgression route. 0 - 48 months 

? Genotyping of a subset of the B. rapa B1 population has been carried out using the Infinium B. napus 60k chip.
? Mapping indicated one major QTL accounting for 22% of the observed variation and two minor, interacting QTL. Markers spanning a 15 cM interval have been identified for the major QTL.
? This will facilitate the tracking and maintenance of the resistance in backcrossing programmes aimed at introgressing the B. rapa and B. oleracea resistances into commercial B. napus backgrounds.
? Further funding would be required to genotype the remainder of the B1 population in order to narrow down the intervals identified in the project and improve the efficiency of the introgression.

Objective 4a. Determining the virus-resistance specificity of the different resistance sources. 0 - 3 &amp;amp; 18 - 21 months 

? TuYV has previously been categorised into three phylogenetic groups: common, less-common and rare.
? The quantitative resistance in Yudal has been confirmed against isolates from each of these three phylogenetic groups.
? The resistance in B. rapa has also been confirmed against isolates from each of these groups.
? The extreme resistance identified in B. oleracea has been confirmed against isolates from each of these groups.

The confirmation of the effectiveness of each of the three brassica resistance sources against all groups of the virus will ensure that the plant material available to CIRC members has as broad a spectrum of resistance as possible and is potentially durable.

Objective 4b. Produce the resynthesized B. napus. 0 - 18 months. 

? Crossing of our resistant B. rapa with the resistant B. oleracea has been achieved.
? Embryo rescue was used to produce plantlets from the cross; following culture on agar media, the most advanced plants are currently in the glasshouse growing well in compost. 
? Vegetative propagation of these plants via cuttings has begun, this will allow some plants to be challenged with TuYV to measure synergies between the two resistance sources.
? Ploidy testing has been carried out on the more advanced plant material, confirming that the plants are in fact B. rapa / B. oleracea hybrids.

Production of these resynthesised plants will result in the introgression of the extreme resistances identified in B. oleracea and B. rapa into B. napus and provide characterised new sources of resistance with associated molecular markers for the plant breeding industry to introgress in to commercial OSR varieties.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It would be beneficial to identify the genes underlying the QTL for each of the resistance sources in order to develop within-gene markers and better understand the resistance. To date no genes providing resistance against any member of the virus family (Luteoviridae) TuYV is classified in have been identified. The next step in this process will be fine mapping of the QTL utilising the materials from the current CIRC project. Further targeted crosses have been carried out, or are underway, in order to obtain and identify further informative recombination events and thus link genetic markers more closely to the gene(s) of interest.

A BBSRC iCASE studentship with Limagrain has been awarded and started on 1st October, 2015. The project aims to investigate Limagrain's TuYV resistance sources and characterise and develop further new sources of resistance from diploid brassicas.

The CIRC PhD student associated with this project, Max Newbert has been awarded a University of Warwick, Institute of Advanced Studies (IAS) Fellowship to continue some aspects of his research and write up papers from his PhD. He has also been awarded an Impact Fellowship by the University of Warwick. The University recently won some funding, known as the Impact Acceleration Account, from the BBSRC, to help maximise impact from BBSRC research and embed an impact awareness culture within BBSRC funded departments.

Negotiations are under way with two seed companies to commercialise the outputs of the project.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B7271E65-BB01-4147-8DE4-F52452E47C94</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited to and reviewed the Scottish Government's portfolio of strategic research, 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FB84EBF5-DD29-4AFF-A04F-6C6CA6733C63</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6D17107C-8EEF-4EBA-BB9B-82A85A2B8ABD"><gtr:id>6D17107C-8EEF-4EBA-BB9B-82A85A2B8ABD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Encyclopedia of Applied Plant Sciences</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1c9b31e02c2c5e3fd2ab8ca180b93030"><gtr:id>1c9b31e02c2c5e3fd2ab8ca180b93030</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Walsh J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-0-12-394807-6</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0E8A8D45-9EE6-4E52-AE63-777A06BA5919"><gtr:id>0E8A8D45-9EE6-4E52-AE63-777A06BA5919</gtr:id><gtr:title>The genetic diversity of Turnip yellows virus in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) in Europe : pathogenic determinants, new sources of resistance and host range</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/cd2ea000df39364190410a57f1ca22a4"><gtr:id>cd2ea000df39364190410a57f1ca22a4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Newbert Max John</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/I017410/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>D05BC2E0-0345-4A3F-8C3F-775BC42A0819</gtr:id><gtr:text>Unclassified</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
