This is realised through a project that places the technology at the heart of inquiry. Geopolitics is traditionally rooted in understanding the relationships between power, sovereignty, and territory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This research looks at how drone warfare is fundamentally changing these interactions. The unique angle the research investigates is how the drone is itself generative of new and unexpected geographies, both within the UK and beyond. Instead of humans acting as the sole directors of world politics, an array of automated machines and intelligent systems is shifting the terrain of international relations and control. This proliferation of drones, coupled with widespread political and ethical ambivalence over the enmeshing of robots and humans in diverse security scenarios across the planet, is a crucial area that must be met with engaging, timely and relevant research. This project will accordingly use a range of archival and interview data to film and produce a documentary, ?The State of Our Unmanned Planet?, and a related manuscript, ?The Predator Empire?.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>I have an established record of research across a range of fields in geography that have impacted diverse academics through journal articles, book chapters, encyclopaedia entries, seminar talks, and academic conferences. My intellectual aim has always been to conduct research that will benefit academic users who do not normally interact with each other, particularly by connecting social theory with empirically engaged research. For example, during my MA and PhD I was part of a multi-disciplinary team of geographers, entomologists, climatologists, and public health officials in the state of Arizona looking at mosquito control (Shaw et al., 2010). This proposed project is likewise inherently multi-disciplinary and will impact a range of academics outside of the immediate field of political geography and critical geopolitics. This includes researchers working in 'more-than-human' and 'post-human' geographies (Braun and Whatmore, 2010), non-representational geographies (Lorimer, 2008, Thrift, 2008), political ecology (Robbins, 2012), as well as cultural and historical geographies (MacDonald, 2008). While scholars in international relations and security studies will also be impacted, a primary intellectual aim of the project is to forge meaningful connections between academics in critical geopolitics and political geography with academics in continental philosophy, particularly the broadly defined area of 'speculative realism' (Bryant et al. 2011), and those working in object-oriented philosophy (Harman, 2010) and actor-network theory (Latour, 2005; Law, 2002). 

The second major group that will be impacted by the research is the wider public. They will benefit by engaging, discussing, and learning about a critical issue at the forefront of human security and social justice. Drone warfare is a national and international concern. Google's 'Insight for Search' shows that worldwide interest in 'drones' has increased a staggering 300 percent between the years 2004 and 2012. This global appetite for information on drones is not currently met by a sustained academic analysis and engagement. The debate is dominated by journalistic accounts, which usually report the views of state elites and security analysts. And yet, as with the intellectual shortcomings of critical geopolitics, this reporting fails to take into account the production of a new geopolitical reality by unmanned technologies, one beyond the direct control of any particular country, institution, or official. The major impact to the public will therefore by a sustained academic analysis of the causes and consequences of drone warfare through a portfolio of media that presents the key issues and themes in an accessible, educational, and creative format. The 'State of Our Unmanned Planet' documentary will be the primary way of realising this impact, and the online Drone Atlas will be an invaluable tool for collecting, sharing, and disseminating viewpoints and stories from around the world - fundamentally democratising the debate over drone warfare. The companion book will also provide the resources for lasting public engagement and an educational legacy. 

Other key public beneficiaries include the primary groups that I will interview in the project: The U.K Ministry of Defence, The Civil Aviation Authority, The Royal Air Force, journalists from the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Human Rights Groups such as Reprieve, and designers and producers of drone technology. These groups will be interested in the project's primary findings.

The third major group that will be impacted by this research will be the future undergraduate, masters, and PhD students that I mentor, teach, and collaborate with. I will be able to transfer and develop the skills and knowledge obtained during this project directly to them. I am a committed and enthusiastic teacher and continue to value the importance of pedagogy as a form of education, social justice, and practical engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>158143</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This is the long-form documentary of my project, which interviews journalists, academics, and activists from across the U.S. and UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>DCBA23E7-31FB-46EC-9A4E-7E35761DF221</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I will collate the impacts, as the documentary is about to launch.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Documentary: Remote Planet</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2017</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>&amp;quot;Remote&amp;quot; is a short documentary that I made for a documentary course at the Met Film School in 2015.

To that end, I have spoken to undergraduates, post-graduates, academics, members of the public, journalists, and a range of other stakeholders throughout the project's duration (in and beyond the university). I have given these talks across the UK, Europe, and Internationally - most recently at a public talk at the University of Sydney. At every venue audiences have reported how excited they are by the project's findings, and how it has led them to re-think their conceptualizations of drone warfare. My project website has been accessed over 278,000 times, and has been used by activists, artists, and educators across the world. For example, one of my recent paper's was the inspiration behind a series of artworks conducting by Melbourne-based artist Kathyrn Brimblecombe. Finally, I am about to take launch the project's documentary, a vital pathway to impact, which will be hosted online and shown to public venues in the UK. Having only just finished the project, ensuring more diverse forms of non-academic impact is now a priority of mine, particularly with the pending release of the documentary.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0589C971-F8A5-4848-8069-8FA3C3DE26B6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>My research has explored the complex histories, geographies, geopolitics, and philosophical aspects of drone warfare. From the Vietnam War, the war on terror, to the near-future, this 3-year project has documented the rise of drones, how they've changed contemporary geopolitics, and why they are rapidly re-wiring the future of inter-state and non-state violence. This research has been collated and published in a 327-page, peer-reviewed scholarly manuscript, called Predator Empire: Drone Warfare and Full Spectrum Dominance (published by University of Minnesota Press in 2016), as well as in multiple journal articles.

My main finding is that drones have fundamentally shifted the conduct of international conflict: transforming the geographies of organized violence from &amp;quot;labour-intensive&amp;quot; forms of warfare to &amp;quot;robot-intensive&amp;quot; systems. Humans are being pushed further and further &amp;quot;out of the loop&amp;quot; in armed conflict. My research has shown how and why the concept of &amp;quot;empire&amp;quot; is nontheless vital for thinking about the technological and spatial power of an increasingly &amp;quot;unmanned&amp;quot; international geopolitical arena. 

My research reveals how drones disrupt established patterns of warfare, sovereignty, and territory. This complicates mainstream narratives in international relations, which over-emphasise the role of human actors, decisions, and discourses. Accordingly, a core finding of the research is the growing importance of what I call a &amp;quot;more-than-human geopolitics.&amp;quot; Conflict has become hybrid, with artificial intelligence, robots, and algorithms all disrupting the spaces and logics of violence. My research shows why this has profound implications for accountability, governance, and democracy. 

My research has found that the atmosphere is, and will become, a complex space of warfare, commerce, policing, and terror. Drones are not just being used by state actors and militaries: drone proliferation means that police, terrorists, criminals, and corporations are all producing complex and contested aerial geographies. From battlefield to city skyline, my research shows how drones are changing not just warfare, but power, politics, and economic forms of enclosure. 

My research documents how and why we must understand drone warfare as an &amp;quot;existential issue.&amp;quot; Drones are not just material things-they are geopolitical actors that are transforming the relationship between humans and machines, humans and the state, and indeed, are transforming the constitution of why I call &amp;quot;technological civilization.&amp;quot; This has big implications for our humanity, in ways that are under-appreciated in extant research.

My research warns that drones must be brought under democratic control and governance, otherwise they risk becoming tools of state and non-state terror across the international spectrum. This is particularly acute in an age of autonomous systems.

My research has found that militaries are changing from territorial forms of basing strategy, in which &amp;quot;boots on the ground&amp;quot; is the principle security strategy-to non-territorial, aerial form of occupation and intervention, in which geopolitical power is exercised in and through much smaller drone bases scattered across the globe.

Finally, my research has uncovered why we must incorporate philosophy in our discussion, debate, and public understanding of drone warfare. Philosophy is a vital analytic for understanding the profound ethical dilemmas, moral quandaries, and uncharted waters that humanity now faces. My research has provided a much-needed theoretical framework-drawing on the philosophy of Hannah Arendt and Peter Sloterdijk-for embedding drone warfare within deeper existential considerations: something that is missing in current journalistic, scholarly, and mainstream accounts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>My research will be of interest to academics, undergraduates, and postgraduates in political geography, geopolitics, history, international relations, critical theory, and philosophy. It will also be useful for journalists, activists, artists, and members of the wider public. This is because the project offers a fundamentally different approach from existing understandings of drone warfare. While lots has been written about drone warfare, there remains a paucity of academic research on both the geographic and philosophical aspects of drone warfare. The idea of a &amp;quot;more-than-human geopolitics&amp;quot; encapsulates the diverse ways in which robots, algorithms, and other nonhumans are transforming state and non-state violence. This research therefore offers a set of ideas, arguments, and issues for re-imagining our geopolitical present and our geopolitical future. To ensure these findings are accessible and taken forward by diverse audiences, the project's key findings will be presented in documentary format. This can be used in teaching spaces and public venues.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>41B666B9-8CBB-4F48-AE2C-0B5AF94C9416</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and
