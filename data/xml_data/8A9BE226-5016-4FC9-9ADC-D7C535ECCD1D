Just like the components of any man-made machine, these proteins are susceptible to &amp;quot;wear and tear&amp;quot; and can become damaged over time. The health of a cell, and consequently the whole organism to which it belongs depends on the timely and specific removal of damaged proteins to prevent their accumulation in toxic aggregates that will eventually poison the cell. Cells have evolved a mechanism to identify and then destroy unwanted proteins, called the &amp;quot;ubiquitin-proteasome system&amp;quot;. Damaged proteins are marked with chains of small ubiquitin molecules, targeting them to the proteasomes, the cell's &amp;quot;recycling bins&amp;quot;. The failure of this system to clear protein aggregates has been linked to multiple human diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, type II diabetes and is also implicated in those involving prion proteins which cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, BSE in cattle and scrapie in sheep and goats. Conversely, over-activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been linked with various muscle atrophy diseases, it is therefore clear that proper regulation of this system is required for the maintenance of health.

Recently, a study detailing the properties of a controller of the rate at which the proteasomes operate has been published. This protein, called PI31, has been shown to both increase and decrease proteasome activity under different circumstances. However, PI31 does not act alone. We have identified a protein called Fbxo7 that is not only capable of marking proteins for destruction with ubiquitin but which also binds to PI31. Studies in fruit flies have shown that this interaction enhances the ability of PI31 to regulate the proteasomes, and flies lacking their analgous Fbxo7 protein, which is called nutcracker, have reduced proteasome activity, and causes sterility in male flies. We have found that loss of the Fbxo7 in mice also affects their fertility. Furthermore, mutations in the human Fbxo7 gene have also been linked to Parkinson's disease, suggesting that Fbxo7 may also cooperate with PI31 to regulate proteasome activity in mammalian systems.

We want to understand in detail how Fbxo7 participates in the regulation of proteasome activity in mammalian cells. We will use a variety of methods to investigate the relationship between PI31 and Fbxo7, determining whether the interaction between these two proteins affects their ability to regulate proteasome activity and mark proteins for degradation, respectively. We will also determine how the loss or over-representation of Fbxo7 in cells affects proteasome activity in cells using a range of assays both in cell lines and in an mouse model. By doing experiments to broaden our understanding of the protein degradation machinery, we hope to be able to affect and ultimately direct these processes in clinically relevant settings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The ability to remove damaged proteins to prevent the formation of toxic protein aggregates is essential for cell survival. This function, performed by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), uses poly-ubiquitin tagging of defective proteins to direct them to the proteasome, a multi-subunit protease. Defects in the UPS are linked to multiple diseases of humans and animals.
Originally identified as a proteasome inhibitor, PI31 has now been shown to enhance proteasome activity in Drosophila when stabilised by the F-box protein nutcracker. Loss of nutcracker expression reduces proteasome activity and causes male sterility. The human orthologue of nutcracker, Fbxo7, also binds PI31. It also acts as a substrate-recruiting subunit for an SCF-type ubiquitin ligases and as an assembly factor for cyclin D/Cdk6 complexes.
The work proposed here will provide insight into the fundamental regulation of the proteasome by determining the consequences of the Fbxo7 and PI31 interaction on its activity in mammalian cells. 
The questions we will address include:
-Does Fbxo7 regulate proteasome activity and is this dependent on PI31? We will utilise MEFs established from Fbxo7::LacZ embryos and siRNA-mediated reduction of Fbxo7 or PI31 expression in proteasome-reporter cell lines to determine their effects on proteasome activity.
-Which proteins affect the Fbxo7-PI31 interaction? We will disrupt the ability of Fbxo7 and PI31 to form dimers using targeted mutations. We will also test whether known Fbxo7-interacting proteins can disrupt their interaction.
-Does Fbxo7 regulate PI31 in vivo? We will use a range of techniques on Fbxo7LacZ mouse-derived tissues to determine whether loss of Fbxo7 causes loss or change of localization of PI31 or a change to proteasome activity.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate that our research will have a broad impact across academic, public and private arenas over both short and long time scales. The immediate beneficiaries of our work will include the other scientists in ubiquitin-proteasome research community who will receive new information on the role of Fbxo7 and PI31 in the control of proteasome function as we take the first steps into investigating their relationship in a mammalian setting. Our findings will be disseminated to the research community through the timely publication of our work and presentations at national and international conferences. 

Throughout the course of the project, we expect to host under-graduate and post-graduate students who will receive training in a range of molecular, biochemical, and cell biology techniques (live cell fluorescence imaging, FACS etc), equipping them with the skills required for modern bioscience research within academic or industrial research environments. We will also regularly communicate our research and experiences within academic science with the general public at a range of different events including secondary school visits in the Cambridgeshire area and in the summer school programmes for secondary school and mature students through the Widening Participation Initiatives run by the University of Cambridge. During our current BBSRC program grant we participated in the annual Cambridge Science Festival as a forum to present our work to the general public and introduce them to some of the technologies, such as fluorescence microscopy and gene cloning using easy to understand visual and interactive aids. We intend to continue to present our work and engage the public at future science festival, and we will also take any available opportunities to communicate our findings to broader public audiences through the news media. In anticipation of these opportunities, Dr. David Nelson has already received training through the BBSRC Media Course which provided instruction and practise in the preparation of press-releases and participating in radio/TV interviews for a general audience.

Dysfunction of the proteasome, whether due to an inappropriate increase or to loss of activity has the potential to impact on many aspects of human and animal health, from age-related muscle atrophy, cancer, neurodegeneration, type II diabetes and the pathogenesis of prion-related diseases. Therefore new therapeutic drugs targeting modulators of proteasome activity have the potential to be of use to combat many diseases, especially those associated with our ageing national population. We believe that PI31 may present such a target. Only by understanding the relationship between PI31 and Fbxo7 and how it impacts on the activity of the mammalian proteasome, may we be able to best determine how to target this protein for therapeutic effect. Our discoveries may ultimately be exploited by the private sector, pharmaceutical companies which, over longer time scales (10-20 years), may be of benefit to the public and the UK healthcare system through the production of new therapeutic drugs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>349379</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Cambridge</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Neurodegeneration</gtr:description><gtr:id>17CECC0D-C996-4BA2-B834-87825581FC7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet.

We extended our analysis from a single tissue type as it became apparent after creating a KO allele that the LacZ allele was hypomorphic and the homozygous mouse we were analysing and had deficiencies in multiple cell types. The overarching finding from this grant is that Fbxo7 regulates distinct, essential pathways within these different tissues. We have defined the essential functions for Fbxo7 in spermatogenesis, erythropoiesis, thymopoiesis, and neurogenesis, and found it regulates distinct pathways in each of the four cell types. However, the role of PI31 in proteasome regulation remains unclear due to conflicting reports. Our results reducing endogenous PI31 levels in human cell lines were consistent with it acting as an activator of ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. This supported previous studies on the function of PI31 orthologues in flies, plants and in yeast indicate that it is an activator of the core proteasome, regulated by hormone-dependent changes in sub-cellular localisation or by specific conditions where robust proteasome activity is required. However, in 2014, a conflicting publication reported PI31 acts as an inhibitor of 20S proteasome assembly and activity in vitro, and there is no effect on the in vitro or in vivo activity of PI31 on the 26S proteasomes. Their results suggest a lack of an effect of PI31 on overall proteasome activity, and indicate that more nuanced experiments need to be conducted. Our manuscript on Fbxo7 and PI31 in the testes is in preparation.

A consistent finding of ours is that Fbxo7 and PI31 levels correlate in all cell types tested, including the testes. However, we noted over-expression studies in cell lines showed substantial mis-localisation of PI31 throughout the cell, and therefore we discontinued approaches using non-physiological levels of expression. Consequently, goals involving experiments that required the use of over-expression of PI31 were not met. Future experiments to investigate the effect of specific point mutations will require creating mutations at the endogenous locus, perhaps with CRISPR/Cas 9 technologies. Whilst this is easiest to undertake in cell lines, given the conflicting information from using cell lines, we think experiments using animal models will be most informative. 

Our studies indicate tissue-specific or stress-induced roles for Fbxo7 and PI31, and thus future studies on their functions should be carried out in specific tissues or conditions to gain insight into their specialized biology. The KO mouse did not survive weaning, and the reason for its fragility remains unknown. However, the leakiness of the Fbxo7:LacZ allele allowed sufficient expression for the mouse to survive, and it afforded us the unique opportunity to study the tissue-specific defects and the different mechanisms underlying the pathologies in each. We propose that studies with in vivo or live cell imaging will be necessary to discover the mechanisms by which Fbxo7 choses among a wide spectrum of potential substrates that we identified to regulate specific pathways within each cell type. We believe this can be approached using techniques that allow dynamic intracellular tracking of protein-protein interactions and their associated functions. Finally, studies at physiological levels will be needed to gain insight into proteasome redistribution or activity within specific tissues or under particular stress conditions. We are best positioned to undertake future studies on Fbxo7 and PI31, being experts on its biology in multiple tissue types. We believe studies to understand how a ubiquitin ligase fulfils such a diversity of functions will set a paradigm for understanding how cells are fashioned into particular shapes and how they execute specialized biological functions and ultimately how organisms are put together using a relatively small tool box of multi-purpose proteins with which to 'design' themselves.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A key function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is to rid the cell of misfolded, damaged, or aggregated proteins, and this capacity needs to be maintained over the lifespan of an organism. Damaged or misfolded proteins accumulate within cells upon stress and during normal aging. The dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is thought to underlie certain neurological diseases, like Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. In contrast, cancer cells with their rapid cell cycles are thought to be overly reliant on higher levels of proteasome activity. Such reasoning underpins the use of drugs such as Velcade to reduce overall proteasome activity and these agents are already in use in patients. Therapeutic targeting of the proteasome either to boost or dampen its activity would clearly be of interest to pharmaceutical companies. Therefore a more detailed understanding the factors that control its activity, its constitutive and induced activity, and its prevalence in different tissue types or under stress conditions, will be important in the development of novel drugs targeting proteasomal activity.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>82A0BCF2-8A29-4971-843D-058D488D3C80</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.laman-lab.path.cam.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership in the BBSRC Pool of Experts</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0843E493-35E1-4009-A1B5-1E0031F867CB</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Mass spec of ligase used on Protoarray.</gtr:description><gtr:id>73CA3EF8-E377-43B3-B074-FD309487D8FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Not yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Fbxo7 interacting proteins</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>LC/MS on midbrain sections taken from WT and mutant Fbxo7 brains</gtr:description><gtr:id>7529F6AE-8382-4407-A128-745F7D439E25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Proteomics on Fbxo7 midbrains</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Protoarray used with SCF(Fbxo7) ligase.
