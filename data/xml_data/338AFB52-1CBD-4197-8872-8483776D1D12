While the adoption of this technology is currently driven by environmental concerns, the significant potential of electric and hybrid vehicle technology for sustainable economic growth is becoming increasingly apparent. However, in order for this technology to achieve the penetration required to become a viable mass-market alternative to conventional cars it needs to be perceived as meeting consumers' needs. Recent studies have shown that this mass-market penetration is primarily impeded for all-electric vehicles by fears over range limitations as well as vehicle cost. 'Range Anxiety' is fueled by inaccurate feedback from the vehicle regarding the remaining range available. Costs are driven up primarily by limitations on battery capacity and life, both of which are affected by the number and ferocity of charging cycles.

It is an established fact that the range of an electric vehicle, and therefore the eventual need for charging, is significantly influenced by a number of factors such as the velocity profile and geography along the vehicle's trajectory, the condition of the road or the weather. Repeatedly accelerating up a hill in a traffic jam, for example, is more load-intensive than cruising at constant speed on level ground. However, few of these insights improve the experience of the individual end-user: neither driver-specific information such as driving behaviour or commonly driven routes nor route-specific information such as traffic volume, speed limits or the location of stop-signs and traffic lights are currently exploited when considering vehicle range or battery longevity in every-day deployment. 

This project addresses these shortcomings by leveraging state-of-the-art Robotics and Machine Learning techniques for the prediction of vehicle range as well as the optimisation of battery longevity. Methods established in the context of robot navigation and perception are ideally suited to provide evolving, in-situ information on driver behaviour and route infrastructure. In concert with such a driver-specific usage profile of a car, core robotics technologies concerning robust planning and decision making can address the task of deciding when and how long for to charge a vehicle such that battery life is preserved and charging costs are minimised. Therefore, by considering how, where and when a vehicle is traveling this project will lead to improved forecasts of vehicle range as well as to more germane charging regimes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The work described in this proposal is designed to be transformational for the user-experience, economy and efficiency of electric vehicles. It will therefore have a direct impact on the automotive sector because it proposes a feasible approach to expediting the mass-market adoption of electric vehicles. Here, potential benefactors include major automotive companies with a significant stake in the electric vehicle market such as Nissan and Toyota as well as consultants to the automotive industry and policy makers such as the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL). In many cases the PI has already engaged with these companies. 

Importantly, however, the proposed work will have significant impact also beyond the automotive sector. How energy is consumed at the level of the individual end-user remains poorly understood. Advances in information engineering and technology have only recently made it possible to collect and process this information with a level of detail which will have significant impact on how energy is used, provided and stored. The modelling of short- and long-term user behaviour as well as the development of algorithms capable of exploiting it for a more efficient and economical energy management lie at the heart of such a user-centric approach and are therefore of considerable interest to both energy companies such as Shell or BP as well as providers of energy management solutions such as Bosch. 

Customising resource management to individual users will further contribute to a public awareness of how individual actions influence the power budget of the nation and therefore aid in forming a coherent and sustainable national energy policy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99190</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EPSRC Robotics, Automation &amp; Artificial Intelligence (RAAI) Theme Day</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B65B2599-31B2-48D9-8937-DE03ACA9F93A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>EPSRC are undertaking a review of our robotics, automation and artificial intelligence portfolios of relevance to Robotics and Autonomous Systems (RAS) in order to evaluate the quality and importance of EPSRC's portfolio of research and training in the area. To facilitate this we are hosting a Theme Day on the 31st January 2017 in Central London.
 
The Theme Day will involve poster presentations from holders of current and recent related grants from across the EPSRC portfolio. A panel of internationally leading experts chaired by Prof David Hogg will use the posters and discussions with attendees to draw conclusions about the portfolio as a whole. The outcomes of the review will be used to inform future strategy in the area of RAAI and will not impact on future funding decisions at a PI level. 
 
The Theme day will be an opportunity for PIs to present their research to the review panel. The day will also give attendees an opportunity to view work of relevance to RAAI from across the EPSRC portfolio and to network with leaders in the area from across the UK.
 
As a holder of such a related grant(s) (details below) we would like to invite you to attend the event.

Specifically, our approach accounts for a driver's generalised route preferences to provide up-to-date, personalised information based on estimates of the energy required to reach every possible destination in a map. We frame this task in the context of sequential decision making and show that energy consumption in reaching a particular destination can be formulated as policy evaluation in a Markov Decision Process. In particular, we exploit the properties of the model adopted for predicting likely energy consumption to every possible destination in a realistically sized map in real-time. The policy to be evaluated is learned and, over time, refined using Inverse Reinforcement Learning to provide for a life-long adaptive system. Our approach is evaluated using a publicly available dataset providing real trajectory data of 50 individuals spanning approximately 10,000 miles of travel. We show that by accounting for driver specific route preferences our system significantly reduces the relative error in energy prediction compared to more common, driver-agnostic heuristics such as shortest-path or shortest-time routes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3781AA83-E4D9-4006-8031-0A1C8BDFC2E1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>P.
