Re envisioning and reconnecting communities as eco-social formations through arts and humanities centred interdisciplinary research.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K003992/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This research funding provides opportunities for a large arts and humanities centred interdisciplinary research team to continue the development of an innovative strand of collaborative research which was conceived at the &amp;quot;Communities, Cultures, Environments and Sustainability Research Development Workshop, Bristol, 22-24 May 2012&amp;quot;. This has been subsequently developed in team meetings and email exchanges.

The aim is to develop the notion of hydrocitizenship through a multi-faceted programme of arts and humanities research in collaboration with other related disciplines - particularly geography, planning, landscape design and community studies. This research will involve non HEI partners (Landscape Institute) and will be co-developed with key stakeholders including the Environment Agency, local authorities other water/environment focused agencies. It will be located in three major national science and research contexts; United Kingdom Water Research and Innovation Framework (UKWRIF); National Ecosystem Assessment (NEA), and Making Space for Water (DEFRA 2005). The development programme will explore basic questions about how arts and humanities centred interdisciplinary research can investigate conflicts, issues and potentials relating to water resources and within communities. And from that base, make a difference in communities in terms of both social and environmental transition and resilience. Broader findings regarding the co-development of social and environmental sustainability in communities in the UK will be disseminated to both academic and policy communities. The research will focus on how a range of values, such as sense of place, can be integrated into emerging polcy/goverencance agenca of ecosystems services and cultural ecosystem services.
 
A basic tenet of this proposal is that thinking beyond the social is a vital element of any large Connected Communities initiative which seeks to address questions of sustainability. Communities are often not aware of the systems which bring them a range of ecosystem services (and risk e.g. flooding) and this includes hydro-social cycles. Water is taken as a fundamental and pressing area of environmental concern and social justice. Questions of water security (flood, drought, water quality, access, water based ecosystem services) are some of the most important facing communities today in the UK and globally. Water issues interconnect local, regional, national, and global territories, and relate to multiple eco-social interdependences within and between communities. They also ask challenging questions about what communities are, how they work internally, how they are embedded in wider networks of connectivity (e.g. in river catchments). Water issues also offer very palpable examples of how individuals and communities (human and non-human) depend on, and are linked by, physical processes. Water is a particularly accessible way to engage communities with questions of sustainability in relation to a range of high profile eco-social challenges. We also seek to explore the challenges and benefits of moving water focused research from single issue foci (flood, drought) to a holistic approach, and how can the arts and humanties research play a central part in this?</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The focus on crosscutting understandings of communities in general and how various disciplines and initiatives have considered communities and water issues (and other environmental issues) will have impact for the following stakeholders:

Those seeking to develop community well being and the effectiveness of public services and policy, and enhancing quality of life, health and creative output in relation to communities.

Private sector beneficiaries will include stakeholder organisations with interest in economic aspects of resilience particularly insurance companies and their representative bodies. 

public sector beneficiaries, policy-makers, government and government agencies will include a range of governmental and ngo agencies with interest in community well-being and resilience and also in various aspects of sustainable environmental management, including those charged with climate change scenario planning third sector agencies will include museums and other organisations which might have a role in developing and disseminating community narratives .

The emphasis on therapeutic narratives will be of interest to a range of actors who might seek to work with communities, including artists and socially engaged arts practitioners, civil society and third sector agencies involved in social welfare, as well as local communities and community organisations situated in fractured hydro-social relations.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-06-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>8560</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>originally performed in Roberts Park, for Saltaire Festival, Since also in Exeter, London, Cambridge, Manchester, Leeds</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D8266CC-07FA-4FC6-B47D-8CD4087CF943</gtr:id><gtr:impact>invited to be performed at Leeds Industrial Museum - opening of a special exhibition titled Flood Response.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Too Much of Water (Performances)</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?p=1830</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Salt's Waters is an alternative heritage tour, navigating watercourses large and small, in the district of Saltaire.

&amp;quot;Where is this paradise of swimming and surfing? - not in some remote wilderness, but in a large urban centre - Munich, Germany. There has been a policy to re-wild the river Isar through the city and to ensure other water courses are as clean and accessible as possible. In the water course built though &amp;quot;The English Gardens&amp;quot; (a public park), people swim and surf while traffic whizzes by very close but hidden.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5E9F1163-77C5-4AF2-81C4-A58D1C4BB2F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>viewed on Youtube 1724 times 5 likes (06 03 2017)</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Hydrocitizenship sketch film - Urban Water Munich</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhkVPzfxRS4</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film about the co-created 'tidal characters' Peri and Proxi - By Rough Glory Films.

This was a co-production between Multi-Story Water and the Leeds-based company, Common Chorus Theatre, which sought to respond to the major flood that hit Leeds on Boxing Day, 2015. (For further details on the making and context of the live show, see under our &amp;quot;Performances&amp;quot; tab.)

In the live version, small groups of spectators were invited to embark on a looping walk around a section of the River Aire in Leeds city centre, starting and finishing at Granary Wharf. Our actors, stationed at points around the loop, would perform their scene afresh for each new group that came past. In the same spirit, the show's six scenes are presented below as six separate videos, for you to &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot; in sequence.

This film emerges in response to community development work undertaken at Crosley Wood by Shipley's Kirkgate Centre, and supported by Multi-Story Water. The film focuses on the story of just one family on the estate, and uses water as a connecting thread, looking at the Mynards' pro-active response to the Boxing Day floods of 2015, their feelings about the canal, and - most importantly - at the their housing conditions. Plagued by damp and internal floods, the family is at the mercy of a housing authority (InCommunities) which has shown little concern for their plight. Unfortunately, their story is just one of many like it.

The 15-minute film was shot in late summer of 2016 and premiered in a public screening at Kirkgate Centre's AGM on Saturday 19th Novermber.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7D5F2A34-361E-4E3E-A925-25C5F5F995C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>51 views 1 like on YouTube</gtr:impact><gtr:title>High Rise Damp</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?page_id=1812</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Our promenade performance After the Flood - devised for Leeds Waterfront Festival in June</gtr:description><gtr:id>D0598F88-B6E7-43FA-B039-56FE39423084</gtr:id><gtr:impact>comment on blog 

Thanks for writing this Steve, I enjoyed the opening and your performance in particular. The personal stories you told prompted a thought. This may be no more than a semantic distinction but I often feel that 'the authorities' (and I have been in that position myself, so am suddenly recognising a past failing) find themselves responding to episodes such as this by addressing 'the flooding' or (in my case) 'the contamination incident' rather than the effects of the incident on the individuals (not 'the people') affected.
We must be much more aware of those human impacts - it's not the flooding that matters but the very real effects on those who are flooded.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>After the Flood (2016) Performance</gtr:title><gtr:type>Performance (Music, Dance, Drama, etc)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://multi-story-shipley.co.uk/?p=1830</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Desperate Men Theatre Company</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship Project - Bristol Case Study (Water City Bristol) Desperate Men Theatre Company</gtr:description><gtr:id>20E9767A-99C2-4119-A86D-3CEE5D113E81</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A series of performances and films.

The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority (the Authority) is a statutory body responsible for managing and developing the 26 mile long, 10,000 acre linear Lee Valley Regional Park (Regional Park) - the only regional park serving London, Hertfordshire and Essex. The Authority has a broad and dynamic remit with a duty to develop and preserve leisure, recreation, sport and nature throughout the Regional Park. As part of this, the Authority is creating a zone of sporting excellence throughout the Regional Park which includes centres for athletics, horse riding, ice skating, sailing and golf.
 
As the owner of three London 2012 venues, the Authority is playing a leading role to deliver an enduring and sustainable legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The 2012 venues are Lee Valley VeloPark, which has the iconic Velodrome at its heart and is the finest cycling hub in the world; Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre, with ten tennis courts (four indoor and six outdoor) and two of the finest hockey pitches in the country- both venues are located on Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and Lee Valley White Water Centre at Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, the first 2012 venue to open to the public after the Games and the first to open before them. The Authority is also responsible for regenerating derelict and neglected land into high quality public open spaces and wildlife habitats of ecological importance, as well as preserving the region's historical value.

Also, find out more about the Active Energy project where the outflow from part of the Three Mills heritage site will be utilized to drive a slow moving stream wheel. This will generate sufficient power for an aerator that will help oxygenate the water to counteract the effects of pollution and support the survival of fish.

The East End Canal Festival took place on Sunday June 26th at the Art Pavilion, Mile End Park. The event celebrated and promoted the canals as a community asset for the East End.
 
The turn out was great and people were very much interested in the activities and exhibition. The Festival builds on the work of the East End Canal Heritage Project, run by Laburnum Boat Club and supported by funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The Festival showcased the project's work uncovering the stories and images of the Regent's and Hertford Union Canals over the last almost 200 years, which was moving and interesting. Activities including boat trips, workshops, art exhibition and stalls captured the interest of locals. Overall, it was a very good way to relax, learn and enjoy a sunny Sunday by the canal.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leevalley.org/news/-the-east-end-canal-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hidden Ecologies - eels - creative artist led workshops with Bristol Schools</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0BF49E1-6F12-42E3-AE08-4A62ED0DEE21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Water City Bristol team in collaboration with artist Luci Gorell Barnes has run a series of workshops (6) in two South Bristol Schools on hidden ecologies of Bristol rivers with a particular focus on eels.

Extracts from the project blog

The Hidden River Festival is an free annual waterside festival, giving local people a chance to enjoy a mix of live music, food stalls, art and fun for all the family with the aim of connecting the communities living alongside the New River, which runs through Hackney and Haringey.

Lee Valley Hydrocitizenship held a cultural mapping stall at the festival and engaged with the local people about their views and perceptions of this rapid changing neighbourhood.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.leevalley.org/news/hidden-river-festival-woodberry-down</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Association of American Confernce Confernce session</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CF8075B0-6197-46A1-8B2B-5CA8C05924DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Session at the AAG 2016 conference organised by Graeme Evans with four papers by project team members

From an email 

&amp;quot;I was really inspired by your talk on Friday . I've spent some time exploring the hydrocitizens hub - what a brilliant platform! So, I was wondering whether you could put me in contact with the people that have designed the website? I'm part of an international permaculture/forest garden network and we are currently investigating setting up an online tool and it would be great to have something very similar to hydrocitizens.com.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hydrocitizenship project principles taken up by Wye Valley AONB 2016 and 2018 Festivals</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3C91391A-4235-47E8-B1E5-DCF58E88ABDF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Key principles developed in the 'Towards Hydrocitizenship' project were taken up by the Wye River Festival 2016. This is a large 2 week event which is a major element of the Wye Valley AONB's strategy for public engagement and awareness raising. The festival focused on multiple water issues and Professor Jones acted as a academic advisor in the development process of the festival and wrote a short essay for the festival programme - a free booklet - 15,000 copies distributed. Professor Jones is also advising on the development of the 2018 Festival (they are biennial)

From the 2017 Festival evaluation 

&amp;quot;WVRF2016 encompassed 28 events, at 28 venues on sites from Hereford to Chepstow.
We exceeded all our targets: Achieving 29,800+people attending events. 1,200 school children were involved in our workshop programme. In addition 1,098 children had Wye Serai school visits with the Ensemble for half a day each.
539 young people worked with artists to create the flags which decorated the Festival sites. 
A further 300+ People participated in community training/workshops. 1000 origami birds were made by over200local people from a variety of community groups which were used in one of the installations. A whole community, young and old contributed to the other installation. 
328 people took part in the walking/story project.
220+ local singers, musicians and performers were involved in the performances 
250+torchbearers were involved in the Llandogo procession with a further 
50 volunteer torchbearers involved throughout the Festival. 
In all 18 local youth theatre groups, choirs and bands took part in the performances. 
20 students form University of South Wales were involved with the project 15 of which went on to produce performances for the Festival as part of their degree assessments.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.wyevalleyaonb.org.uk/images/uploads/general/WVRF_2016_Evaluation_and_Reflection_Report_FINAL.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professor Jones Invited by RSPB and National Trust to present evidence on using arts based methods for a proposed large coastal heritage project.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5383728D-BB7B-4740-8571-E1C2C5F245B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PI Professor Jones was invited by a joint team of the RSPB and National Trust to advise on arts based methods for a new large project they are planning on coastal heritage conservation and working with communities.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B1F0BD57-8476-4148-B0DA-2B9E4D673696"><gtr:id>B1F0BD57-8476-4148-B0DA-2B9E4D673696</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ecological Citizenship Review</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9dc265c8414f2b9ffd0e73aa8a6ce38e"><gtr:id>9dc265c8414f2b9ffd0e73aa8a6ce38e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Buser M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/F8BF03A0-0BEA-4FD3-9C97-8971A44D55E1"><gtr:id>F8BF03A0-0BEA-4FD3-9C97-8971A44D55E1</gtr:id><gtr:title>Lee Valley Walk IV -
