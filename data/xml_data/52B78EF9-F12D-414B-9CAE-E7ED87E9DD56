predicting the future of the UK uplands and informing people about how they might best respond and adapt to change. It is a follow-on project which will communicate findings from the 'Sustainable Uplands' project to interested parties and lay audiences. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>After working with farmers and other stakeholders to determine their concerns about the future, scientists and social scientists gathered data and produced models. The models feature variables such as changes in the environment, human behaviour or policy such as farm subsidies, different sheep-stocking rates, heather burning practice, tree planting or rainfall patterns due to climate change. By changing these variables, the models can predict impacts upon farm incomes, water quality, carbon storage, biodiversity, and sheep, grouse or salmon populations etc. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will disseminate key findings from the models and new methods to policy-makers, upland end-users (businesses, charities, those living, working and playing in the uplands, government organisations etc.) and other social science researchers. Films, information sheets, workshops and policy briefs will be used. Information will be posted to people and will be available on websites and in upland visitor centres. There will be an effort to publicise and popularise the work using the media. &lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-13</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>100860</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Film exploring what might happen if we focussed upland management on carbon capture - contains inputs from stakeholders and scientists.</gtr:description><gtr:id>062849BD-C803-4226-8200-53911E2DF4B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>UK Peatland Code was launched</gtr:impact><gtr:title>What if managing carbon and wildlife became the top priority for our hill farmers?</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2010</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Recent rises in food prices have made us all aware how important it is to ensure daily essentials are widely available and affordable in the long term.

If we want to become more self-sufficient in food, we will need to use more land, and we will need to manage the land we are already using more intensively.

The project influenced government position on upland/peatland management and directly contributed to development of Defra actions. The findings and recommendations were used in the Defra/UNEP National Ecosystem Assessment. The project also influenced the International Union for the Conservation of Nature UK Peatlands Inquiry policy options for sustainable management and directly supported the Commission for Rural Communities Inquiry into the Future of England's Uplands, reporting to the Prime Minister in June 2010 which featured our recommendations prominently (some verbatim). A key development has been policy shift towards facilitating private investment in upland management. Yorkshire Water, for example, are investing &amp;pound;9M in catchment management change (with multiple benefits) which as a result saves an estimated &amp;pound;12M in developing new water treatment systems. We were commissioned by Defra to write a report to feed into the Natural Environment White Paper (Spring 2011) and are working closely with Defra and IUCN to develop a UK peatland carbon code to enhance private investment in peatlands for carbon capture.

Social impact has included increased awareness of the importance of upland processes for society (e.g. British Science Festival, press coverage, project films uploaded on You Tube watched 1800 times, 1204 Twitter followers, the www.ouruplands.co.uk website, a song, music video and children's story specially commissioned about the project findings) and the project was cited in the Value for Money report for the Public Accounts Committee and fed directly into the Nidderdale AONB Management Plan and their bid for a Nidderdale NIA Partnership. 

Defra staff have been influenced by our project in their policy discussions on payments for ecosystem services (PES). This was supported by our project findings plus workshops, an additional funded project on &amp;quot;barriers &amp;amp; opportunities for PES&amp;quot;, and a review of international PES guidelines to support them in designing a tender specification for the UK context (done as part of Dr Reed's placement). Senior Defra staff have also been influenced by our policy briefs and seminars on proposals for a UK Peatland Carbon Code as part of GHG accounting guidelines. They requested we produce for them a step-by-step guide to producing the UK's first regulated scheme to facilitate peatland restoration using carbon finance. PES related findings have been disseminated to upland National Parks via the UK National Park Authorities Annual Conference and a Northern Rural Network workshop, leading to a funding proposal for the UK's first nationwide visitor payback scheme across five upland National Parks. 

We have been helping to shape actions being delivered by the CRC / &amp;quot;St George's House&amp;quot; meeting on the uplands by being part of the group. The first report was endorsed by HRH Prince of Wales.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D2BD94B2-E21D-4D8A-B7BA-FF9037A73012</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Sustainable Uplands project has considered how UK uplands might change under future social, economic and environmental conditions. It has identified a range of innovative and practical solutions to help people cope with and harness these changes and has identified ways policy-makers can support adaptation in Britain's hills. This follow-on project has communicated findings from the Sustainable Uplands project to interested parties and lay audiences. Example outputs from the work include: a DVD with four short films describing the project and some findings (also available on YouTube); a new knowledge exchange website for interested parties to upload information, and exchange ideas: www.ouruplands.co.uk; a workshops for the Scottish Executive and Pack inquiry (and follow-up policy activity); a workshop for the Westminster policy community (and follow-up activity); newsletters, fliers and posters (for stakeholder community and for those attending tourist visitor centres) and policy briefing documents; workshops for three regional stakeholder communities (Nidderdale, Peak District, Southern Uplands); commentary articles in local newspapers by the research team (e.g. Yorkshire Post) as well as widespread media coverage (e.g. BBC breakfast TV, BBC Radio 4, Radio Teesdale, Radio Scotland, Guardian etc). The dissemination work led to impacts including: findings included in the official IUCN UK inquiry on peatlands; the Commission for Rural Communities Inquiry into the future of England's uplands reported to the Prime Minister in June 2010 featured many of our recommendations verbatim; and use by Natural England of our approaches and networks in the Ecosystem Service Pilot scheme for the South Pennines.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We ran three regional workshops and two national/policy workshops. Workshop presentation slides and programmes are available on ESRC Society Today. An overview report of workshop activity is available as an output. Four key policy recommendations are: 1) Link agricultural payments more effectively to provision of ecosystem services; 2) Remove policy barriers to facilitate peatland restoration via carbon markets; 3) Re-consider a levy on extractive uses of peat and 4) Establish a national partnership of upland researchers, policy makers and practitioners to share knowledge and develop a shared agenda for future research. Additional policy recommendations are provided in the two new Policy and Practice Notes available as project outputs on ESRC Society Today along with a number of short newsletters with project information and other documents suitable for tourist visitor centres. We have followed up our workshops by being invited to internal discussions within organizations such as Defra and water companies to support policy implementation and to aid decision-making involving allocation of funds in the uplands. Workshops revealed some barriers to policy which may result in exacerbating the gaps between the urban and rural communities. For example, while there are multiple incentives for the rural community to take on renewable energy generation, there is an infrastructural problem in many upland areas as the power lines are not capable of supplying the new energy generation to the grid. There are also barriers in relation to the EU Water Framework Directive which reduces the opportunities for hydropower. However, there could also be opportunities for private companies and communities to empower themselves through innovative solutions to these issues, but the policy community will need to fully engage with such issues to realize these solutions. 

The original project co-developed a wide range of scenarios for the future with stakeholders which were then explored in our modeling. However, to simplify communication of outcomes from integrated social science and science modeling we boiled things down to two extreme (but plausible) scenarios in our short films. The films i) explain the project; ii) explain what we mean by 'scenarios' (animated film) and iii) present ideas from the two scenarios. Feedback on the films has been very positive and the films are clearly leading to enhanced debate within the stakeholder communities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31E262F7-05E5-4532-A95E-6B3D46AD2372</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK peatland code launched</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6ED3DD22-B7C1-431F-A9C4-6451D5E10C6C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Formal regulation and economic instrument to support business investment in peatland restoration - run by the UK government and supported by all devolved governments.
