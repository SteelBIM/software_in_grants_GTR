Since the 1980s, the UK has seen a huge expansion of quantitative, performance-based measures across policy areas ? a trend which has more recently been criticized by the 2010 government. So what explains the appeal of targets and indicators since the 1980s, and how have they been implemented across sectors? How has the emphasis on delivery and the ?target culture? affected policy outcomes and political debate? And how feasible is it to roll back performance-based monitoring practices once in place?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Politics of Monitoring addresses these questions through analysing monitoring in three policy areas - climate change, immigration control, and defence procurement ? over a 20 year period (1994-2014). The research will be based on interviews with around 90 officials and professionals engaged in monitoring in the three sectors; and analysis of key policy documents, press releases, media coverage and parliamentary debate on monitoring practices and their effects.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

We expect the principal beneficiaries of the project to be politicians, civil servants, policy advisors, and other members of the policy community concerned about effective policy monitoring (think tanks, NGOs, researchers and private sector personnel with a stake in policy). While the research focuses on the cases of climate change, immigration control and defence procurement in the UK, its findings should have more general relevance across policy sectors, as well as for those in other national and devolved administrations. 

In addition, our analysis of the processes involved in monitoring policy problems and in setting targets, and the possible distortions arising from such practices, may benefit other types of organisation outside of government. We will be alert to findings that might produce useful parallels with monitoring in, e.g., international organisations, NGOs or large firms.

How will they benefit?

Monitoring of perfomance has become a central activity of the UK government in recent decades, and despite the coalition government's criticism of the 'target culture', this trend seems unlikely to be reversed. There remain strong pressures to track problems and legitimise policies through measuring key indicators such as carbon emissions, immigration numbers, or defence procurement costs. Moreover, such pressures are likely to increase across all sectors of policy, as governments are expected to measure and justify their performance in an age of economic austerity. Despite the importance of monitoring, however, the debate on performance and targets is characterised by often simplistic and politicised rhetoric, and lacks rigorous underpinning research. Political and media discussion often implies that the choice is between having multiple targets, or no targets at all. More informed policy specialists are keen to discuss the merits of different types of targets, e.g. more ambitious stretch targets v. easily met targets; or process v. output targets. But there is little methodical or theoretically guided evidence to support these debates. We hope that our research can help meet this need.

More specifically, we expect policymakers and stakeholders to benefit in two main ways. 

1. First, the research will provide detailed accounts of how monitoring practices have developed over the last 20 years in the areas of climate change, immigration control and defence procurement. The case studies will provide the first detailed analysis of how monitoring has developed in these areas, and how the monitoring processes that were implemented affected performance and led to changes in organisational practices. The research will lead to greater understanding of how monitoring was implemented, what kinds of targets were set, to what degree these targets were met, whether performance in general was seen to have improved, and whether there were unintended consequences (e.g. from working to target).

2. Second, these detailed case studies will be analysed comparatively to provide more generalisable understanding of the ways in which the use of monitoring can be made more effective. A taxonomy of the different types of monitoring will be developed, and we will seek to identify and understand any correlations between different monitoring approaches and efficacy. All those involved in governance activities involving monitoring - across policy sectors, and within the UK and beyond - could potentially benefit from this research.

We will achieve these impacts through a series of seminars organised with the Institute for Public Policy Research; policy briefings circulated to a wide database of user contacts; presentations at talks and conferences; and our website and blogposts. We also aim to bring our findings to a wider international policy audience through providing other academics with the analytical and theoretical tools to carry out similar research in cognate policy areas and for other national cases.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>332366</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote talk, Our Dynamic Earth, 20th September 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6F030DE5-61E8-423D-A8AF-FA5A99141E28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk at a major event on Scotland, the UK and Brexit, which was attended by several hundred participants (including MSPs, journalists and policymakers), as well as live streamed.

The network already has 95 members from across the world, and is continually expanding. It will be formally inaugurated at the annual conference in Montreal, August 2015.

We expect the network to provide a forum for exchanging information, supporting earlier career researchers and developing collaborations on this area, across the world.

The centre was made possible by the ESRC Politics of Monitoring grant, which established a strong collabroation betwen Politics and Science/Technnology Studies. The centre now has 30+ members from across the School of Social and Political Science, Business, Law, and Population Health. Boswell and Yearley bid for university seedcorn funding to establish an international research network to build on the centre's activities. We were awarded &amp;pound;40K funding, to organise workshops and events, support grant applications and 4* publications. The grant - called SKAPE-Net - also funded collaboration betwen 7 leading international institutions working on knowledge and policy, including Yale, Harvard, Graduate Institute Geneva, ARENA Oslo, Nijmegen, and Technical University Berlin.

In October 2014 we organised a launch workshop for SKAPE-Net, which discussed two main research strands for further collaboration. One of these was Monitoring, which builds on research conducted in the ESRC Politics of Monitoring project. At the workshop, we presented some initial findings from our research, and discussed ways in which we might bring forward collaboration on the politics of monitoring.

The workshop was also the occasion of a keynote talk by Prof Sheila Jasanoff (Harvard).

The workshop produced a useful exchange of ideas on monitoring techniques and their effects.

Specifically, the SNP spokesperson for immigration, MP Stuart McDonald, referred to our work in a House of Commons debate on 4th July 2016. Based on our project findings, he proposed setting a cross-party commission to foster a more nuanced and open debate on immigration, that avoids the simplistic and negative framing invoked by the net migration target. 

Mr. McDonald's intervention was informed by attending two events organised by the project team. First, an IPPR London round-table on the net migration target, in which he participated. Second, a public event at the University of Edinburgh on the net migration target, at which he was an invited speaker. He had also read a policy brief and an article in the Herald produced by the PI, which elaborated on these findings.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>577DB35C-6942-48D5-847A-48626698AB88</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Performance targets can be adopted to perform a dual function: signaling political commitment to policy goals, and steering public administration. However, the attempt to combine both functions in one target can produce various tensions and risks. Notably, targets developed as a tool of political communication can codify simplistic narratives about policy that distort organizational activity; and they can create political risks through setting unfeasible policy objectives. On the other hand, targets designed to steer organizational performance will tend to focus on more technical aspects of delivery, and lack political traction. This suggests the need to avoid targets that combine the two functions.

2. Targets may be implemented in very different ways across policy sectors. We develop a model of policy implementation based on Kingdon's Multiple Streams Approach, which theorises implementation of policy 'ideas' as shaped by two components: political commitment and fit with organizational problem constructions. Different combinations of these features yield four different modes of implementation: effective implementation, bottom-up implementation, decoupling, and non-implementation. The model is developed and refined through applying it to analyse the implementation of targets on asylum, defence and climate change. 

3. Targets can have substantial effects on how issues are framed in political and policy debates, through what we term a 'classification effect' and a 'measurement effect'. These effects imply that even where targets are controversial and/or unsuccessful, they nonetheless influence expectations about how policy issues should be framed, and about how political leaders should/can be held to account.

4. Targets can be understood as a mechanism of accountability, self-imposed by governments to enhance public confidence. However, media coverage of targets suggests that they have very limited traction in creating public trust, with media outlets relying on more impressionistic and symbolic cues to gauge the 'authenticity' and 'integrity' of political leaders.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings have potential ramifications for the following audiences:
1. Politicians and officials in public administration involved in setting and implementing targets. We suggest a number of risks and challenges in designing targets. Notably, (a) the risks of trying to use targets for dual purposes of steering public administration and signaling commitment to the public; (b) the risks of adopting ambitious targets that cannot be delivered, and the effects on public confidence in government; (c) the limits of even successful targets in eliciting public trust; (d) the potential damage to organizations of introducing overly intrusive and directive targets that do not resonate with organizational problem constructions.

2. Politicians, select committees and other bodies scrutinising government performance. Our findings suggest that even controversial targets that are contested by opposition politicians can exert an allure, creating incentives to deploy them to expose government transgressions. This can serve to normalise even controversial targets, in turn (a) distorting and simplifying the way we frame policy problems, and (b) making it difficult for even opponents of targets to invoke vaguer, less precise and qualitative formulations. 

3. Public awareness of the purposes and effects of targets. Targets are deployed in part to signal commitment and resolve to the public, thus addressing problems of declining political trust. They therefore represent a form of self-imposed political accountability. However, publics can be sceptical about these accountability mechanisms. It is important to understand the sources of public lack of confidence and scepticism about targets, as well as the bases on which publics bestow political trust. Our findings about the role of more impressionistic and symbolic cues in grounding trust could help inform public debates about the personalisation of politics, and the role of knowledge and information in political debate and public trust.

4. Our findings on the role of targets in the immigration debate have already had impact on policy-makers and politicians (see Narrative Impact section). The narrowing and distorting impact of targets demonstrate the need for a more wide-ranging and open debate on the costs and benefits of immigration, and a more nuanced formulation of immigration policy goals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>ABF7997A-1509-40BF-808A-21DF4052CE45</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.skape.ed.ac.uk/research/projects/politics_of_monitoring/publications</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK debate on immigration</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0E1E0E8B-DC0E-481A-8DA1-FBD32647419F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Expert peer review of Scottish Government report</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9E05BC7D-45CA-45A3-BCFF-4CAC6D830897</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Between August and December 2014, quantitative data was collected on the following for the period 1994-2014:
? Public opinion on policy issue salience for immigration/asylum, climate change, and defence (source: Ipsos MORI);
? Media coverage of these three policy issues in selected outlets, including coverage of targets (source: Lexis Nexis);
? House of Commons debates on the three issues, including discussion of targets (source: parliament.uk via google).
The data has been uploaded to the data archive. The following numbers correspond to titling of files:
1. Commentary on data collection
2. Public opinion data overview
3. Public opinion - line charts
4. Media coverage data
5. Media coverage - line charts
6. Media coverage data: target as proportion of coverage
7. House of Commons Debates: Immigration &amp;amp; Climate
8. House of Commons Debates - line charts

(a) contextual data to help understand how political salience changed over time, and how this might have affected the setting and implementation of targets
(b) data on how targets affected political debate, guaged through parliamentary debate and media coverage. A selection of the quantitative data from media coverage and parliamentary debates is now being qualitatively analysed.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Quantitative data for Politics of Monitoring project</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/01104576-FCCB-43F6-A053-89FD3974BD84"><gtr:id>01104576-FCCB-43F6-A053-89FD3974BD84</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ideas and agency in immigration policy: A discursive institutionalist approach</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>European Journal of Political Research</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7111f9d6206748deadebba699b6415f0"><gtr:id>7111f9d6206748deadebba699b6415f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BOSWELL C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/334B8FE8-C019-40E4-BDD6-D7C2AD8542E8"><gtr:id>334B8FE8-C019-40E4-BDD6-D7C2AD8542E8</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Tools of Policy Formulation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/08409b64d8254f165998549c592fd22c"><gtr:id>08409b64d8254f165998549c592fd22c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Boswell C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E94B1AA0-070C-4865-AF19-3E2E6E626095"><gtr:id>E94B1AA0-070C-4865-AF19-3E2E6E626095</gtr:id><gtr:title>THE DOUBLE LIFE OF TARGETS IN PUBLIC POLICY: DISCIPLINING AND SIGNALLING IN UK ASYLUM POLICY</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Public Administration</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7111f9d6206748deadebba699b6415f0"><gtr:id>7111f9d6206748deadebba699b6415f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>BOSWELL C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A7B676E4-EDF8-42C2-8B72-57D0BF0349B6"><gtr:id>A7B676E4-EDF8-42C2-8B72-57D0BF0349B6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Policies, politics and organisational problems: multiple streams and the implementation of targets in UK government</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Policy &amp;
