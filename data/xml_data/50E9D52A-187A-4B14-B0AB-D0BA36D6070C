Other members of the research team are based at the University of Stirling and have experience in addiction studies. A bereaved family member will also be part of the research team. The study aims to make a significant contribution to the bereavement and substance misuse literature, raise awareness of issues faced by those suffering this type of loss and inform evidence-based practice guidelines.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Through a combination of bereavement and addiction studies expertise involving three leading universities, Bath, Stirling and Glasgow, this research is uniquely placed to contribute to knowledge and benefit academics and researchers from a wide range of disciplines. This will be achieved through contributing to theory development in an under-researched area; research practice in coping with methodological and ethical challenges of researching sensitive topics; understanding both the role and implications of social and cultural diversity within a society and commonalities in experiences of this type of bereavement that have a global application. 

This research, by addressing two of the ESRC's strategic priorities, i.e. informing interventions and contributing to a fair society, will have a major impact on the following groups and individuals from the academic and non-academic community: 

1. Practitioners, commissioners and key stakeholders in a range of fields
The knowledge exchange between academics and practitioners that will be fostered by this research, particularly in developing, testing and validating practice guidelines, which are expressly needed (see letters of support), will maximise impact in relation to a wide range of professionals involved with commissioning, managing and delivering services to families bereaved as a result of relatives' substance misuse. These include: drug and alcohol workers and the facilitators of support or self-help groups for families affected by a relative's substance misuse; bereavement and health care practitioners such as social workers, clinical psychologists, bereavement counsellors, palliative care nurses, oncologists, doctors, clergy, funeral directors; national organisations and networks e.g. Adfam (families affected by addiction), Drugfam, SFAD (Scottish Families affected by Drugs), Cruse and the Bereavement Services Association, the Federation of Drug and Alcohol Professionals, and the Dying Matters Coalition. All these groups will gain greater understanding of the impact on family members of the substance misuse-related death of a relative and what their specific support needs are. This new knowledge will directly inform service delivery and policy for this area. 

2. Service users and families
The research will engage and impact on those who participate in the study through providing them with the opportunity to talk about things they may not have had the chance to talk about before. Furthermore, these participants will know that there has been little research done in this area and that they are helping fill a gap in knowledge, which will be used to raise awareness, enhance understanding and inform guidelines to enable support to be made available. In addition some participants will be directly involved in developing, testing and validating the practice guidelines. The interventions that these guidelines will inform will ultimately impact on the wider group of families as end users.

3. Students and those continuing professional development
This work will inform the teaching of social science courses, i.e. sociology, social policy, social work and health and illness, at each of the Universities (and at other universities), for example, in applying theory to specific social issues, such as marginalised and vulnerable groups, death and society, addiction, research methodology and ethics in relation to sensitive topics etc. and has potential to be incorporated into professional learning courses of disciplines affected by this research. At the University of Bath it will inform Foundation Degree in Funeral Services' units; at the University of Stirling, CPD units for families and substance misuse; and at the University of Glasgow, taught postgraduate units for the Drugs and Alcohol studies' programme. The research will also inform bereavement and addiction training programmes, such as those provided by Cruse, ADFAM and Drugfam.

Already an Adfam trustee, research team member Lorna Templeton became a member of this group in 2015. At the January 2016 meeting there was interest in our bereavement study and copies of the practice guidelines were made available to members who did not already have these. Since then, Lorna has met with a practitioner from a treatment service in Bristol who now facilitates the Bereavement Through Addiction support group.

We have been not only gratified but also amazed at the overwhelmingly positive response to the Guidelines, with practitioners both enthusing about the content and disseminating the Guidelines on to their colleagues. 

We distributed 2000 hard copies - mainly through conferences, workshops and other meetings - to a wide range of over 70 national and local organisations, including Cruse Bereavement Care, Adfam's regional networks of family support workers across England, NHS Scotland, Public Health England, mental health services, the Prison Service, drug and alcohol treatment providers, support services for families affected by substance use, local government, various commissioners of services, all coroners and their staff, Social Services departments etc. These and other agencies have been very grateful to receive the Guidelines and for them to be widely available.

The Guidelines are also available online. It is not possible accurately to measure number of views, but project's website received 719 visits from June to August 2015 - the period in which the Guidelines were launched. At least 24 other websites provide or link to the Guidelines, including Adfam; Addiction and the Family International Network; the Coroners Officers and Staff Association; Drink and Drug News magazine; The Independent newspaper; NICE; the Probation Service; Social Care Online; and Substance Misuse Management in General Practice. Turning Point (a drug &amp;amp; alcohol treatment agency) added the Guidelines to their staff intranet; Alcohol Concern used the Guidelines' five key messages in an online memorial project; and Public Health England disseminated Guidelines to all Local Authority Public Health teams.

A Working Group member notes that change in practice does not occur overnight and while 'learning by one's mistakes' may be an over-generalisation, developing the skills to demonstrate good practice is often an incremental process in which the Guidelines provide a useful resource. 
- A GP wrote to us: 'The Guidelines have been received very well; am circulating widely... It has started some valuable reflections. Very impressed with the tone, content, usefulness as a teaching tool.' 
- A bereavement support worker wrote: 'We have put a link to the guidelines on the website. Congratulations on an incredibly successful tangible outcome. It has been great to be involved.' 
- An addictions worker wrote 'The Guidelines were extremely helpful Most helpful were the key messages, particularly the first two covering kindness and compassion along with good practice and the use of language.' 

These last two comments are particularly gratifying as, from the start of the project, we have known that many bereavement workers find it hard to support people after a substance-related death and that addictions workers rarely provide support to families after the client has died. The Guidelines provide these workers with the tools to address this particularly difficult kind of bereavement. 

A number of researchers have contacted us wishing to access our dataset via the ESRC data archive. This reflects a surge of interest in this field by researchers as well as practitioners, and we are hopeful that our research will continue to exert influence through secondary analysis of our data by other researchers.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>89D8916D-AB85-42BE-865B-076F1BD67ECA</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1) The most important thing we have DEVELOPED is a process of engaging practitioners, from the project's conception through to after its conclusion. (By practitioner, we mean bereavement workers; anyone - police, journalists, etc - whose work brings them into contact with bereaved families; and anyone working to support substance users and their families.) i) A bereaved parent who ran an innovative support group helped us conceive the research concept and was a key member of the research team, helping us engage with practitioners throughout. ii) After completing 100 research interviews with bereaved individuals, we held six focus groups comprising 40 professionals (some of whom were also bereaved by substance use) which teased out the service implications of our interview data and revealed the value of practitioners engaging with first-hand accounts of how bereaved people experience services. iii) These implications were then handed over to a working group of 12 practitioners, chaired by a practitioner, tasked to develop practice guidelines based on our research. The Guidelines were therefore written in practitioner language, and have been both welcomed and disseminated by practitioners to an extent we had barely dared hope for. Our intention for the project to be collaborative really paid off; for example, focus group practitioners responded very constructively to learning of multiple examples of service failure, and after the project's end practitioners continue to disseminate the Guidelines and incorporate them into their own training materials.

2) Our most important FINDING is that bereavement by substance use is critically affected - for good or ill - by the mourner's experiences of services after the death. We produced a 'map' identifying over 40 services that mourners might encounter, more than in many other bereavements because of involvement by police, coroners, media and substance treatment agencies. Practitioners themselves are often unaware of how complex and fragmented the 'system' is and how confusing to those reeling under the shock of bereavement; they have worked with us to explore how to improve co-ordination and information. We also found that practitioners' attitudes and language can profoundly affect whether a bereaved person feels supported and their loss acknowledged. 

3) Though grief always depends on the mourner's pre-mortem relationship to the deceased, we found extra dimensions to this in that the death may have been preceded by years or even decades of living with the person's substance use, which some described as 'a living bereavement'. This impacted how they subsequently grieved the person's death. Mourners had often felt the stigma of being associated with substance use while the deceased was alive, so were particularly vulnerable to insensitive responses in the aftermath of the death.

4) We discovered the complexity and variability of stigma. Stigma can be actual, perceived, or self-stigma. It can motivate bereaved people to challenge the stigmatisation of those living and dying with drugs and alcohol - some wrote autobiographical books, others wrote songs and produced videos, others produced education materials about substance use, others set up support services.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our strategy has been to hand our findings to practitioners to develop in partnership with us. Our pathway to impact may be summarised as: Collaboration ? research ? findings ? working group ? guidelines ? dissemination. Not only have a wide range of practitioners widely and enthusiastically disseminated the Guidelines, but practitioners are also incorporating the Guidelines into their own training materials. Both the Guidelines launch in London 23.6.15 to a hundred practitioners, and a post-project gathering of agencies we convened on 5.11.15, have further catalysed different practitioner groups to co-operate in new ways. The 5.11.15 meeting agreed to set up a LinkedIn inter-practitioner group and to develop a Website bringing together resources from different agencies. 

As well as writing articles, the research team has contracted with Routledge to write a book Families Bereaved by Alcohol or Drugs: Experiences, Coping, Support, to be published 2017. Subsequently Jessica Kingsley, a publisher of practitioner books, approached us, and we have helped the practitioner who chaired the working group develop a proposal for a complementary book, which has been accepted by this publisher. 

The research team have given presentations on the projects' findings to a range of both professional and academic conferences.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>412E6902-F0FF-4E29-B679-E2AFD48F0169</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/cdas/research/understanding-those-bereaved-through-substance-misuse/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Online training course for practitioners</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA43A9D4-DAF4-4199-A1C6-FEBE36EAC475</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.bath.ac.uk/cdas/documents/Guidelines_Training_Slides.pptx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1832C699-08FE-4AE6-99B7-25C42CD4C83A"><gtr:id>1832C699-08FE-4AE6-99B7-25C42CD4C83A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Compassion or Stigma?
