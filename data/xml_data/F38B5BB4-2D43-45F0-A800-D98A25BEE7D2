Massive technological shifts are dramatically altering modes of food production and bringing about new environmental challenges. Recent years have seen relocation of populations from islands, colonisation of new areas of the Nile valley and implementation of new agricultural technologies. This study will create a long-term perspective of adaptive solutions and how these are relevant to the future. This will be achieved through case studies of agricultural and plant exploitation practices from ancient and present day Nile island settlements, set within the context of a temporal overview of subsistence systems from the archaeological record.

Traditionally, islands have been important locations of settlement since there are fewer areas of wide floodplain suited to traditional agriculture (in comparison with Egypt). Amara West will provide an archaeological case study for exploring how subsistence systems in an ancient town were impacted by aridity. Once situated on an island, sediment studies show a subsidiary channel dried up towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC exposing the town to windblown sand (prompting architectural amendments) and reducing agricultural land. Analysis of archaeobotanical remains recovered from well preserved architecture and features such as ovens and grinding emplacements will allow chrono-stratigraphic assessment of subsistence change in relation to the onset of localised aridity. 

Car and electricity-free Ernetta, a Nile island 5km upstream, will provide a base-line to study present-day traditional Nubian foodways and exploitation of natural local resources. Findings will be contrasted with river bank settlements subject to greater development, in terms of agricultural technology, modern materials used for house building, and access to new road networks and imports. Contemporary subsistence data and that from Amara will be placed in a broader temporal overview to create a new perspective on agricultural risk management strategies and adaptive solutions, predominantly via review of subsistence related literature. 

Research will examine: 
Can archaeological evidence inform decisions and advice being given to develop sustainable farming practices in the present and future?
Can comparisons of ancient and present-day traditional Nubian agricultural and plant exploitation practices inform us about risk management and sustainable strategies?
Were agricultural practices and access to other natural resources effected by environmental change (including climate) in the distant and recent past? 
How are changing foodways and resource exploitation patterns connected with population dynamics, and import patterns?

Research will record and promote local knowledge of sustainable resource exploitation as relevant to future natural resources management. A report will be authored (and translated into Arabic) for organisations and bodies related to sustainable livelihoods and agriculture. Research will be disseminated via conferences within and outside of academia, through peer-review papers with multi-disciplinary academic audiences, and to the wider general public, school children and academic audiences via the British Museum. British Museum outputs will include print and web media, and the development of new Key Stage 2 teacher resources. Research will support the British Museum's, and other UK government agencies', on-going work and training and cultural relations in the Arab Republic of Sudan, but will also position the Museum and University sector, with its understanding of human settlement patterns and subsistence strategies across a long timeframe, as a key stakeholder in the shaping for future strategies.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research is intended to explore how archaeological evidence combined with studies of current farming practices can provide information to inform decisions about risk management and sustainable strategies in the future. Ensuring this impact takes place is therefore a key part of the project itself. This will be achieved through producing a report for and arranging meetings with individuals working for NPOs and government bodies, such as DifD (Department for International Development) related to investigating sustainable livelihoods and food security, as well as Sudanese bodies, universities and agricultural colleges and independent consultants. The report will be in print form as well available as a free PDF, and will also be translated into arabic. 

The PI and CI will collaborate with Neal Spencer (Keeper, Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan at the
British Museum; and director of a Leverhulme Trust funded archaeological research project at Amara West). The PI and CI will also collaborate with R. Neil Munro, an independent land use planning consultant and irrigation engineer who specialises in studying the problem of sand drift, and the impact of this on irrigation systems. Neil Munro works with various institutions relating to work in Sudan, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Neil Munro is also already involved with the Sudan Archaeological Research Society (SARS), based at the British Museum. This project will contribute through providing contextual information about examples of environmental change and sand drift on ancient communities (evident in the re-arrangements of architectural space at Amara West), through ethnographic information from traditional villages about coping mechanisms, and information about changing ecology that may assist in discussions of sustainability and suitable vegetation barriers to protect against sand migration. 

The Universities of Khartoum and Dongola
Workshops and seminars will be arranged with the Faculty of Agriculture, Faculty of Archaeology and Faculty of Sociology and Social Anthropology.

UK based Schools 
Ancient Egypt is a popular topic for schools at Key Stage 2 leading to large numbers of school visits to the British Museum, participation in Museum based learning workshops and use of learning materials on the BM website. The BM has a track record of generating schools resources from fieldwork projects. We intend to develop specific learning materials that will look at Nile Valley farming in terms of the risks of living in an arid and changing environment, thus linking past and present.

The general public
In addition, the project and its work will be disseminated through other media. It will feature in an article in the British Museum Magazine (circulation 44,000), on dedicated project webpages (the Research section of the BM website which receives 8 million page views a year), and will be presented through Public Lectures and Gallery Talks at the Museum and talks to local Egyptological and Archaeological societies. The innovative nature of the project using the past to inform the future, means this project is likely to have a high profile within the Museum. As such, this is a project likely to be regularly mentioned by the Director, senior staff and Trustees in talks, reports and discussions with Government and other key stakeholders here and around the world.

We will work with the Museum's Press and Communications team to maximise media coverage (print and online press, TV, radio). The Museum has an established record in disseminating research through these channels.

A key aim of the interviews was to inventory crops grown today and in the recent past to enable comparison temporally and between villages. We have recorded crop processing techniques, land use and irrigation, seasonality, and crop uses. The research has shown that crops grown have changed dramatically over the last 100 years and several 'traditional' crops and foodstuffs were recorded that are rapidly being forgotten. These crop changes are not documented elsewhere, so a major outcome of this project is the development of local agricultural histories for the regions visited. These increasingly little used food crops include hulled barley, to some extent sorghum, and also the pulse crop 'lablab'. These older crops are more arid tolerant than the range of cash crops currently focused upon. One surprise was the extent to which local agricultural histories amongst villages have varied, and in turn how these contrast with broader country wide or regional agricultural assessments. Local trajectories of crop changes appear to be influenced by the speed of local economic development, cultural factors, and the range of soils categories around villages. The archaeological record has provided a context from which to discuss the antiquity of contemporary crops, and this helps to reinforce the proposition that maintaining knowledge of local crops is important. The use of certain cereals and pulses over thousands of years suggests their suitability to the agro-ecological context of the Nile valley and that they are sustainable to exploit. These previously little reported agricultural changes create a new modern reference point from which to think about the longer history of crop use in the archaeological record. The ethnographic results throw light on the importance of discussing what is 'traditional' or not 'traditional' when considering any comparison with past practices. Research at Amara West has helped to characterise the agricultural economy of the late 2nd millennium BC. The focus on ancient and modern Nile Islands has provided a means from which to better understand the archaeological and archaeobotanical remains from Amara West through a period of known environmental change. A surprising find has been that there are fewer projects around the world focusing on endangered crops or recording the local loss of crop diversity than expected. It was initially more difficult to find contacts to distribute results to (outside of academia and Sudan) than expected because of this, and also because such projects tend to cross-cut varying academic disciplines, categories of global organisations, and are often local initiatives organised by small NGOS. Through attending interdisciplinary events on food security that were attended by NGOs and other professional practitioners, it was however possible to make contacts facilitating the dissemination of research findings to these broader audiences, including being invited to participate in the creation of a new network on the topic of forgotten crops.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Project results and resources will contribute to debates concerning agricultural risk management, natural resource sustainability and the role of traditional ecological knowledge and be relevant to agricultural research institutions, government and non-government organisations within and beyond Sudan. Looking to the future, the project highlights how archaeobotanical and ethnobotanical information can contribute to present-day concerns about the environment, sustainability and climate change. Looking to the past, the results are relevant to the sub field of ethnoarchaeological enquiry, including through querying what is 'traditional' or not 'traditional'. Archaeobotanical results from Amara West will contribute both to the agricultural history of this region, and a better understanding of ancient Egyptian colonial settlements and local Nubian practices. An online British Museum exhibition 'Ancient Egypt and Sudan: a guide to farming in the Nile Valley' created for schoolchildren will have an ongoing contribution as an educational resource and will be able to be used by teachers remotely from the museum.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>1A7EC571-CBEA-4DBB-9FA7-88C2948F31B8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Modern plant specimens were collected during fieldwork in the study region, and have been deposited in the herbarium at Khartoum University and an equivalent collection was also brought back to the UK.</gtr:description><gtr:id>09DF79F5-440C-4BF9-877B-70A57A658F11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collection of a modern reference collection is an essential part of undertaking ethnographic research into plant diet in order to determine specific plant identifications.
