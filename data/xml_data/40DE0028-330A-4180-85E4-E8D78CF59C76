The circadian timing system in mammals, including humans, consists of a 'master' clock within a part of the brain called the hypothalamus and many 'peripheral' clocks found throughout the body. There is increasing evidence to show that abnormal timing of these clocks leads to defects in normal biology. The effects of this abnormal timing can be short lived (e.g. in jet lag) or present over a number of years (e.g. in shift workers). In the second scenario, the long term effects of abnormal rhythms is thought to be a causative factor in many industrial accidents and can lead to increased incidence of major contributors to ill health, such as heart and metabolic diseases. In order for our internal clocks to be matched to external changes in the environment, they are synchronised by various environmental time cues. Although it is known that light is the main synchroniser of the 'master' clock in the brain, the synchronisation of peripheral clocks is poorly understood. Evidence from animal studies suggests that the time of feeding is an important signal for peripheral clocks. However, these animal experiments have not been performed in humans because; 1) very few places in the world can perform well controlled human circadian experiments, and 2) it is difficult to obtain multiple samples of human tissue other than blood. At the University of Surrey, we have the benefit of excellent human biology facilities, experts in circadian rhythms, and experts in nutritional science. Moreover, in our recent research, we have optimised a method for taking multiple samples of fat from human volunteers. We therefore propose to conduct a set of extremely important and timely experiments to discover whether the time of feeding can regulate human clocks. The results of the work will have important implications for scientists and the public. Scientists will learn crucial new information about the basic biology of body clocks. If food is found to be able to regulate circadian timing then this would identify novel treatment strategies that may lead to novel dietary interventions to reduce the burden of shift work and jet lag on health and performance. There has been a lot of public and media interest in both body clocks and nutrition over recent years and so this research is likely to be of broad interest. In particular, we hope to discover new scientific findings that will underpin non-drug treatment for sufferers of circadian disorders including air travellers, shift workers and the totally blind.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The mammalian circadian timing system consists of a master clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and many other peripheral clocks throughout the body. Light is thought to be the predominant time cue (zeitgeber) for entrainment of the SCN, which is then thought to synchronise the peripheral clocks via as yet poorly defined mechanisms. One of the primary candidates for entrainment of peripheral clocks is timed feeding. It has long been known in animal experiments that temporal restriction of food availability induces various circadian changes, e.g. food anticipatory activity. Moreover, molecular studies indicate that temporal food restriction has a profound effect on the phase of peripheral clocks. However, there are very few data investigating the effect of timed feeding in humans. In this study, we will conduct two key experiments; firstly the construction of a phase response curve to food, and secondly a meal shift protocol. These experiments will for the first time test the hypothesis that timed feeding entrains human circadian clocks and will study a combination of endocrine and molecular markers of both central (SCN) and peripheral clocks. Furthermore, the second experiment will compare the relative ability of light and food to entrain central and peripheral clocks. Our ability to measure human peripheral clocks is demonstrated by our published data on leukocyte gene expression and our recent unpublished study that has pioneered the use of serial adipose biopsies in circadian biology. These experiments will provide a timely and high impact addition to the fields of chronobiology and nutrition/metabolism. Moreover, they will have clear relevance for sufferers of circadian disorders including air travellers, shift workers and the totally blind.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will provide impact in many key areas identified by the BBSRC; 1. Scientific advancement and supporting excellent research in the science base. The understanding of circadian physiology and its underpinning molecular biology has been an area of major development in the biosciences. It is now appreciated that circadian rhythms interact with many essential biological processes and circadian dysregulation is believed to be an important contributor to multiple disease states. One important area of circadian manipulation that is still poorly understood is how timed feeding regulates human circadian physiology. The combination of the University of Surrey's state-of-the-art facilities and our recent technical developments now permit us to undertake these key experiments. This project will therefore provide major scientific advances that will be at the cutting edge of circadian and nutritional biology. 2. Knowledge and knowledge economy. In addition to its detrimental effect on health, circadian dysregulation in shift workers is thought to reduce performance and may be an important contributor to industrial accidents. By investigating putative mechanisms to reset human circadian rhythms, our study will provide novel knowledge that has the potential to improve worker performance and therefore produce great economic benefit. 3. Training and delivering highly skilled people. We have proposed a named postdoctoral researcher in this application to maximise the efficiency of the project. Although the individual concerned has some of the key skills required to complete the work (e.g. subject recruitment, conducting human trials, data analysis), she will greatly expand her theoretical understanding of circadian biology and also learn a great deal of new practical skills. She will therefore mature into a highly trained researcher who will be able to continue her career in either academic or industrial research. 4. Policy development. The new scientific understanding that will derive from this work has great potential in the development of policy surrounding lifestyle and occupational health. For example, demonstration of the ability of timed feeding to reduce internal circadian desynchrony could inform future research and policy relating to the minimisation of the risks associated with shift work. 5. Public engagement, public health and societal issues. It is anticipated that the current application will also be of great interest to the media and public, so providing opportunity for public engagement. All of the applicants already have experience of public engagement, ranging from newspaper interviews to television appearances, and would be extremely willing to continue this work. As well as providing an interesting scientific story, the research also relates to public health and contemporary societal issues, including nutrition and energy balance. 6. International development. As many of the issues mentioned above (e.g. shift work, energy balance, and scientific advancement) are relevant internationally, the research should have wide-reaching impact both within and outside the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-04-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>962717</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bath</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Engagement with Nestle and University of Bath</gtr:description><gtr:id>1275D070-B468-4C7B-9EFC-490B15682C60</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs are yet available, although conference abstracts have recently been submitted and at least 1 major publication should be published in 2016.

1. Novel scientific findings. We've provided detailed analysis of the effects of feeding time on multiple aspects of human physiology including; hormone rhythms, gene expression in different tissues, subjective appetite/behavioural scores. These data should be published during 2015 and are anticipated to make a major contribution to the literature.

2. Development of novel collaborations with industrial and academic colleagues. I have been involved in a series of meetings with colleagues at Kellogg and multiple universities. This has lead to a collaborative experiment with one of the academic partners and consultancy work with Kellogg. I am actively pursuing further links with these individuals.

3. Experience of research management. Although I had previously run smaller human trials and been a co-Investigator on large human studies, this was the first large human study on which I've been PI. The process has been challenging and also rewarding, as I have learnt a huge amount and the experience gained will greatly help me to run future projects.

4. New technical skills in the laboratory. Completion of the project required successful implementation of experimental methods that were new to me and other members of the team. These included measurements that were not included in the original grant proposal, e.g. temperature, interstitial glucose and subjective questionnaire data.

5. Follow-on funding. The project has directly enabled me to obtain a new funded PhD studentship and explore funding links with industrial partners. I anticipate that publication of the data will also greatly assist future funding applications.

6. Production of software to aid diet design. At the start of the study, we produced new software to enable design of controlled diets tailored to individual needs in a long-term residential study. This software has already been used by two other Surrey studies and will be made freely available as an attachment to a publication.



To what extent were the grant objectives met?

The main objectives of the grant were;
1. Construct a Phase Response Curve (PRC) to timed feeding in humans.
2. Investigate the effect of a 6-hour shift in meal times on central and peripheral circadian rhythms.

Laboratory work for both objectives is now complete and we are completing final data analysis before publication of the resulting papers. I have deliberately delayed publication in a strategic move to ensure that the core papers from the grant are as comprehensive as possible and thus achieve greatest scientific impact.

In addition to the main objectives described above, we have produced many other data and/or outputs that will be made available in the near future. These include the diet design software mentioned above, detailed physiological characterisation of an 'ultradian routine' protocol, addition of data sets not described in the original grant proposal (see 'new technical skills in the laboratory' above) and the ability to extend other aspects of the project via the associated PhD studentship.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>How might the findings be taken forward and by whom?

The scientific field linking circadian rhythms and sleep physiology with metabolism and nutrition is an extremely active and topical area of international research. The scientific outputs of this study will therefore be of immense interest to many research groups around the world. This interest will in part be stimulated by recent presentations by me and members of the research team, in addition to future presentations that I have been invited to give at major conferences in e.g. Boston and Edinburgh.

The timeliness of the work also makes it very popular with the media and I will ensure that media coverage of forthcoming outputs is maximised via our University's Media Relations team and other vehicles, such as the Science Media Centre.

Finally, the work is demonstrably of great interest to the food industry, as demonstrated by my existing links with Kellogg and possible future links with Nestle and smaller research institutions. I will explore these industrial opportunities with existing contacts and also by collaboration with nutritional scientists at Surrey and potentially elsewhere.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4A4EE9B1-1469-4EAE-8C0D-6C70CAD92A47</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs><gtr:productOutput><gtr:description>Bespoke forceps were designed by the lead clinical at the Surrey Clinical Research Centre for the purpose of taking repeated adipose biopsies (see section on new research methods for detail)</gtr:description><gtr:id>EEBA78D3-5B65-4E1F-A247-71EE6408F77E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>n/a</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Refinement.
