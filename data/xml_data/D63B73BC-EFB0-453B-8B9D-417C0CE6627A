We use deltas in South and Southeast Asia as our research object. These deltas are dynamic and densely populated environments typified by agricultural intensification, rapid urbanisation and vulnerability to the effects of climate change. Recognition of the existence of multiple (definitions of) deltas informs the main project hypothesis: much delta knowledge used in the South comes from specific epistemic communities, whose knowledge travels through and because of global development-cooperation networks. We trace these networks and travels through space and time to critically examine how delta knowledges are generated and gain authority, and their hybridisation with 'local' knowledge and governance practices. We do this for four deltas with diverging cultural and historical trajectories and contemporary dynamics: the Ganges-Brahmaputra and the Mekong serve as contrasting reference against which the Chao Phraya and the Irrawaddy will be studied in greater detail. Engaging with contemporary debates in STS, the analyses will be used for a re-consideration of expertise and the role of experts in dealing with uncertainties. This in turn will inform the formulation of guiding principles for productive and responsible ways of environmental knowing and planning at different scales.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Expected academic output
The academic output of this project will consist of three main categories: articles published in academic journals (such as Geoforum; Science, Technology &amp;amp; Society; Science, Technology &amp;amp; Human Values; Regional Environmental Change), presentations at academic conferences and a jointly edited book. Articles will be produced about the works done in the various activities under WP1, WP2 and WP3, (co-)authored by project team members. The jointly edited book (WP4) will take shape predominantly in the last year of the project, integrating our findings, and through the organisation of a semi-open workshop with selected contributors.

Expected non-academic output &amp;amp; dissemination of knowledge
In addition to several research articles to be published in international journals, one of the results of WP3 will be the building of the capacity of local universities' research staff (notably Chang Mai University and the Asian Institute of Technology, Bangkok) in designing and implementing a participatory modelling approach for supporting consultation and decision-making about natural resources management. 

The project will inspire new dialogues and initiatives for more democratic ways of producing and sharing knowledge and making decisions about how to deal with uncertainties in developing-country deltas. To ensure relevance of the research for 'real world' delta problems, the project will install an advisory group or 'sounding board', consisting of delta-planning professionals and academics involved in the four deltas and/or in deltas of 'origin'. The sounding board will, when possible, be present at the yearly progress workshops and will be asked to share their ideas and feedback about the project. In the end the sounding board will be involved in the formulation of the guiding principles. Various persons involved in currently ongoing delta planning processes have already shown a keen interest in being members of this sounding board. Through adjoining projects, the various project partners have already established close links to such processes. 

A project website with blog functionality will be used for the regular communication of the on-going research activities by the various project team members.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>457451</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/64A57A3D-2D3B-488B-8FD7-A3AF2F800FAF"><gtr:id>64A57A3D-2D3B-488B-8FD7-A3AF2F800FAF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Past floods and anticipating futures: Thailand and its post 2011 flood responses</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5533c8314ab8f85ed90a80e18a32bf56"><gtr:id>5533c8314ab8f85ed90a80e18a32bf56</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hogendoorn D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/N018834/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3367A4B0-EBD4-4FD9-8351-3A2F206BD2AF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Anthropology and Development</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E88ECDEE-D58E-417E-A379-9FBB35647A90</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Science and Technology Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
