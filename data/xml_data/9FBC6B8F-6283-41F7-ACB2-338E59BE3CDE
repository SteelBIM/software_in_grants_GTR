The world's oceans and seas are home to highly diverse ecosystems and are characterised by the richness and abundance of species. Marine ecosystems provide a range of important services to mankind including food production, climate regulation through the cycling of carbon and other macronutrients, and a range of cultural values (e.g. recreation, tourism). They are in serious decline, primarily as a result of over-harvesting, pollution, and the direct and indirect impacts of climate change. In many locations, pressure from human activity and climatic changes have been associated with dramatic shifts in species composition, known as phase or regime shifts, which are often long lasting and difficult to reverse.
Our understanding of the ecosystems of the UK's coastal and shelf seas is limited and many processes are poorly understood. For example changes in the physical and chemical environment (temperature, circulation, light availability, nutrients) mainly affect algal growth and thus impact the foodweb through bottom up control, whilst impacts such as harvesting act on fish which modify the biomass of lower trophic levels thus altering the controls from predation. However the relative roles of these processes and hence the extent to which environmental change cascades through marine food webs and affects ecosystem services requires elucidation. 
Our challenge is to further develop the existing ERSEM-NEMO modelling framework to better represent biodiversity-relevant processes, flows and feedbacks over a range of spatio-temporal scales, and to be able to model changes in function and the consequences of such changes in the context of ecosystem services. Furthermore these modelling tools need to be suitable for testing the impact of potential management solutions, such as marine conservation zones, on the structure and function of marine food webs across scales, and to explore the efficacy of specific indicators of good environmental status. 
A big challenge in modelling marine ecosystems is to capture the hierarchical nature of biodiversity and hence to explore a range of scales. This requires a scalable model system, with a traceable hierarchy whereby more complex foodweb structures can be systematically and coherently related to simple foodweb structures. The project will provide new modelling tools which provide estimates of crucial information to help resolve key scientific questions as well as provide a better understanding of the marine ecosystems as they respond to global change and direct anthropogenic pressures. The combination of predictive tools and new knowledge will underpin the development and implementation of marine policy and the implementation of marine forecast systems.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact Summary

How will they benefit from this research?
Policy-makers/agencies
The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) (MSFD) requires EC member states to develop strategies to achieve a healthy marine environment and make ecosystems more resilient to climate change in all European marine waters by 2020 at the latest. The strategies must contain a detailed assessment of the state of the environment, a definition of &amp;quot;Good Environmental Status&amp;quot; (GES) at regional level and the establishment of clear environmental targets and monitoring programmes. Defra, Marine Scotland and AFBI are responsible for the implementation of the MSFD in UK and will benefit from improved knowledge and predictive skill for key indicators of the state of the marine environment. In addition by addressing productivity at the lower trophic levels of the marine food web, including forecasting to century-scales, our research may assist the development of marine fisheries policy and approaches for working towards an ecosystem-focused approach to marine resource management. Cefas are key to this engagement, having for many years advised and Defra (and more recently the MMO) on the environmental status of UK waters and are advising on the implementation of the MSFD and the CFP in England and Wales.

Eutrophication modelling and Descriptor 5 of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive' was held on 20-21 January 2016 in Brussels, Belgium, jointly organized by DG Environment and DG JRC (IES -Water Resources Unit) within the framework of the Administrative Arrangement NoENV.C.2/2015/070201/705766 (Deliverable 2.2) and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MFSD). The aim of this workshop was to learn about existing modelling work and to draw lessons for the build-up of the European modelling effort. In this context, the workshop consisted of 18 presentations on the use of marine ecosystem models to address indicators within the Eutrophication descriptor (D5) of the MFSD in coastal zones and European regional seas, including assessment, indicator development and scenario building. Some other descriptors were also covered by the presentations and discussions. The presentations dealt with (1) South European regional seas (Black and Mediterranean Seas), (2) Atlantic shelf areas, (3) North Sea and Baltic Sea and (4) General lectures. The workshop also served as the inception meeting of the newly created informal network of experts on the Modelling of the European Marine Environment (MEME).

Abstract: 
In nature, part of the impact of environmental change on ecosystem functioning is cushioned by changes in species composition and by genetic evolution: the community adapts. These responses can reduce the sensitivity of mass and energy fluxes to change - a key parameter in climate change research. The potential influence of these responses is greatest in the ocean, where the cycling of matter and energy is dominated by small, fast reproducing species. However, the models that routinely predict the response of marine systems to climate change do not describe species diversity and evolution in any detail, and are not easily amended to do so. Recent &amp;quot;trait-based&amp;quot; approaches provide a conceptual framework for the modelling of species diversity, but their present implementations remain computationally expensive and unsuitable for the dynamic introduction of new types, implicit in genetic evolution. I discuss how these problems can be addressed by leveraging concepts and methods from the field of &amp;quot;adaptive dynamics&amp;quot;. By describing the intra- and interspecific diversity in terms of the distribution of a few key traits, the dynamic structure of the ecosystem can be modelled with a few variables. As shown with a canonical ecosystem model in a spatially resolved world ocean, this approach remains viable in the presence of advective and diffusive transport of biota, and smoothly incorporates genetic evolution as another source of biodiversity, linked to reproductive effort. These provide a starting point for the modelling of species diversity and evolution in computationally efficient manner.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) development (Plymouth Marine Laboratory, Cefas) Development of a new modular structure for ERSEM has been ongoing throughout MERP. This allows scientist to remove, add, and duplicate modelled organisms to improve representation of key species and get a clearer picture of the functional biodiversity for a specific ecosystem and/or location. An exciting new development is a size-based module which will represent fish populations. This achievement is a major step forward within the marine ecosystem modelling field, as existing models focus either on the lower or upper trophic levels, and combination of both requires extensive coupling work between two models. Now it will be possible to run ERSEM for the whole of the food web, giving ERSEM a unique ability to explore impacts of climate change and human activity on the whole ecosystem, and resulting impacts on ecosystem functioning (clean water, food supply) and the diversity of marine species.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Model code is open source and can be accessed from http://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Access_Code</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>20943B2C-0F7A-4DD6-90ED-9CBD7FF331E0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.pml.ac.uk/Modelling_at_PML/Access_Code</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of data regarding traits of zooplankton to later develop a trait based approach for expanding representation of zooplankton in FABM-ERSEM in order to improve diversity and representation of key functions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA859759-5F28-4EB8-A2C7-D87FAF31AAD1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Improved communication and linkage with the experimentalist community.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Zooplankton traits</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Framework combining size and trait based modelling for zooplankton representation within FABM-ERSEM.

 FABM enables complex biogeochemical models to be developed as sets of stand-alone, process-specific modules. These can be combined at runtime to create custom-tailored models. This approach has been adopted to implement several large ecosystem models in FABM, including ERSEM (marine), and AED and PCLake (freshwater). FABM has also been used to model suspended sediment and redox chemistry.

 FABM has been coupled to several hydrodynamic models, including GOTM, GETM, GLM, MOM4 and MOM5. It also comes with a stand-alone box model driver.

 FABM uses modern software standards: it is coded in object-oriented Fortran 2003, has a build system based on CMake, and uses YAML files for configuration.

FABM makes it easy to partition complex biogeochemistry over many building blocks, called &amp;quot;model instances&amp;quot; in FABM.
