These changes have significant implications in terms of the types of roles that public servants undertake and their career trajectories. The existing knowledge and practice around career development of public servants is yet to catch up with these developments.There is no common and shared route through which public servants (broadly defined as all those working in public services) are developed or through which they can gain access to information about the types of roles available and the skills and competencies they may need to develop.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project is a Knowledge Exchange between the University of Birmingham and Birmingham City Council and aims to:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>critically appraise the existing knowledge base on this topic&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>undertake new research into public service roles, through interviews with 30 people working in Birmingham or in national career development roles&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>establish a knowledge portal which will support public servants and public service organisations in acquiring the skills and knowledge they need.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit?

The main beneficiaries of this project will be those public servants taking part in the research process and those who access the knowledge portal resource. This will also be of benefit to the public service organisations who employ public servants and policy makers who support local and national organisations in the development and support of public services and their employees. 

Organisations involved in the professional development of public servants, including education providers, will also benefit from this project, as should students who are looking to enter into the field of public service. 



How will they benefit?

Public servants should get an improved insight into roles, improved access to resources and sources of support and ultimately improved skills and career development. They should also ultimately have better and more appropriate skills and education training opportunities. 

Public service organisations and policy makers should have a better understanding of the types of career trajectories of its employees and those from other institutions and sectors who may at some point work within their organisations or work with them from partner organisations.

Education providers, organisations involved in the training and development of public servants and students should benefit from better understanding of the skill and training requirements of public servants.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>35649</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Research Society for Public Management, annual conference: 'Re-imagining the 21st century public servant'</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EE83604-BBFE-4E6F-9163-BE61E780B060</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Closing plenary of IRSPM conference on key challenges facing 21st century public servants, which used our research as the organisation theme, with one of the illustrations from our research as the backdrop

The research findings were reported as 10 themes which organisations delivering public services could use to shape their strategic workforce development. There has been a large amount of interest in our work within the local government sector. We have been invited to present the research themes at around 35 conferences and events so far, nationally (including Scotland and Wales), regionally and in individual localities. A further 10 invitations are pending and we continue to receive invitations on a weekly basis. 

The events have focused on local government audiences, although we have also spoken to health, fire and police organisations. Some of the events have been delivered as part of professional development activities for local or regional public service workforces. Although the original research plan focused on developing a knowledge portal, the strong steer we have had from the local government sector is that the best way for us to realise impact is through sharing with them our distillation of the themes drawn from existing knowledge. In particular, audiences have engaged with the illustrations that we use to highlight the 10 research themes. 

The Local Government Association (LGA), the Society of Local Government Chief Executives and the Public Services People Managers Association have set up a national steering group to work with us to promote implementation of the research themes within local government. Six local authorities have formally committed to using the research within their strategic workforce redevelopment, including the Knowledge Exchange partner (Birmingham City Council). At the request of one council we have developed a 360 degree feedback exercise based on the themes from the research. This was undertaken by the executive leadership team and the results fed back to individuals and to the leadership team as a whole. Two further councils are about to undertake the 360 exercise and the questions have been made available to all councils via the LGA's Knowledge Hub. The steering group meets regularly with the six local authorities to share learning on how they are using the principles from the research in their strategic workforce reform. The steering group are also collecting evidence about the extent to which other councils are using the research as a framework for their workforce development. West Midlands Police are keen to work with us to develop their leadership approach based on the research. 

We were asked by the LGA and the North West Regional Employers Association to develop a parallel set of resources for 21st Century Councillors, which is one of the areas not covered by the original research. The North West Regional Employers used their contacts to arrange interviews with a range of councillors and to develop a programme of training for elected councillors, based on the findings from the work. The LGA involvement has provided a national platform for this work beyond the North West.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3B52D7CC-5CD5-4BD8-8508-54225FCC4EFB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Drawing on the literature review and fieldwork undertaken for the project, we have identified ten key themes shaping the development of the public service workforce (within the public, private and third sectors). These cover roles, skills and competencies, and inform the support, development and training requirements of the work. The themes are future-looking, reflecting the trajectories that people working within public services are experiencing. The themes are: 
The 21st Century Public Servant...
? ...is a municipal entrepreneur, undertaking a wide range of roles 
? ...engages with citizens in a way that expresses their shared humanity and pooled expertise
? ...is recruited and rewarded for generic skills as well as technical expertise 
? ....builds a career which is fluid across sectors and services 
? ...combines an ethos of publicness with an understanding of commerciality 
? ....is rethinking public services to enable them to survive an era of perma-austerity 
? ...needs organisations which are fluid and supportive rather than silo-ed and controlling 
? ...rejects heroic leadership in favour of distributed and collaborative models of leading 
? ...is rooted in a locality which frames a sense of loyalty and identity 
? ...reflects on practice and learns from that of others

2. In order to assist central and local government in better supporting and promoting public service careers, we have developed ten challenges (matching the ten themes above). They aim to stimulate reflective dialogue within public service providers and stakeholder organisations to enable them to move in the direction of the ten themes set out above. The challenges are framed as questions such as: 

? Do recruitment practices get the right balance between generic and technical skills? How can people be recruited on the basis of values as well as skills? 
? Career development: What opportunities can be created to encourage sabbaticals and secondments, into and out of the organisation?
? Perma-austerity: are honest conversations going on about what the organisation can and can't do in an era of austerity, and do people understand their own role in that future?
? Do appraisal, mentoring and peer support give people scope for reflective practice, to share and learn from mistakes and to take on new challenges (e.g. using social media)? 

3. Consistent with the Knowledge Exchange principles embedded in the project, we have built strong links with our project partner (Birmingham City Council), which has enabled mutual learning (for example through co-interviewing). It has also continued into the reporting and implementation phases of the research, contributing to the Council's new workforce development strategy. 

4. To provide a portal through which people can access the research, link to other resources and also engage in comment and dialogue, we developed a project blog. We worked with a graphic artist to develop images to go alongside each of our themes to provide a strong visual representation of the research. We also have a strong Twitter presence, using a project hashtag. This activity has helped to build awareness of and interest in the research, as well as developing the social media skills of the project team.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are strongly committed to developing findings which will be useful to people working in public services. In particular we are focused on getting the work taken forward by those parts of public service organisations that focus on organisational design, workforce strategy, human resource management and education/professional development. We are confident that our project partner (Birmingham City Council) will utilise the findings in its workforce recruitment and development (following a commitment from the Chief Executive). We have been approached by around 20 other organisations who want to work with us to see how they can make use of the research. These span large regional bodies such as the North West Regional Employers Network and small organisations such as South Staffordshire District Council. We are working with the Local Government Association and the Public Service People Managers Association to explore how best to disseminate some of the good practice case studies that we have identified in the research. Interest in the research has also come internationally: we are partnering with the University of Melbourne to compare our results with their own research on public workforce reform. We have also been asked to share findings with the Swedish Local Government Association (SALAR).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5FDEACFE-A0C4-4D5D-AE38-76D7380AAEC8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://21stcenturypublicservant.wordpress.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1CAF2235-C553-4314-9979-699703F059AF"><gtr:id>1CAF2235-C553-4314-9979-699703F059AF</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Twenty-First Century Public Servant: working at three boundaries of public and private</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Public Money and Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b"><gtr:id>1d43d9e0438839386fccb2c77159514b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4E85B6B5-C1AC-47BF-ACDE-0D687DCDA5EC"><gtr:id>4E85B6B5-C1AC-47BF-ACDE-0D687DCDA5EC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Emotional Labour of Boundary Spanning: Evidence from the UK and US</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/247e753fa09edf4399552683b711690f"><gtr:id>247e753fa09edf4399552683b711690f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mastracci, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1F1C51D8-F122-4757-B709-7A4265E536FE"><gtr:id>1F1C51D8-F122-4757-B709-7A4265E536FE</gtr:id><gtr:title>The 21st Century Councillor</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/03fe6738f72378abcf00fc34c7eeba4e"><gtr:id>03fe6738f72378abcf00fc34c7eeba4e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Mangan, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/31DF0833-5F17-472A-BF42-775ED9A19872"><gtr:id>31DF0833-5F17-472A-BF42-775ED9A19872</gtr:id><gtr:title>The 21st Century Public Service Workforce: Eight Lessons from the Literature</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb"><gtr:id>3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BBA36820-82AB-426F-ABAE-3F245E024DFC"><gtr:id>BBA36820-82AB-426F-ABAE-3F245E024DFC</gtr:id><gtr:title>21st Century Public Servant</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb"><gtr:id>3439a5253ed64cac17ccd1b8f205a0cb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Needham, C.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K007572/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>B8E7153C-9FE1-4987-A37B-98408DC227F3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Public Administration</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>12179D88-04B3-47E9-89E1-B5EE8F895227</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Policy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
