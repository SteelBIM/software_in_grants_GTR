These cells are not only a good alternative to animals which are currently used for heart research but also are a valuable material for treating patients with heart failure, which is a major killer to the UK people. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is essential to further understand how heart cells develop in our body before birth.

This study aims to unveil characteristics (?gene profiles?) of specific cells (heart cell precursors) in the embryo which are changing to heart cells. This very important information has not been achieved due to technical limitations of previously-available methods because such cells are extremely small in number. This study will solve such difficulties by using a combination of state-of-the art technologies. In the experiment, a single individual cell of interest will be isolated and collected from embryo under microscope, and the genes included in the cell will be amplified using a newly-established molecular biological method so that the amount of the genes become sufficient for assessment. Then, amplified gene expression of each cell will be assessed by using the latest, extremely powerful analyser. 

The data obtained will provide a range of new important knowledge regarding how heart cells are developed in the body, which will in turn suggests how to produce heart cells from stem cells in the laboratory. Moreover, this information may open a door to new research. We may be able to generate heart cells from patient?s own cells such as skin cells by applying the information obtained in this study. Thus this research project will gratefully contribute to the progress in medical science and to development of new therapies for heart failure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Generation of cardiomyocytes in vitro is no doubt valuable for progressing scientific research as well as developing myocardial regeneration therapy. However, it is not yet possible to produce a pure population of cardiomyocytes in sufficient quantities, even if embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells are used. This is due to the deficiency of key information regarding early cardiomyogenesis. Most importantly, gene expression profile of cardiomyocyte progenitors and its changes during differentiation remain largely unknown because of technical difficulties. In particular, collection of a sufficient number of cardiomyocyte precursors from embryos without contamination from irrelevant cell types was almost impossible due to the small number of cells of interest and lack of appropriate cell-identification markers. 
This project thus aims to establish comprehensive gene expression profiles of cardiomyocyte progenitors at each stage of early cardiomyogenesis in mice by using the latest technology, single-cell cDNA construction. Recent advances in molecular biology has enabled the production of high-quality, linearly-amplified single-cell cDNA applicable to genome wide analysis, and I have mastered this technique. By this sophisticated method, I will be able to obtain cDNA of single cardiomyocyte precursor at each differentiation stage without contaminations. Heterogeneity among the same cell population can also be clarified by this method. In addition, generated single-cell cDNA will be assessed using a state-of-the-art technology, Digital Gene Expression Profiling by Illumina next generation sequencer which has recently been established in our centre. Digital Gene Expression Profiling is known to have advantages over microarray in robustness, resolution, sensitivity and reproducibility in analysing expression profiles. 
 The obtained results will clarify the characteristic expression profile of cardiomyocyte precursors, which can serve as a ?fingerprint? to evaluate the precise stage of differentiation. The heterogeneity of cardiomyocyte precursors will also be elucidated and will suggest the precise timing of the cell fate determination with loosing multipotency. In addition, such information may allow discovering novel marker genes and/or surface antigens specific to each differentiation stage, which could be exploited to harvest pure populations of cardiomyocyte precursors at each stage. Further, I will be able to obtain the list of transcriptional factors expressed in cardiomyocyte precursors, which could be sufficient to induce cardiomyogenesis. Thus, this study will provide a range of novel important information in developmental biology which will be instrumental to initiate my central research programme (development of a method for generating pure population of cardiomyocytes in vitro) as a new investigator.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>333380</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>William Harvey Research Institute</gtr:department><gtr:description>Elucidation of the character of human cardiac progenitor cells from human ES/iPS cells.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7F4B5B42-B42D-43FE-91BD-0106EFB82196</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have confirmed that a novel surface antigen we found, which is specific for cardiac progenitor cells in mice, is also specific for those in human.
