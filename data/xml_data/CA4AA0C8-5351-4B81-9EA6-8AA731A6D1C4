Innovation and Knowledge Centre in Synthetic Biology - Collaborative Programme - Tranche 1</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/M006700/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Synthetic biology is a new and exciting research field that brings together biological scientists and engineers with the aim of developing new ways to build and alter biological systems and cells for specific applications. Biological cells can perform a vast array of activities driven by a set of instructions, which are encoded by DNA. This DNA makes up the cells genome, which acts as a blueprint for different types of cells and is composed of four complementary chemical building blocks called nucleotides (G, C, A and T) linked together in a sequence. The beauty of DNA is that these building blocks pair up specifically (G-C and A-T) thus the DNA template can be easily copied and replicated. The instructions encoded in DNA are translated specifically into an array of large molecules called proteins. Proteins can be considered the as the molecular engines of cells performing all the necessary functions for life enabling cells to live, divide and grow. Over the last 20 years advances in our ability to 'read' the DNA code has resulted in the complete genome sequences or &amp;quot;instruction sets&amp;quot; for nearly every living being on planet Earth including humans. More recent advances in the chemical synthesis of DNA, has resulted in our ability to 'write' or make synthetic DNA. Synthetic biology therefore aims to provide an engineering framework that allows researchers to design and write DNA tailored to specific applications such that these new synthetic DNA sequences can be placed in simple cells to perform specific human defined functions. One overarching aim at present is to develop a series of foundational methods in synthetic biology such as assembling complex DNA components, characterising the instruction parts in detail and computer modelling of more complex DNA designs such that these can be applied to different applications. One overarching concept for synthetic biology is the development of standardised DNA components that can used in an engineering 'design, build and test' cycle to create new biological systems and cells that display defined and predictable functions.


Many researchers, policy makes and national governments anticipate that synthetic biology will provide a range of benefits to society in different industrial sectors including human health; agriculture and food production; environmental protection and remediation; bioenergy and chemical. To accelerate the translation of synthetic biology technology to new applications we propose to establish a national UK Innovation and Knowledge Centre in synthetic biology with three main objectives:


(1) To act as an industrial translation engine which translates university and industry based research in synthetic biology into industrial process and products
(2) To be an effective vehicle for the support of small to medium sized UK companies including Start-ups in synthetic biology
(3) To actively engage in open dialogue with the public and other stakeholders focusing on the risks and benefits of synthetic biology technologies


The IKC aims to place the UK as one of the World's leaders in translating academic synthetic biology research into new products and process but more importantly under the framework of 'Responsible Innovation' where the public worth and potential risks of specific applications are considered before such applications are implemented or even reach the market. Such an approach will establish new sustainable synthetic biology industries in the UK, allow other non-UK companies to invest in the UK and develop a skilled workforce in synthetic biology all of which will ultimately lead to new economic growth</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>A number of international bodies including the British Government, the United States Government, the EC and the OECD are predicting that synthetic biology will have a very significant impact on the economy, growth and jobs over the coming years. In a policy statement in 2012, Vince Cable, the Business Secretary [Minister] stated that the &amp;quot;Government has identified synthetic biology as one of the three technologies important to growth over the next 20 years&amp;quot;.


The aim of the proposed IKC is to perform the important function of academic and business integration by creating an Industrial Translation Engine. The objective is for the IKC to create an effective mechanism to bridge the gap between university-based research and industrial processes to create products and jobs, through industry, for the benefit of the UK economy. The UK has a strong academic science and engineering base. Our plan for the IKC is designed to support existing and new companies to grow the UK sector in line with the international economic predictions for synthetic biology.


The IKC will be industrially oriented. The executive management team who will run the IKC will comprise people with extensive industrial and commercial experience - typically in areas where synthetic biology is likely to have industrial impact. Our proposed CEO will be someone with considerable senior management experience and translation expertise in the pharmaceutical industry. It is envisaged that the other senior members of the executive management team will have complimentary backgrounds (e.g. in industrial biotechnology and IT and software engineering). The IKC facility (SynbiCITE) will be located in new-build facilities at the new Imperial College innovation campus and industrial park, currently being built in West London. It will employ additional scientific and support staff. These facilities will house the executive management team and their commercial staff, and a group of dedicated staff scientists and technicians.


Since the IKC is funded through public money, we will seek to demonstrate substantial, positive academic, economic, environmental and societal impact. We will also develop the skills base in synthetic biology by educating a significant number of highly qualified staff. In the first year of the IKC, the objective is that SynbiCITE will become a nationally recognised centre with global reach, building towards critical mass. From the first year, significant number of projects will be passing through the industrial translation engine - some, producing prototypes for test and pilot production. These and others will have a large number of patents and associated IP - with a number of companies benefitting. Over the initial 5 years we expect the IKC to have significant impact in the following areas:


(i) New synthetic biology processes and products in industry (in existing and new companies)
(ii) An improved understanding of the ethical, legal and regulatory impact of synthetic biology - and an accepted framework for Responsible Innovation for emerging technologies
(iii) A significant number of new UK jobs generated
(iv) An enhanced UK skills base - academic and industrial - in synthetic biology
(v) A larger portfolio of successful SMEs and start-ups - generating substantial turnover
(vi) The UK recognised as one of the international leaders in synthetic biology (academic and industrial)
(vii) New environmentally friendly processes to develop &amp;quot;green products&amp;quot;
(viii) A positively engaged public, and wider stakeholder engagement
(ix) Increased industrial funding for synthetic biology


Ultimately the IKC will show its full impact through growing a significant income-generating industry for the benefit of the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2907114</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Life Tech DNA Synthetic Training day</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>65893A40-7ABE-4812-B154-DB4BC29B86E9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop was run by SynbiCITE and helped industry adopt new technology</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lean Launchpad Educators Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7EF3B3BF-15AE-4683-B42D-84FC2142247E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Lean LaunchPad entrepreneurship education curriculum provides an effective integrated approach that adapts these critical processes into an exciting learning journey for students and faculty alike, while helping extend the classroom into the business community and entrepreneurship ecosystem.

The government has identified synthetic biology as a key high-growth emerging technology. Synthetic biology has been described as the design and engineering of biologically based components, novel devices and systems as well as the redesign of existing, natural biological systems. It has the potential to deliver important new applications and improve existing industrial processes - resulting in economic growth and job creation.

Dstl's Prof Neil Stansfield says:

It is important that Dstl keeps abreast of such emerging technologies, ensuring that our armed forces can benefit from cutting-edge capability. Our programme champions innovation; and works with partners to explore and deliver exciting new technology opportunities for the security and prosperity of the UK.

Dstl is particularly interested in using synthetic biology to produce novel materials which might provide benefits such as enhanced ballistic protection and lightweight armour, or transparent screens and lenses which don't mist up. It is anticipated that within four years a new material for armour, or a new approach to existing materials at reduced cost, will be identified.

Dstl has been showcasing some of its work within the field of synthetic biology to suppliers at an event in Chicheley Hall in Buckinghamshire, including improved boron carbide armour and catalysts for fuel cells.

Attending the conference, Prof Lionel Clarke, Co-Chair of the UK's Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC) said:

Synthetic biology has the potential to generate innovative solutions to significant technological challenges, and in recent years the UK has invested effectively to support operations at its rapidly advancing leading edge. Events like this allow us to better understand the possibilities that are starting to present themselves, to identify opportunities for collaboration and to benefit more fully from its recent and future development.

Prof Tim Dafforn, Chief Scientific Adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) said:

This conference is a wonderful example of how government departments are working together with industry and academia, to take full advantage of synthetic biology technologies for the benefit of the UK. I look forward to seeing how work in this rapidly developing field progresses in the coming years.

The next phase of funding will be administered through Dstl's Centre for Defence Enterprise (CDE). A themed competition looking for synthetic biology approaches to produce novel materials to address defence challenges will be briefed at a CDE Innovation Network event on 10 February 2016, and the projects selected will build upon Dstl's existing programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/developing-novel-materials-with-synthetic-biology</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016,2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Engagement Workshop: London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E76E888-9939-4B21-952A-11752992E8DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Innovate UK held an Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund Engagement Workshop.

&amp;quot;I thought I knew my target market for my technology. But this programme is helping our team gain real feedback from potential customers and is dramatically changing the way we view our approach to research commercialisation.&amp;quot; - SETsquared ICURe Pilot Programme Participant

ICURe is a collaboration of the SETsquared Partnership, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), and Innovate UK (formerly the Technology Strategy Board), designed to move ideas and innovation out of universities and into the marketplace, where they will have the greatest impact.

In 2016-17, the ICURe pilot (phase 2) focusses on commercially-promising research projects undertaken at SETsquared and invited universities. ICURe will fund teams to determine whether there is a market for products or services that utilise their research, and then, where there is evidence of market demand, licence or spin-out the research into a company.

Guidance for Applicants

ICURe will fund proposals to prove market demand for research with funding of up to &amp;pound;35k for the 3 month Market Validation stage, with an additional up to &amp;pound;15k available post initial 3 months, where applicable. Applications for the funding should be made by a team of 3 consisting of:

Junior Researcher (ECR)

Senior Researcher (Principal Investigator)

Business Adviser.

ICURe will support three months of full-time, intense market assessment where Junior Researchers take on the role of the Entrepreneurial Lead, engaging with prospective customers, partners and competitors, taking steps to validate the commercial potential of their research. 

At the end of the 3 months, participating teams will present their opportunity to an options panel that will offer the team expert guidance on recommended development pathways. The options proposed can include carrying out further research, exploring licensing opportunities, seeking private funding for spin-out or, for those projects that have demonstrated strong market potential by the end of the market validation, the panel may recommend a commercial oppoirtunity exists. If this is the case, commercialisation staff from the universities, ICURe programme team members and university incubators, will work with each team so that they can be fast-tracked into creating a start-up company.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.setsquared.co.uk/research-commercialisation/applications-cohort-8-are-open</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>FORNY Forum 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51FF405C-3B9B-412F-AB67-C23E234055E8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;The Forny Forum was arranged by Inven2, on behalf of the Norwegian Research Council.

This strategic plan, published by the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC), aims to accelerate the commercialisation of synthetic biology products and services with clear public benefit, building upon the strength of the UK research base. It focuses on five key areas of strategic importance:
Accelerating industrialisation and commercialisation
Maximising the capability of the innovation pipeline
Building an expert workforce
Developing a supportive business environment, and
Building value from national and international partnerships.
It builds on the recommendations made in the Synthetic Biology Roadmap for the UK, which was first published by Innovate UK in 2012. The roadmap led directly to major funding and policy activities, including the establishment of new synthetic biology research centres, the Innovation and Knowledge Centre at SynbiCITE, DNA synthesis facilities, training centres and a seed fund for innovative companies. In addition, the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC) was founded to manage the continued growth of this field.
During 2015, the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council (SBLC) consulted a broad cross-section of businesses and the research community to develop this new strategic plan, building upon the successes of the 2012 roadmap.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2826135/31405930/BioDesign+for+the+Bioeconomy+2016+DIGITAL+updated+21_03_2016.pdf/d0409f15-bad3-4f55-be03-430bc7ab4e7e</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>BSI/'SynbiCITE white paper - The ascent of digital biomanufacturing - creating a new manufacturing industry through the development of synthetic biology standards</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D90DE17-9F5D-4FC9-AA6F-732A50D6D4AA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Influencing manufacturing using biotechnology technology through the development and dissemination of new biology metrology and standards</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.bsigroup.com/LocalFiles/en-GB/standards/BSI-Standards-white-paper-The-ascent-of-digital-biomanufacturing-UK-EN.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>PAS 246 - Use of standards for digital biological information in the design, construction and description of a synthetic biological system - Guide</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19A7A96D-9303-42E7-A084-236823958C9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>PAS 246 - Use of standards for digital biological information in the design, construction and description of a synthetic biological system.
