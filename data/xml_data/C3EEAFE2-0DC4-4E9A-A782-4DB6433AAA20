is the commonest form of glomerulonephritis worldwide. Currently the diagnosis can only be made by kidney biopsy, and a single biopsy provides limited information about the future risk of kidney failure. In addition, since this disease can run in families, there is a need for a test to predict whether relatives of patients might develop the disease. We aim to use genetic analysis, together with clinical measurements and disease markers, such as deglycosylated IgA to develop a way of predicting which patients are at risk of progression and which relatives are at risk of developing the disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A) Family-based and population-based linkage analysis
B) Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for deglycosylated IgA1 serum levels;
C) Stratification using susceptibility genetic variants (HLA haplotypes, structural variants across the CFH-CFHR);
D) Resequencing through NGS of a selected subsample of informative families 
E) Variants Validation
F) Identification of biomarkers for IgAN and Bayesian Model</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>IgA nephropathy is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis, leading to end-stage renal disease in up to 40% of patients, who thus require dialysis or kidney transplant within 20 years of renal biopsy-proven diagnosis. This is a significant economic burden on patients and healthcare system in the UK. This translational medicine project will better elucidate the pathogenesis of the disease and also ultimately provide a refined non-invasive tool useful for screening at-risk relatives and for stratification of IgA nephropathy patients in order to achieve their personalized treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>495962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Causes and Predictors of Outcome in IgA Nephropathy</gtr:description><gtr:id>E28DEB4B-D378-459E-A82B-2039F82D5E7E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Part of our project involved the recruitment of patients with IgA Nephropathy onto a study, so we could collect samples from patients who had been informed of the study and given informed consent.

IgA glycomics data have been characterised in an additional sample of 2500 twins, for which multiple -omics data (including transcriptomics, epigenomics, IgG glycomics and whole serum, whole genome sequencing, gut metagenomics, metabolomics) are available. This study, which is possibly the largest glycomics experiment on IgA to date, will identify genes, pathways and environmental factors associated with IgA glycans.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A8CFA957-57B5-4A31-A1D0-5BE01800CD3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Glycomics method for the IgA molecules have been improved and tested on IgAN case control study. Glycans involved with IgAN risk and progression have been identified.

Once the multi-omics analyses of the large 2500 twins sample will be completed we will get a better picture of how the IgA glycans assortment relates with the host genome and the gut microbiome composition, which are the processes involved and their metabolomics signatures.

Apart from clarifying the role of IgA in IgAN development these studies will provide novel insight into the biology of IgA.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>IgA Glycomics</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Assay to measure biological parameters in the samples collected from the patients in our study</gtr:description><gtr:id>7C8B23EC-9BDC-40F6-84BC-6FBEBBBE6531</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We are able to measure biological parameters including antibody levels, levels of immune system proteins and glycosylation of IgA by using the ELISAs we have set up.

famCNV is now at version 2.1. This new version allows a more flexible input, and quantile normalisation can be automatically applied to each phenotype to improve normality of the response variables. Moreover, its output includes also beta and percentage of variance explained. The significance of the results is also now tested both through formal likelihood testing and through an empirical adaptive procedure. Version 2.0 is also more efficient in its implementation, allowing multithreading. The new version allows using both family data and unrelated subjects where the kinship matrix is estimated from the genetic data.

We used famCNV to identify CNVs involved in IgAN using data previously generated in samples from the MRC/Kidney Research UK National DNA Bank for Glomerulonephritis, which are now under replication in an independent sample.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0B69D6CE-5C24-4299-B30D-08939F98BD76</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Raw intensity data from GWAS panels can be used to model association between CNV and phenotype using both family and independent samples. The new implementation 2.0 have been used to study the association between IgA and CNV in case control and family studies, and of the deglycosylated IgA. It has used also for additional projects (non IgAN) in our lab, including the identification of association between CNV at the AMY1 gene and obesity susceptibility.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>famCNV</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.twinsuk.ac.uk/project/famCNV/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Family-based designs, from twin studies to isolated populations with their complex genealogical data, are a valuable resource for genetic studies of heritable molecular biomarkers.
