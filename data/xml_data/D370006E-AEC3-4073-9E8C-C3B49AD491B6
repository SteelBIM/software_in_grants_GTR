Prosperity</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M010163/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>We propose to establish a multi-disciplinary Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP). Led by the University of Surrey, CUSP will work with a range of academic and non-academic partners to establish a rich international network of collaborative research. The aim of this research will be to explore the economic, ecological, social and governance dimensions of sustainable prosperity and to make concrete recommendations to government, business and civil society in pursuit of it. 

Our guiding vision for sustainable prosperity is one in which people everywhere have the capability to flourish as human beings - within the ecological and resource constraints of a finite planet. Our work will explore not just the economic aspects of this challenge, but also its social, political and philosophical dimensions. We will address the implications of sustainable prosperity at the level of households and firms; and we will explore sector-level and macro-economic implications of different pathways to prosperity. We will pay particular attention to the pragmatic steps that need to be taken by enterprise, government and civil society in order to achieve a sustainable prosperity. 

The CUSP work programme is split into five themes (our MAPSS framework). Theme M explores the moral framing and contested meanings of prosperity itself. Taking a broadly philosophical approach we examine how people, enterprise and government negotiate the tensions between sustainability and prosperity. Theme A explores the role of the arts and of culture in our society. We will look not only at the role of the arts in communicating sustainability but at culture as a vital element in prosperity itself. Theme P addresses the politics of sustainable prosperity and explores the institutional shifts that will be needed to achieve it. We will work closely with both corporate and social enterprise to test new models of sustainability for business. Theme S1 explores the social and psychological dimensions of prosperity. We will work with households and individuals in order to understand how people negotiate their aspirations for the good life. As part of this theme we will engage with UNEP in a major study of young people's lifestyles across the world. Theme S2 examines the complex dynamics of social and economic systems on which sustainable prosperity depends. We will address in particular the challenge of achieving financial stability and high employment under conditions of constrained resource consumption. 

Alongside our MAPSS work programme, we will initiate a major international Sustainable Prosperity Dialogue (chaired by Dr Rowan Williams - former Archbishop of Canterbury and Master of Magdalene College Cambridge). We will also establish an international network of CUSP Fellows from both academic and non-academic institutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The goal of achieving a sustainable prosperity has enormous economic, social and political significance for society as a whole. The combined challenges of climate change, resource constraints and financial instability pose serious threats to businesses, to households, to the finance sector, to government and to civil society. There is an urgent need for first-class, multidisciplinary, innovative research on the wider implications of these challenges and on potential solutions to them. There is also a need to promote an open, creative dialogue on the nature of sustainable prosperity and the avenues to achieve it. In seeking to address these needs, our work will have positive benefits in numerous sectors and for numerous stakeholders. In particular: 

- Our exploration of the moral framing and meanings of prosperity will re-invigorate civil society in a vital debate about the nature of social progress.
- Our exploration of the role of culture in the co-production of prosperity will provide clear recommendations for policy to support the cultural sector and improve the quality of life.
- Our work with enterprise, developing and testing new business models, will increase the resilience, competitiveness, and sustainability of industry.
- Our work on social enterprise will increase the resilience of local communities and enhance their ability to deliver high-quality services.
- Our initiatives to strengthen and enhance the basis for ethical investment, new banking models, and improved governance will improve financial security and reduce moral hazard.
- Our research on the social and psychological dimensions of sustainable prosperity will provide crucial insights to policy-makers and enhance the democratic legitimacy of transition
- Our analysis of system dynamics will test alternative narratives for the structure of the macro-economy and increase the confidence of government in promoting economic change.
- Our engagement with international initiatives to understand the aspirations and values of young people will enhance the ability of governments to plan for the next generation.
- Our initiative to create a high-profile Sustainable Prosperity Dialogue will increase and improve the participation of civil society, business and academia in governance processes.
- Our innovative research programme on sustainable prosperity will help build capacity amongst young researchers, students and civil society organisations to address new challenges.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-01-10</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-11</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4782479</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Social Enterprise UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Wellbeing Centres as community businesses, Power to Change (Lottery funded) research project</gtr:description><gtr:id>94F5920E-8F9A-490A-A677-7E5D29F38F73</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing Research</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Leading new research project on wellbeing centres operating as community businesses in collaboration with Social Enterprise UK, funded by Power to Change, a Lottery funded programme</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Leading new research project on wellbeing centres operating as community businesses in collaboration with Social Enterprise UK, funded by Power to Change, a Lottery funded programme</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Resilience Research in Bhutan</gtr:description><gtr:id>D0248336-4D3A-489E-95C0-86F96F73C837</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>NERC funded project on enterprise resilience and sustainability when seismic risks in Bhutan.

Based on this article, there was a key area of thought which was entirely ignored by Professor Scruton, and which is particularly conspicuous in its absence, this is the feminist perspective. This is remarkable given Scruton's arguments pivot around the concept of the home and domestic spheres. In this response to Scruton's article I wish to focus specifically on Scruton's understanding of home or 'oikophilia' and the ways in which he overlooks the patriarchal norms which govern these institutions. I will argue that this oversight undermines his argument as it fails to acknowledge that these spaces are governed by doctrines and 'top-down' structures to the same degree (if not more) as the revolutionary political projects he criticises.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cusp.ac.uk/blog/commentary/mc_m1-02/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Social Innovation Research Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CC0FD10C-AAE6-4DF2-8260-F4BD38E4FC8C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference on social enterprise, innovation and design thinking for wellbeing and sustainability.

Malm's research has focused on the role that fossil fuels have played in the historical development of capitalism, as well as questions of how to move beyond the fossil economy. He is currently working on a sequel to his book, provisionally titled Fossil Empire, on how Britain employed the fuels and associated technologies of the fossil economy to 'create, subordinate and penetrate the peripheries of the nineteenth-century world economy'.

Malm's talk is part of a series of events organised by members of CUSP at Goldsmiths. It will focus on questions of time and nature, and the abstract is as follows:

Fredric Jameson has famously defined postmodernity as the disappearance of time and nature in the space of late capitalism. But as temperatures continue to soar, the legacy of two centuries of accumulated CO2 bursts into the present, in the form of, most spectacularly, extreme weather events, while the Earth system ratchets up the warming on its own accord through a host of accelerating feedback mechanisms. Have time and nature come back to haunt us? This talk will offer some thoughts on the theoretical and cultural implications of a warming world, its peculiar temporality and historicised nature. How can we make sense of the ongoing climate chaos - most recently afflicting the propertyless masses on Haiti - and, more importantly, intervene in it? What sort of analytical equipment could be of use here? Discussing some contemporary theories of the imbroglio of nature and society, this talk will sketch a historical materialist approach to the dialectics between them.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cusp.ac.uk/event/a_malm/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Finance Innovation Lab - Responding to the next finacial crisis</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>29DB1FF9-3E4B-411A-8EFC-D915C0D5CF0F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>One day seminar discussing issues related to investment and CUSP</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>SSU Climate Week CUSP seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A190349D-D739-40F4-A3E7-DC5CE98A8F59</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An 'Ecological Conversion'?

Contrary to these trends, there is an important body of work that explores the contingency and construction of 'the consumer' alongside the ways in which this shifting subject position has been mobilized in pursuit of various political and economic projects.

Taking a cue from these developments, this presentation considers the apparent vogue for tackling global problems (in sustainability, health and so on) through appeals to the responsibilities of individual consumers. While objections to these man?uvers are not difficult to find, critical perspectives on sustainable consumption and behavior change neglect fundamental questions concerning changes over time, variation across substantive domains, and the mechanisms through which individuals and consumers are assumed to be responsibilised.

By way of rejoinder, David presents the findings from an empirically grounded study of the ways in which the challenge of food waste reduction has been framed, interpreted and responded to in the UK. Particular attention is paid to the configuration of relationships between different groups of strategic and collective actors (firms, policy makers, civil society organizations), and the ways in which these are mediated by the real and discursive figure of 'the consumer'. He demonstrates that initial responses did indeed frame the issue as one fostering more responsible patterns of consumption, but that this quickly gave way to an emergent sense of distributed responsibility. Tracing the contours of this debate, David suggests that the (arguably) more satisfactory manner in which it unfolded relates to the rhetorical and tactical deployment of 'the consumer'. To conclude, he posits the possible exhaustion of the responsibilized individual as a way of theorizing the location of the consumer in relation to the politics of sustainability.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Hillary Award and 'Prosperity Without Growth: Foundations for the Economy of Tomorrow' book Launch</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1BE9C31A-AFB9-4DF7-B8AB-C01D10E28FA9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A new edition of Prosperity Without Growth was launched at a special event on 19 December at the University of Surrey, which also celebrated his appointment as 2016 Hillary Laureate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.routledge.com/Prosperity-without-Growth-Foundations-for-the-Economy-of-Tomorrow/Jackson/p/book/9781138935419</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>How Statistics Lost their power</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>18610E28-BE08-4AE3-A16D-DAF345E2FF64</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guardian Long Read: How statistics lost their power - and why we should fear what comes next | William Davies

It is facilitated by the Postgrowth Institute, and comprises around 50 like-minded organisations which amplify each other's messages through social media.
Every member group can submit up to four pieces of content per year for which they want greater exposure. The alliance office then creates a social media post for the message, geared towards maximum uptake (some of their Facebook posts have reached more than 250,000 people), and share it with the Alliance members for simple re-posting.

But recent experience offers new insights into the challenge. As part of the Annual RGS conference, Tim Jackson's talk starts from a critical examination of the conventional vision and explores the possibilities for moving beyond it. In particular, it makes the case that articulating a 'sustainable prosperity' is a precise, definable, pragmatic and meaningful task. It outlines the dimensions of a 'post-growth' economy and explores a vision for the good life defined by the possibilities of having 'more fun with less stuff'.

The follow-on panel is led by Peter Jackson (University of Sheffield), chair of this year's conference. Discussants are David Evans (University of Manchester); and Jo Little (University of Exeter.

In summary
The Happy Museum is a project set up by Tony Butler to work with the museum sector as a contributor towards enhanced wellbeing - essential they help museums to contribute to sustainable prosperity. With support from Arts Council England the Happy Museum have funded 22 museums to co-create community participation projects. Tony was delighted to hear about CUSP approach to the role of the arts and cultural industries and I certainly feel we share many common goals. I would highly recommend that we look to collaborate with the Happy Museum - perhaps through shared events around our Sustainable Prosperity Dialogue.
Presenters
- Lord Gus O'Donnell - I got a chance to talk to Gus and tell him about CUSP and he was very interested in being kept informed. Although he has more of a pro-growth perspective he did see the value in overcoming differences in semantics and realising points of commonalities in order to reach shared objectives. I thought he might be an interesting person to invite to join the CUSP Advisory Group?
- Maria Amidu - an inspiring visual artist who is interested in the social relationships between people mediated by things: objects and places. She thinks a lot about this and authenticity and then makes work in response. It would be great if we could work with her in some way, although not sure how at this stage
- Rob Hopkins - founder of the transition movement. Clearly a great speaker about the local economy, perhaps someone worth talking to for the P.2 project?
Other interesting contacts
- Isobel Wilson, Arts Council England
- Peter Gingold, Tipping Point - Organisation interested in the intersection between climate change and art, although they look at climate change in the broadest sense and do want to include concepts of wellbeing. They will be commissioning 10 new pieces later this year (perhaps I will talk to Maria about this!). They would also be interested in collaboration opportunities under the SP Dialogue.
- Ben Twist, Creative Carbon Scotland
I key message that came through for me was the situational context of wellbeing, and that as public spaced in the heart of their community, where people come to learn, have fun, socialise and sometimes seek refuge, museums can play an important role in enhancing wellbeing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://cdn.kolola.net/45_cuspimpact/photos/p_2_56dffaa0ed1dc.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ESA Consumption Research Network Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5E31F7FA-E5E7-41C7-B427-317EE37C5D65</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Kate Burningham presented paper on sustainable consumption in early motherhood at the ESA Consumption Research Network conference.

The forum brought together leaders from across government, business, finance and civil society to inspire action towards achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. It explored the vision for 2030, and shared practical examples of how different actors are adopting the Global Goals, in particular focusing on ways to measure progress. The event 
- Shared case studies demonstrating cross-sector collaboration and practical responses by businesses, governments and other actors
- Demonstrated the benefits of collaboration in providing the data sets needed to measure progress
- Identified solutions to close key data gaps and highlight opportunities for convergence across measurement frameworks
- Created a pathway to inspire action

I was able to update them on CUSP and briefly run them through the MAPSS framework. Below are a few notes from that meeting.

- Happiness Works create real time measurement tools for organisations to improve happiness in their organisation as a driver for their success
- Tools are all linked to action that can be taken to improve happiness. 
- Adam Davidson is researcher at Happiness Works - he has agreed that we can put the &amp;quot;sweet spot&amp;quot; PhD in contact with him once they have started. Adam should be able to attend both our launch events. 
- They do undertake their own research however this research is fit for their purposes, and therefore may not be directly usable in academic research. 
- Nic is really interested in internal organisational structures and the relationship to happiness (e.g. holacracy, hierarchy..) and we briefly discussed the possibility of a sweet spot of organisational structures. This is something he would be very interested in.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Economics and the Cultivation of Virtue</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B4215BC-14DA-45A9-8644-03DD0168B8FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Jeffrey D.

Seven years later, on the occasion of the launch of the revised 2nd edition of Prosperity without Growth, Tim Jackson will give a lecture at University of Canterbury. The CUSP Director will discuss how much has changed in our new political and economic reality, and ask what we mean by a 'post-growth' economy? How can we live well in a finite planet?

More than four decades after it was first published, the Club of Rome's Limits to Growth report continues to raise questions, invite misunderstandings and inspire new thinking. To mark the establishment of a new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on the Limits to Growth, Tim Jackson's talk will provide an update on the state of the debate and an analysis of its relevance today. 
 
There is unsettling evidence that society is still following the 'standard run' of the original study - in which overshoot leads to an eventual collapse of production and living standards. Detailed recent studies suggests that 'peak production' in some key resources may only be decades away. Certain other limits to growth - less visible in the 1972 report - present equally pressing challenges to modern society. The talk highlights in particular the ecological challenge of meeting the Paris Agreement on climate change and the economic challenge of a 'secular stagnation'. 
 
One of the most important lessons from the original study is that early responses are absolutely vital as limits are approached. In this context, there is clearly a premium on creating political space for dialogue and exploring alternatives to growth. Tim's talk outlines initiatives in both these directions.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/Pages/onebank/seminars/research.aspx</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Bank of England Seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B0D8DFD-00A2-4527-ADAD-E778BCF0AA78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Speech and Panel discussion by Tim Jackson at the Bank of England</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CECAN workshop on policy and complexity</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD4D8070-BEDA-4629-8ABA-89735F62642A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ran a workshop for members of ESRC/NERC programme CECAN to consider fundamental issues for research at interface of policymaking and complex systems thinking</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Spending time in a low carbon society: Less stuff, more fun?</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B5C5DCCB-4754-4660-B411-9239A79A16CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation by Angela Druckman at LSE as part of their Climate Change, Inequality and Social Policy seminar series</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Making all things comrades - CUSP blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2237EE6B-EADE-4548-9861-6F44EBAEB4F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Review of Wark's Molecular Red by Will Davies.

In various forms and in various ways, modernity puts nature and humanity in peril, by respecting no fundamental conditions or limits of either.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cusp.ac.uk/blog/commentary/wd_m1-02/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest Lecture at Dalhousie University</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08166649-5D2D-4DCC-AFFB-E9E516F5E313</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guest Lecture by Peter Victor on &amp;quot;Exploring Alternative Economic Futures&amp;quot; - video presentation</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://connect.yulearn.yorku.ca/system/get-player?urlPath=/p8f2lmfanj6/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CES Open Afternoon</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3B23BF3-BBAE-4C1B-887B-2CA5117B214C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;Limits revisited: towards an understanding of sustainable prosperity&amp;quot; Tim Jackson, Director of the ESRC Centre for the Understanding of Sustainable Prosperity (CUSP) and Professor of Sustainable Development presented an overview of the Centre's work and outline its role as secretariat to the recently established All Party Parliamentary Group on the Limits to Growth.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>CECAN Event: Policy Evaluation For A Complex World</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E1252966-72BA-4674-8AF2-40578BE7A762</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CECAN Event: Policy Evaluation For A Complex World</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Intergenerational learning - CUSP blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6BCF6DCA-B57E-49B8-BDF6-A9C314271266</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Agenda 2030 forms an ambitious set of long-run goals.

CSF seem very keen to work with CUSP on this and other projects, principally viewing CUSP as sustainability and economics experts. For this project their interest is primarily in having someone with experience of alternative business models in small businesses. However, they are also interested in future collaboration potentially involving wider economic issues around fashion as a design/craft led industry that could be an economic sweet spot and economic assessment of the potential scaling of alternative business models.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interview for Radio 5 Drive show</gtr:description><gtr:form>A broadcast e.g. TV/radio/film/podcast (other than news/press)</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA3EC92D-F773-4E93-B952-4BFD6D84B59E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Phil Catney interviewed about the by-election in Stoke Central.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>An economy that works - CUSP blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>14171014-A74C-40BD-9B65-CBA33F99A052</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prosperity isn't just about earning more and having more, it consists in our ability to participate meaningfully in the life of society.

The spread of 'socially useful' knowledge and skills about domestic energy conservation is an important part of reducing harmful greenhouse emissions and alleviating energy poverty. Cultivating conversations between users about energy conservation is hence a corollary to social learning.

This talk examines the potential of locally-based interactive knowledge sharing networks - 'Community Knowledge Networks' (CKNs) - to enhance community capacity to engage in energy conservation. Drawing upon fieldwork data, the talk will identify a number of barriers to opening-up collective conversations about energy use and conservation. The presentation explores potential methods of stimulating conversation about energy conservation to overcome such barriers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.cusp.ac.uk/news/pc_community-knowledge/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>APPG LtG meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4D68593B-F4F6-46E1-9A8E-BC69B29004D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting of the APPG on LtG to set the groups priorities and work programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (SPERI) workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A0F76D41-A1C5-4C37-B227-36DF681253DD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Designing Sustainable Economies: Translating ideas and research into policy and practice - Paper presented to workshop organised by Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute (Speri), 28-29 July 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Johannes Kaup (radio ORF/?1)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AEFEB852-93C3-4C30-952E-043BA59796C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Radio Interview with Johannes Kaup (radio ORF/&amp;Ouml;1) in conjunction with the 3rd international Conference of Growth in Transition.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://oe1.orf.at/team/johanneskaup</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Goals Conference</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>133AA69B-52E7-4FC2-B275-DBB2E5D7B29A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Acting as facilitator at Ken Stimpson Community School conference on the SDGs, working with groups of young people to understand the SDGs and how to achieve them.

Using the example of political economy, Professor Andrew Sayer will talk about social science's conflicted stances towards normativity, and how these derive from unsatisfactory treatments of culture-nature relations, and a false equation of objectivity with value-freedom. The problems have been institutionally underpinned by the fragmentation of the social sciences into separate disciplines, each pursuing its parochial yet imperialist ventures. One consequence of this has been the divorce of positive (descriptive) and normative thought, exemplified by the lack of communication between political theory and political economy or sociology.
