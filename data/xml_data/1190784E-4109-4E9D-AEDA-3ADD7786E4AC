This can be done without harming the patient in any way. These technologies allow us to monitor treatment and guide therapies to where they are most needed. The 3D imaging techniques such as X-ray CT and MRI have only been around for 30 years yet in that time they have transformed healthcare. In recent years there have been significant advances in extending imaging methods, in particular optical techniques, to investigate the function of living cells that make up the human body and the interactions between the molecules that govern the functions of these cells. The level of detail provided by these images covers 6 orders of magnitude, often in 3D. This has created a challenge to find ways to understand how to relate relevant information across this wide range of spatial scale. This is required in order to better understand the function and interactions of the body?s organs, and their constituent cells, together with the molecular interactions that control their function in health and disease. Many of these imaging technologies also provide time varying information so that dynamic processes can be observed and measured. While these ?movies? provide invaluable information on dynamic and time changing processes that are so important in understanding normal metabolic function and disease, their analysis provides particularly difficult computational and mathematical challenges. This programme will bring together some of the world?s leading physical scientists, mathematicians, life scientists and clinicians to exploit these opportunities to establish research programmes to better understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease and ultimately to devise and test new therapies that result from this better understanding.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>In life sciences and medicine many of the most exciting advances and discoveries take place at the boundary of traditional academic disciplines, in particular at the interface with the physical sciences. UCL undertakes world-class research in all three areas and in particular has one of the largest groupings of biomedical research in Europe. Imaging is key to many of the advances in biomedicine and UCL has internationally leading groups in both clinical and biomedical imaging. The overall objective of UCL?s bid to the MRC?s Interdisciplinary Bridging Award scheme is the formation of a programme that brings Physicists, Engineers, Computer Scientists and Mathematicians together with Life Scientists and Clinicians. The aim of this programme is to facilitate and coordinate the significant research opportunities that arise from applying multidimensional and time-series imaging and information processing across a wide range of spatial scales. This activity will also support ongoing interdisciplinary research into developing new MR, optical and ultrasound imaging technologies and the chemistry required to develop new contrast agents and tracers of biological function. This will accelerate our understanding of the basics of life and the biological processes that underlie major health problems such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and cardiovascular diseases. The multidisciplinary activity will accelerate the translation of these discoveries to novel therapies and diagnostics in the clinic. 

The bridging activities will consist of a seminar programme, one-day workshops and weekly joint seminars of the groups involved. We will establish and maintain a database of research in biomedical imaging. We will fund visits by 5 internationally renowned scientists in areas of relevance to our discipline bridging activity. Another key feature of our proposal is creation of a fund of #130,000 that will be used to facilitate and pump prime research activity between the groups that form the programme.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2009-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>326254</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCL Institute of Neurology</gtr:department><gtr:description>UCL Imaging Technology Platform</gtr:description><gtr:id>DAA5DDEC-BB26-47E3-9178-1A3CD2E5678A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This initiative has been primarily about setting up collaborations.
