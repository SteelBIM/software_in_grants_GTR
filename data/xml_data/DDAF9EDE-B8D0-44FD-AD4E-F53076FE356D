Century</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J010375/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This proposal stems directly from the EPSRC Workshop held on 20 &amp;amp; 21 October 2010 &amp;quot;ICT Research - The Next Decade&amp;quot;. It seeks to address the challenge of the navigation of time-based media collections and items throughout the content life-cycle, from creation to consumption. It will achieve this by establishing an open network of researchers from across academia and industry, who engage in workshops, sandpits and, most importantly, feasibility or path-finder mini-projects. These mini-projects have the aims not only of performing leading edge, early stage research that will lead on to larger proposals, but also of building a critical mass of researchers, whose expectation is to tackle significant challenges by collaborating. Other elements of this project are to create a Landscape document for the field, develop appropriate ontologies for capturing media semantics, present results through a diverse range of channels and summarise the findings of the project, including a Roadmap.
 
The research agenda is based on five premises: 
1. Content-related metadata is an effective and scalable approach exemplified in this domain and applicable to future large scale, automated and interactive information systems;
2. The point of creation is the best time and place to collect (and compute) metadata; 
3. The best way to represent this metadata is one that is amenable to knowledge processing and management, linked data strategies and logical inference;
4. Significant challenges require a cross-disciplinary approach, ranging from fundamental theory to applied research set in the context of a real problem; and 
5. The UK is supremely placed with the world-leading skills and experience to be a world-beating authority in an area of intellectual and societal/commercial benefit.

This proposal deliberately does not address related problems of navigation through legacy content, nor of Rights Management, as these are already embedded in the research landscape. Instead, we concentrate on the production of future media items.

The issues raised and investigated by this proposal are pertinent not only to EPSRC, but also to ESRC, AHRC, JISC and TSB, and with particular relevance to the Digital Economy.

The applications of such ideas span all the different time-based media, including music, drama, documentary, film, texts and so on. In order to advance the field, this project will bring together acknowledged experts from across UK academia in a diverse range of disciplines, including Semantic Web experts, Signal Processing experts, Video experts, Performance experts and more. The project aims to form a network and a critical mass of expertise by a series of interventions that will also include industrial collaborators (assisted by the TSB Creative Industries Knowledge Transfer Network). Network activities include workshops and sandpits, as well as collaborative small scale research projects, each typically of 6 months duration with 2 or 3 participant universities.

The outcomes of the project include: Research and Impact Roadmaps; a well-connected community of researchers engineers, creatives, content producers and funders; commercial and full-fledged research proposals; research publications; and specific impact activities at world leading Broadcast and Media conventions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The context of this proposal is development of EPSRC ICT strategy, following the ICT Futures Workshop. Therefore this is an important pathway to impact. In addition, by conducting this strategy study in the context of the creative industries domain it will have impact in a field where application of ICT has direct and large scale societal relevance.

The primary beneficiaries of this strategy study are ICT researchers (including but not exclusively academic), and by embedding in the context of digital media it also benefits those involved in the creation, production and ultimately consumption of digital content. We believe that the best way to create a research agenda which ultimately leads to the successful application of advanced ICT research is to engage in a domain that exemplifies future ICT challenges, adopts leading edge technology, has massive user engagement, is an incubator for new ideas and new business models, and has existing engagement activities to build on. 

By conducting this ICT strategy study in the context of digital media the project will address the following impact areas: Quality of Life; Knowledge Transfer/Exchange; Business and Commercial; Policy; Communications and Engagement.

The Roadmaps are the principal deliverable and will made widely available and promoted through community channels both within ICT and Creative Industries. The other mechanisms to ensure impact are summarised below.
* Research projects: Collaborative mini-projects involving at least 2 universities and preferably at least one company
* Workshops: Four with target number of participants: 100
* Sandpits: Four with target number of participants: 30
* Conferences: Individual Research Projects report results to conferences, for example ACM Multimedia
* Trade Show: Stand at International Broadcast Convention (IBC) 2013/4
* Fact-finding Missions: Travel to research centres such as Fraunhofer Institutes in Germany, MediaX at Stanford, Media Lab at MIT, Interactive Telecommunication Program (ITP) at NYU.
* Standardization: the project will be represented at all MPEG meetings (4 per year) over its duration. The communication will be 2-way. The project will also engage with EBU and W3C
* Electronic Forums: the project will create a live website, and a social networking forum (probably over LinkedIn)

Long term, the outcomes of this project will have significant impact on how entertainment content is created, delivered, modified and consumed. The opportunity is for the UK to take a lead in this highly important generator of National Income. Those working in the entertainment content industries will be impacted by improved workflow, productivity and satisfaction in the workplace. Those consuming the content will find the entertainment needs satisfied more easily and more completely.

Finally, there will be direct impact on the RA employed on the project by exposure to the wide range of industry needs and the scientific and technological challenges and solutions that will be addressed. Similarly those employed to work on the Feasibility Study mini-projects will benefit similarly.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-04-16</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>572749</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Arup Group</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mini-Project: A 'second screen' music discovery and recommendation service based on social-cultural factors</gtr:description><gtr:id>2BD2B01D-0CD6-4293-9EC1-FEB7F56713B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Open source software</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Viewers watching TV may would like to use their tablet or smart phone as a 'second screen', firstly to identify any music playing on the TV, and then secondly to discover more information about it.

We propose to investigate born-semantic music, where semantic annotation can
be added at any point in the production of the music. For this, we will
combine Overtone and Tawny-OWL. The former is an electronic music system that
allows the description and synthesis of music at all levels: from the quality
of the sounds, to notes and rhythm, to song or composition level. The latter
allows a generation of semantic annotation in OWL. Crucially, these use the
same underlying syntax and language. This should allow annotations at any
level to percolate; so, for example, if a musician creates a drum sound, their
role as a contributor should percolate through to any piece of music using
that sound automatically. Likewise, richer annotation such as mood, pace,
style should percolate.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This was a mini-project funded by the Semantic Media grant:

The project will produce an online demonstrator to show the principles in action, serving as a multidisciplinary pilot application of Linked Data in the study of early music which will be widely applicable for scholarship in other musical and historical repertories.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Birmingham City University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mini-Project: Large-Scale capture of Producer-Defined Musical Semantics</gtr:description><gtr:id>0AE92530-7E30-4767-9FED-5AD749B2DA35</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference publications, open source software</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The study is motivated by the lack of transferable semantic descriptors in music production and the requirement for more intuitive control of low-level parameters, thus providing musicians with easier access to technology.

We can use natural language processing tools to analysis the transcripts, extract important concepts (semantic annotations) from statements they have made and categorize them by the key concepts, such as law, economy, foreign affairs, NHS, migration, etc. Furthermore, using linked data, each important statement and semantic concepts in the programme will be linked to a fragment of the video archive.

The outcome of the mini-project will be the identification of an appropriate methodology for the capture of this semantic data.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Southampton</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mini-Project: SemanticNews: enriching publishing of news stories</gtr:description><gtr:id>143DC02F-5B2B-4714-B8BF-C4E0A3E6F6BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Technical reports, conference publications.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This project aims to promote people's comprehension and assimilation of news by augmenting live broadcast news articles with information from the SW in the form of linked open data (LOD).

We propose to investigate born-semantic music, where semantic annotation can
be added at any point in the production of the music. For this, we will
combine Overtone and Tawny-OWL. The former is an electronic music system that
allows the description and synthesis of music at all levels: from the quality
of the sounds, to notes and rhythm, to song or composition level. The latter
allows a generation of semantic annotation in OWL. Crucially, these use the
same underlying syntax and language. This should allow annotations at any
level to percolate; so, for example, if a musician creates a drum sound, their
role as a contributor should percolate through to any piece of music using
that sound automatically. Likewise, richer annotation such as mood, pace,
style should percolate.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This was a mini-project funded by the Semantic Media grant:

Fusing these resources will facilitate innovative, to date unprecedented ways of navigating through the popular music space, enabling novel research to be carried out. The integration of resources and the provision of an easy to use interface present several challenges requiring disparate skills, interdisciplinary collaboration, and small scale funding difficult to obtain otherwise. These challenges include the effective fusion of Semantic Web resources with data and analytical tools provided by ACO, metadata alignment in different data repositories, testing and improving large-&amp;shy;-scale data integration technologies, and providing an interface relevant to researchers and students working in popular musicology. The project will thus rely on, and bring value to multiple disciplines including musicology, Linked Data and the Semantic Web, user interface design, software development, and the broader fields of music informatics and pedagogy.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Semantic Media @ BBC</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>972D2C26-2F8B-4035-ABCB-D65C640D3D15</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organized a workshop in conjunction with the BBC to foster relationships and promote the idea of using semantic technologies in media-related fields and combine that with signal processing and machine learning.

A major goal of the Semantic Media project is to establish an open network uniting industrial and academic research efforts related to the development of novel tools and standards for organizing and navigating in digital media. To this end, the project meetings bring industrialists together with theoretical and applied researchers, to foster relationships, and encourage working together to find solutions to science and technology problems that are relevant to digital media; see our website for a list of initial project partners (http://semanticmedia.org.uk).

Goals for the 'Semantic Media @ BBC' workshop include:

 To demonstrate the work of BBC R&amp;amp;D in areas relevant for the Semantic Media project, and to identify tasks on which the BBC could collaborate with academic researchers
 To present datasets that the BBC has to offer to external researchers.
 To involve the BBC production and archive departments to
 to illustrate how the production and archival process works within a large scale media corporation
 to gather ideas for new annotation and metadata technology to be developed within Semantic Media projects (or in full-scale follow-up projects)
 to identify how people involved in the archival and production process could actually benefit from new technology and how novel computational methods could be integrated into existing workflows in such a way that they would be accepted as new and useful tools.

Since academic research typically does not include the production of media seeing the &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; is essential for the project and hence it is important to integrate production and archive experts as early as possible.

The Semantic Media project aims at establishing an open network uniting research efforts related to the development of novel tools and standards for organizing and navigating in digital media archives. In this context, the British Library as one of the two largest libraries in the world is of particular importance. The collection comprises more than 150 million items from many countries and in many formats (digital and print): books, newspapers, magazines, journals, and manuscripts, as well as sound and music recordings, videos, patents, databases, maps, stamps, drawings and much more. Providing access to these collections the British Library has served researchers for many years. However, with the corresponding data sets expanding exponentially over time, there is an increasing demand for new approaches to making use of these gigantic collections.
Overview

1.) British Library Collections: British Library curators will give some insight into their collections (image, audio, video, news,...), which might spark some new (research) ideas in terms of how libraries could collaborate with universities to make collections more accessible. In particular, we want to start a discussion of what technology is actually needed from a library point of view.

2.) Networking: There will be a networking session, where we try to introduce people to each other across a range of media-related disciplines (image/video/audio/music/text/multimedia/linked data). The idea is to spark ideas for interdisciplinary research and build the foundations for future collaborative grant applications.

3.) Funding: Two funding schemes will be discussed: &amp;quot;BL-Labs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Semantic Media&amp;quot;. Both aim at providing funding for small projects, to develop new ideas in the context of digital media collections.

Thus, the microphone of the 'second screen' device is used to listen to the music playing on the TV, whilst audio fingerprinting technology is used to identify it. Then, a dynamically webpage is generated providing rich information about the music identified, as well as related music and musical artists based on social-cultural factors. The latter is achieved by querying web services such as Youtube, The Echonest, Last.fm and MusicBrainz. Linking and making sense - knowledge inference - out of such wide range and diverse music-related data acquired across multiple sources and services on the web is achieved thanks to C4DM Music Ontology. An Android app acting as a 'second screen' is currently available for demonstration purposes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>9757420F-E88F-49CE-9B17-ADC553578DBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The corresponding demo has been discussed within the MPEG consortium.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Demo Second Screen</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/screen2</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Outcome of mini-project 'Large-Scale capture of Producer-Defined Musical Semantics.' led by Ryan Stables.

The study is motivated by the lack of transferable semantic descriptors in music production and the requirement for more intuitive control of low-level parameters, thus providing musicians with easier access to technology. We aim to overcome this problem by evaluating large amounts of labelled data taken from within the digital audio workstation. The main novelty that will be introduced by the project is a model for the estimation of perceptually accurate descriptors based on a large corpus of semantically annotated music production data. The outcome of the mini-project will be the identification of an appropriate methodology for the capture of this semantic data.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A6113D7-C514-4653-BD6E-1222BF67B73D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A conference paper listed separately and ongoing work as part of the EPSRC programme grant FAST-IMPACT.</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Demo SAFE Plugins</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/semanticaudio/SAFE</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AF90E54A-9DBD-429C-ABCD-9413EBC48252"><gtr:id>AF90E54A-9DBD-429C-ABCD-9413EBC48252</gtr:id><gtr:title>Semi-automated video logging by incremental and transfer learning</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/777f83df34e1859c83cdf51578caf9d5"><gtr:id>777f83df34e1859c83cdf51578caf9d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kim J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DBCD4BA0-4552-4C95-807E-D16D35FB6CA5"><gtr:id>DBCD4BA0-4552-4C95-807E-D16D35FB6CA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Robust Joint Alignment of Multiple Versions of a Piece of Music</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/57fcb015a363298d25f9ca1ab6f9fb5f"><gtr:id>57fcb015a363298d25f9ca1ab6f9fb5f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Wang, S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/83995F45-CA51-4E9D-9502-70C3990F7753"><gtr:id>83995F45-CA51-4E9D-9502-70C3990F7753</gtr:id><gtr:title>Hello cleveland!
