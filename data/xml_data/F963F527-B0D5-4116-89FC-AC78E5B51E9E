Although the present medicines can attenuate the symptoms to some extent, the expected outcome is still poor. Therefore a new treatment is needed as soon as possible. Since heart failure is caused by the loss or poor functioning of heart muscle cells, destroyed or damaged during a heart attack, regeneration therapy seems promising by the replenishment of the damaged heart muscle with new heart muscle cells or heart muscle stem cells (cardiac progenitor cells; CPCs) created in the laboratory. However our current knowledge is too limited to be able to create sufficiently safe and effective cells for clinical use. Thus a much better understanding of CPCs is critical to bring such regeneration therapy into the clinical arena.

It is known that CPCs are composed of two different populations known as the first and the second heart field. The first and the second heart fields are the origin of left side and the right side of the heart, respectively. A factor called Tbx5 is present in the first heart field and another two factors called Nkx2-5 and Isl1 are present in both the first and the second heart fields. CPCs positive for Nkx2-5 or Isl1 are known to give rise to heart muscle cells as well as other components of the heart. On the other hand, although CPCs positive for Tbx5, the first heart field, are known to produce heart muscle cells, whether the first heart field can also produce other cell types present in the heart is still largely unknown.

To better understand CPCs, we have been studying CPCs from the earliest stage during embryogenesis with a state-of-art technique, single cell cDNA analysis. This technique allows us to study each a single CPC one by one, which brings detailed information with a resolution that other methods have never been able to provide. According to our data, we found the novel evidence that the first heart field CPCs are initially positive only for Tbx5, then become triple positive for Nkx2-5, Tbx5 and Isl1, and subsequently become double positive for Nkx2-5 and Tbx5. To confirm conclusively this sequential change of the first heart field CPCs according to the temporal order, we initially tried to trace Tbx5-expressing CPCs in the mouse embryonic heart by deliberately labeling Tbx5-expressing CPCs permanently with a fluorescent protein, eYFP. From this pilot study, we assume that the first heart field of Tbx5-expressing CPCs produces only heart muscle cells, which is quite different from Nkx2-5-expressing or Isl1-expressing CPCs.

In this project, we will confirm whether our original assumption that Tbx5-expressing CPCs produce only heart muscle cells is true or not. We will trace Tbx5-expressing CPCs in detail with permanent eYFP label. This will enable us to consolidate the evidence of the sequential change of Tbx5-expressing CPCs as well as to clearly identify what type of the cells Tbx5-expressing CPCs give rise to. Furthermore, we aim to establish a new method to study Tbx5-expressing cardiac progenitor cells derived from mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this new method, we can further study Tbx5-expressing CPCs in vitro without using of animals, and we can test the use of Tbx5-expressing CPCs for the treatment of animal models of heart failure by the efficient enrichment of Tbx5-expressing CPCs. Thus, successful completion of this project will clearly demonstrate whether Tbx5-expressing CPCs can only provide heart muscle cells. Such novel knowledge in basic science as well as the establishment of a useful new tool for basic science study will greatly improve our understanding of heart muscle development. We strongly believe that completion of this project is one of the many steps towards the overall goal of the establishment of future regeneration therapies for heart failure.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project aims to study the fate and the character of Tbx5-expressing cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs). The results obtained will enable a full re-assessment of the subpopulations of CPCs and will facilitate in vitro time-lapse observation of Tbx5-expressing CPCs and the harvesting of pure Tbx5-expressing CPCs in the future.
In this project, we will use two different genetically modified animals. BAC Tbx5-CreERT2 transgene is the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing 210 kb of the Tbx5 gene genome locus. CreERT2 is transcribed from this transgene in the region where Tbx5 should be expressed. The combination of this BAC Tbx5-CreERT2 transgenic mice and ROSA26-eYFP Cre reporter mice allows us to genetically label embryonic Tbx5-expressing CPCs with eYFP only when tamoxifen is administered to the pregnant females.

To trace the initial Tbx5-expressing CPCs in the BAC Tbx5-CreERT2/ROSA26-eYFP embryos, we will use whole embryo culture. This model enables tighter labeling of Tbx5-expressing CPCs strictly due to easier control of TAM concentration 

To identify which type of cells are derived from Tbx5-expressing CPCs, we will perform immunofluorescence on histological sections or RT-PCR for the cells derived from embryonic cell culture or ES cell culture to detect the marker genes' expression specific for the cell type.
To trace a clone of Tbx5-expressing CPCs in vitro, the cells labeled with eYFP will be isolated by Becton Dickinson Aria II Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting after the embryo or embryoid body is dissociated with trypsin. Individual cells will be seeded and cultured on a feeder layer in differentiation medium.
To establish a novel experimental system to trace Tbx5-expressing CPCs in vitro without using animals, we will derive ES cells from BAC Tbx5-CreERT2/ROSA26-eYFP mouse blastcysts. Derivation is carried on by culture of blastcysts on feeder cells and iSTEM (Stem Cell Sciences) medium.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project is a part of a larger programme of research to understand the biological nature of the cells which form the heart tissue, the cardiac progenitor cells or CPCs, during embryogenesis. Specifically, in this project we will aim to understand the fate and the character of Tbx5-expressing CPCs, whose biological nature remains largely unknown. The results obtained will add to the field of developmental biology and specifically help us further understand how the heart develops.

Heart failure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Treatment for the end stage is limited and its prognosis is still poor. Thus novel, better treatments are needed. Developmental biologists/stem cell scientists are intensely interested in the biology of CPCs, because mimicking the same molecular biological events in pluripotent stem cells could produce cardiomyocytes in the laboratory efficiently which could then be used to replenish the cells in the damaged heart. However, our knowledge is still too limited to produce sufficient numbers of safe and pure cells for such transplantation. Thus better understanding normal embryonic CPCs is vital. This project is therefore timely and one of the current hot topics. Successful completion of this project will push boundaries of cutting-edge science and contribute to the reputation of UK's science community. We strongly believe that the knowledge gained in this project is a one of the many steps toward the ultimate goal of regenerative therapy of the failing heart, which will be so beneficial to human health care.

It is anticipated that the main and direct beneficiary from this research will be the applicant's immediate professional circle, that is, developmental biologists and stem cell scientists both nationally and internationally. Given that this project will reveal novel aspects of a particular sub-population of CPCs, those expressing the factor, Tbx5, the results of this project will provide us with a basis to understand the biological nature of CPCs much further. After publication in scientific journals or presentation at scientific conferences/meetings, any interested researcher can use the results from this project for their own research. Additionally, this project will bring us a novel experimental tool to visualize Tbx5-expressing CPCs, which are likely to only develop (termed unipotent) into cardiomyocytes, in vitro. Thus this novel system will lead us to a further extension of this study, to treat heart failure with Tbx5-expressing CPCs in models of heart failure. This extension of the study could easily provide a great chance to produce patentable intellectual property surrounding Tbx5-expressing CPCs, which might attract investment from industry. Through this project, the post-doctoral scientist engaged directly and his/her colleagues in our research team will receive the highest standard of training in basic research, presentation and communication skills which will enable them to become leading scientists in their own right.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>321742</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Osaka University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Japan</gtr:country><gtr:department>Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences</gtr:department><gtr:description>One-step gene targeting with injecting CRISPR/Cas9 RNAs into zygotes with electroporation.</gtr:description><gtr:id>725B3F7B-A077-4EDB-9CA0-140FFA077856</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The heart defects were observed in the mutant mice of gene of interest.

simple and feasible for many laboratories, and thus far, the yield of cardiac cells from pluripotent stem cells looks stable, which reduces our redundant efforts and to save our time and
