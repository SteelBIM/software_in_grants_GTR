The case of child protection in Northern Ireland</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008017/2</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This interdisciplinary collaboration, the first of its kind, is made possible through a shared conception of improvisation between lawyer and law lecturer, Dr Sara Ramshaw, and sound artist, improviser and lecturer, Dr Paul Stapleton. Many myths currently exist in society regarding the nature of improvisation. This project seeks to debunk its conceptualisation as purely spontaneous and unplanned, or simply about individual self-expression. Improvisation is not, in other words, unfettered freedom, but is instead made up of several structural elements, such as harmony, melody, rhythm and time. Moreover, accounts regarding the individualistic nature of improvisation fail to account for the ways in which improvisation is about 'community building'. In the words of Fischlin and Heble, improvisation is 'about fostering new ways of thinking about, and participating in, human relationships' (Fischlin and Heble 2005: 23). 

Although improvisation is most often associated with the musical realm - for example, jazz music - critical improvisational research is currently being pursued across a range of arts and humanities disciplines, such as anthropology, philosophy, cultural studies and law, demonstrating the need to consider improvisation not simply as a musical form, but as a complex 'social practice', one that mediates transcultural exchanges and produces new conceptions of identity, community and justice. 

The global significance of critical improvisational research is evidenced by the Improvisation, Community and Social Practice (ICASP) project, of which the PI is a former Postdoctoral Fellow and current Research Associate. ICASP is a seven-year, $4-million international community/university research scheme, funded through the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada's (SSHRC) Major Collaborative Research Initiatives (MCRI) programme. Bringing together an international research team from eighteen universities, including McGill University, University of Cambridge, Columbia University and Harvard University, amongst others, ICASP explores musical improvisation as a model for social change and plays a leading role in defining a new field of interdisciplinary research to shape political, cultural, and ethical dialogue and action. This project will build on these insights, along with the established links the PI has with ICASP, while also developing further international associations and collaborations. 

One of the key tenets of critical improvisational studies is the emancipatory potential of improvisation. Self-consciously engaging with tradition and precedent, improvisation enables resistance to past oppression and injustice and opens up possibilities for new ways of being together in society, both locally and at the global level. 

This project begins with the premise that it is possible to transpose improvisational 'language', that is, its discourses, techniques and pedagogies, from the musical to the legal realm. However, what remains unclear is where this language may be welcomed or resisted by legal actors and institutions. Focusing on child protection law, as an area that has recently been criticised for being too formalised and overly-bureaucratic (see, for example, the Munro Review), the investigators seek to determine whether, by educating legal decision-makers about the structures of improvisation, they might themselves become better improvisers (through their participation in improvisation workshops and cross-disciplinary conversations with improvising musicians), thereby leading to more creative and courageous legal decision-making in child protection cases. 

The impact of honing the improvisational skills of legal professionals is potentially groundbreaking, influencing not only how decisions are made in child protection cases, but also the content of judicial training and legal education, thereby ultimately impacting all areas of legal decision-making.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>One of the key aims of this project is to make more understandable the 'language', that is, the discourses, techniques and pedagogies, of improvisational practices to those working in the area of child protection. Read together, recent reports on the child protection system in England and Wales, such as the Family Justice Review (2011) and the Munro Review of Child Protection (2011), call for a child protection system that listens deeply to the voices of abused children and their families, responds quickly and decisively to important issues, and adapts when necessary to problems that arise. This project aims to demonstrate the importance of improvisational principles in this regard and thus to impact the very process by which child protection decisions are made in Northern IreIand (NI) and beyond.

Through interviews and focus groups with local musicians and professionals working in the area of child protection law in NI, such as social workers, lawyers, judges, government policy makers and community activists, we hope to identify the scope for improvisation in child protection law in this jurisdiction, where it might be welcomed or resisted, and to encourage transparency in legal decision-making. The improvisation workshops with local improvising musicians furthermore aim to educate child protection professionals about the complex structures of improvisation and help them to understand the benefits of improvisational practices in legal decision-making. The impact of this project is, at least initially, primarily educational in nature. However, it is hoped that, from this empirical research and the improvisation workshops, the very process by which decisions are made in NI child protection cases will be impacted. Moreover, the techniques taught in the improvisation workshops, as a practical means of introducing and experiencing improvisation, can then be integrated into local law school and legal practice curriculum, as well as judicial training and education. Thus, while focused on local child protection law, the project has the potential to impact legal decision-making and education more generally and at the global level.

One example of how this project may impact legal decision-making more broadly is the skill it teaches of 'deep listening' - to persons, the environment and the sounds of daily life, both inside and outside the courtroom. 'Deep listening' is an improvisatory practice developed by Pauline Oliveros, which involves an ethical commitment and responsibility to, and interaction with, all that surrounds us. Deep listening in the arena of child protection will significantly impact legal decision-making and thus all those involved, from the abused child him or herself to those tasked with making law and policy in this area, such as judges and government officials. A knowledge of such improvisational techniques forces professionals to 'stay present', that is, remain in the moment and focus on the decisions at hand. It also teaches them to be aware of others and their surroundings and to take risks, trusting themselves that they know the right answers, but also understanding that such decision-making requires extensive knowledge and skill, and much practice to get it right.

The impact of critical improvisational research more generally beyond the academic community is far reaching, especially in relation to equality and diversity issues. According to Fischlin and Heble, improvisation, as a form of creative decision-making, risk-taking, and collaboration, emerged out of marginalised cultures, particularly indigenous and African slave populations, helping aggrieved peoples adapt and respond to instances of discrimination and oppressive social contexts. Improvisation, in other words, utilises 'the materials at hand to create powerful and enduring resources for hope', often out of seemingly hopeless situations .... ... find[ing] &amp;quot;a way out of no way&amp;quot;' (Fischlin and Heble 2005: 12).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-09</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>164536</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Into the Key of Law: Transposing Musical Improvisation Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>165B890D-5839-410B-AD40-781C7FC1A659</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop brought together approximately 15 academics, musicians and postgraduate students to discuss the possibility of translating improvisational practices into the discipline of law.

(1) Significant new knowledge generated in the discipline of Northern Irish child protection law: Our research documents interviews, focus groups and improvisation workshops with Northern Irish family law judges, barristers, solicitors, social workers and community workers about the role that improvisation plays in their working practices. These discussions provide clear evidence that improvisation is much more than 'making it up as you go along.' Rather, effective improvisation is shown to be a highly skilled social practice that is learned through shared experience and refined through open and attentive listening to the uniqueness of each new case or performance. Our research generated significant new knowledge in this field through a detailed analysis of the following: (a) existing challenges and opportunities in relation to child protection in NI, including issues of resources, delay, risk, and power dynamics; (b) improvisation in practice, including the topics of judicial and legal decision-making, discretion, intuition, anticipation, listening, empathy, adaptability and responsibility; and (c) possible ways forward, including prioritising experiential over textbook learning, recognising expertise as skilful adaptability, adopting constraints that are case-sensitive rather than bureaucratically imposed, and the potential of collaborative opportunities. 

(2) Significant new knowledge generated in discipline of music: Our research documents interviews, focus groups and improvisation workshops with professional improvising musicians, both local, national and international. This research generates significant new knowledge in this field, both as outlined above in (a) - (c) and also as a way of challenging the current widespread adoption of risk-adverse bureaucracy which has largely failed to deal with the complexities of modern society. In many areas, this is resulting in the de-professionalisation of skilled workers through an over-reliance on generic targets and procedures. Therefore, one of our objectives, which we believe was met, was to champion the ability of experienced practitioners, both in the legal and musical fields, to skillfully adapt to future events that cannot always be predicted with a sufficient level of certainty, or for which a single correct response does not exist. These findings are documented in the forthcoming Special Issue (guest edited by Ramshaw and Stapleton) of the Critical Studies in Improvisation journal (see publications section).

(3) Hydra: A creative training tool for legal advocacy and ethics: Hydra is a moot court-style improvisational training tool developed by our research team for instructing legal advocates on how to be nimble-footed and better able to respond quickly and responsively to unexpected situations in the courtroom. We are in the process of piloting this training tool in law schools and bar associations across the UK, and eventually in other jurisdictions, such as the USA, Canada and Australia

(4) Noteworthy new networks created through engagement activities: Our research both strengthened and created new networks for research dissemination, including: the International Institute for Critical Studies in Improvisation, the Association for the Study of Law, Culture and the Humanities, the Social Research Association, as well as local research networks, such as the Irish Feminist Judgments Project and the Translating Improvisation Research Group.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We envisage our research findings being taken forward as follows:

(1) Dissemination of both academic and non-academic publications: as noted above and in the publications section, this research project has generated several academic and non-academic publications, all of which can be openly accessed by academics, professional practitioners (legal, musical or otherwise), and the general public. It is envisioned that this research will be taken forward by these stakeholders in their development of improvisation as social practice in a variety of fields.

(2) Further piloting of Hydra: plans are in place to pilot Hydra at Exeter Law School and members of the research team have presented this training tool at a variety of institutions including: the Northern Irish Bar Association, Kent Law School, Keele Law School, Osgoode Hall Law School (Toronto, Canada), University of Victoria Law School (BC, Canada), Guelph University (Canada), and Georgetown University Law Centre (Washington, DC). Future presentations include: McGill Law School (Montreal, Canada) and, potentially, Melbourne Law School (Australia). It is hoped that key educational stakeholders will either participate in or set up their own pilots in the future.

(3) Continued dissemination through conference papers and invited talks: the research will continue to be disseminated through academic conference papers and invited talks, which, depending on the composition of the audience, may reach members of education, community and creative economy who will take forward the research in a variety of creative and educational manners.

(4) Development of judicial listening workshops: in our submission to the Northern Irish Civil and Family Justice Review, we proposed the need for further judicial training on attentive and empathetic listening skills and offered our expertise to devise a judicial training workshop that does the following: (a) encourages individual reflection on current practices of listening; and (b) highlights key skills that judges may actively seek to develop and employ to listen more effectively in both family and civil law cases. From these workshops, a training resource will be designed, which can be utilised afterwards with other judges and legal professionals, both within and outside Northern Ireland, on a national and perhaps even an international level. These training workshops on improving judicial listening skills align with the Review's goal of creating a more responsive civil and family justice system and its recommendation for further mandatory judicial training. We hope the Review Group takes us up on our offer and goes forward to implement these workshops and training resource.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7108465E-7BA3-4F97-AA2F-F1CF99F71F91</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Traditional moot court training in law schools around the world is often criticised for failing to adequately prepare legal advocates (lawyers, barristers) to be nimble-footed in the courtroom and able to respond quickly and responsively to unexpected situations. In contrast, Hydra, named after the serpent-like water monster with numerous heads in Greek mythology, hones legal argumentation skills, requiring participants to be Hydra-headed and skilled at rapidly analysing a legal issue from a variety of angles and perspectives, teaching advocates to be prepared for the unexpected.

It is through our creation of Hydra that we hope to directly impact the manner in which law students, members of the legal profession, and the general public, view improvisational practices, combatting the common myth that improvisation is simply &amp;quot;making it up as you go along&amp;quot;, an entirely spontaneous activity that is not constrained by trained expertise, cultural history or social norms. Rather improvisation is better understood as the ability to draw on prior knowledge and expertise in response to dynamically unfolding situations, which frequently require deviations from normative behaviours. Improvisation conceived as such is not simply an intuitive art form, but a socially engaged ethical practice that directly impacts on our ability to make creative decisions, engage in critical dialogue, take risks that allow for the discovery of new knowledge and new social relationships, and engage in collaborations across diverse domains and levels of expertise. 

Applied to legal advocacy, the improvisational practices taught and honed through Hydra assist law students (as future barristers and solicitors) in identifying the most fundamental tools required for skilled advocacy and learning them so exquisitely well that it is possible to pull together excellent argumentation and reasoning extemporarily. In essence, it is about a process through which students can safely hone their adversarial agility and attentive listening skills, the latter being especially necessary for professional responsibility and ethics.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0793CD5B-76F8-4870-A42D-AE7C2CDD4B19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Requests for further information and participation in
