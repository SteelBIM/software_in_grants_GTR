Based on the research, Wai Yin is hoping to develop a system of deploying the skills of older Chinese migrants to serve the local Chinese population through caring and handyman services. The system we are developing is based on the concept of &amp;quot;Furrei Kippu&amp;quot; or reciprocity whereby older service providers receive credit for helping others which they can then redeem when they need help.

Capabilities Approach and Retirement: As part of the research, we conducted a survey of 1600 older workers in the UK and Hong Kong to explore how employer interventions in relation to work, retirement and choices has on quality of life and retirement. The survey has been used by ourselves and a cluster of other researchers. We have found that there is a strong relationship between work choices and positive quality of life. People who report positive work environments in three spheres: working hour flexibility, work content and healthy work environments also report more positive life outcomes. Work choices, in turn, are the result of supportive work environments and having good skills (employability, work specific, and social skill). These results are controlled for income, gender and qualifications. From a practical perspective, the results indicate that employers which provide age positive workplaces will benefit in terms of more motivated and happier workers.

International comparison: The second research objective was to explore the extent of comparability between the UK and Hong Kong in terms of public and employer policies and practices and in so doing to explore the scope for East/West comparability. We found that there are similar drivers for employers to improve age management practices: skills shortages, knowledge management and improving performance. Further, public policies in both contexts are leading toward a privatisation of retirement planning, particularly in relation to savings and pensions. 

Finally, as an added research outcome, we conducted a case study with the NGO Wai Yin in which we found that older Chinese migrants are facing significant barriers to work due to the intersectionality of age, race and migration status. The research found that community activism can help older migrants find and maintain work which they value.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>860556DF-198A-40DD-ABCD-132FA1615844</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The report had two sets of objectives:
