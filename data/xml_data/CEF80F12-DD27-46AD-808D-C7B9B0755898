Yet there is surprisingly little evidence on the causal impact of this intervention.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will provide the most comprehensive causal analysis of the effects of free childcare provision on maternal employment and child development using UK data.&amp;nbsp; The project team will look at different instances of variation in the availability of free childcare for pre-school children in England. In particular, they will study:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>the provision of free part-time childcare to the most disadvantaged children which characterised the UK policies of the 1990s&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the provision of universal entitlement to free part-time childcare introduced in the early 2000s&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>date-of-birth discontinuities in entitlement to part-time pre-school care and full-time school education. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project will consider a wide range of outcomes including maternal employment, hours of work, working patterns, search behaviour and participation in further education, and - for the child - measures of educational attainment at various ages and socio-emotional development. Results will relate to different time-periods, policy settings and groups of families and therefore will inform on the effectiveness of various policy parameters.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We anticipate this project will have a considerable impact outside the research community. Potential beneficiaries include:

Civil servants, politicians and other policy-makers. Our research will directly evaluate the impact of free childcare/early education in England on parental employment and children's outcomes and will thereby provide valuable information that enables policy makers to review and improve their current policies and strategies. Our findings will be of direct relevance to - and inform policy decisions of - officials in the Department for Education and local authorities who are responsible for early years policy, as well as to officials in departments such as Department for Work and Pensions (which is interested in the ability of childcare to enable parents to work), the Child Poverty Unit and the Cabinet Office (which are interested in the scope for early intervention to increase social mobility), and HM Treasury, as well as to the equivalents of these departments in the governments of the devolved nations.

Practitioners and non-governmental organisations. Our project will benefit think-tanks and non-governmental organisations with an interest in childcare policy, early education or parental employment. As well as our project partner, the Daycare Trust, these include IPPR, Child Poverty Action Group, Family and Parenting Institute, Barnados, Save the Children, Gingerbread, the Resolution Foundation, the Work Foundation, the Fabian Society and the Trades Union Congress. Interested practitioners include childcare providers and primary school teachers and managers. They will gain a greater understanding of the ability of a key part of government policy on childcare to affect parental employment and children's outcomes. 

The economy. The economy will benefit from improved policymaking based on more accurate and relevant information about the benefits of such a large and expensive government intervention. To the extent that our findings lead to improved policy-making that helps mothers return to work, the economy will benefit through a broadening of the tax base and the retention of the skills needed for economic growth. Moreover, as our research contributes to making sure that children from deprived backgrounds benefit as much as possible from the educational element of childcare, the research will contribute to reducing inequalities in society and enabling each child to reach its full potential, with benefits to economic performance in the long run.

Families. This research concerns a large-scale government intervention which directly affects over 1 million children a year in England and their families. Our findings about the impact of early education or childcare on children's outcomes will be of interest to many parents and will help them make decisions about the use of childcare. Moreover, mothers will benefit if improved policies enable them to return to work if they wish, and so help reduce the gender wage gap and advance gender equality.

Private companies. Private companies rely on a skilled workforce, so improvements in policies that target child development and maternal labour supply will help them to retain valued employees (mothers) in the short term and develop a well-trained, broad workforce (today's children) in the long term.

Media/the general public. We anticipate that the outputs of this project will be of interest, as issues to do with maternal employment and the use of childcare are popular topics with the media. Many people will relate to, or have an opinion about, our findings, so the public will benefit from a discourse about these topics.

The project team. The PI on this project (Rabe) has not previously led a project of this size and will acquire additional managing skills. The team will benefit by broadening their research profiles and by establishing cooperation between ISER and IFS.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145042</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Surrey</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Nuffield Foundation funded childcare project</gtr:description><gtr:id>D369F5A9-A807-4776-BAD2-07900AB10A9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The collaboration has led to two jointly authored papers and many presentations, as detailed in the publications and engagement outputs.

In the UK, the coalition government recently published proposals designed to improve quality and increase parental choice, but all political parties continue to look at their policies towards pre-school childcare. As a contribution to this ongoing policy debate, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute for Social and Economic Research organised an international conference focusing on what we can learn from other countries' approaches to universal pre-school childcare, and how spending on and provision of childcare in the UK compares to other OECD countries. This took place at the British Academy in London on 8 May 2013, 10am-4pm.

We reported the findings of our project to a cross-Government group, including HMT, HMRC, DWP and DfE (including the Child Poverty Unit) as well as to DfE on various occasions. The minister for Childcare and Education, Sam Gyimah, was briefed on our research and it helped him in thinking through the Government's position before giving evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Affordable Childcare, to which our research team also contributed by submitting both written and oral evidence.

Our finding that free childcare had little impact on children's development and maternal labour supply because the offer displaced existing childcare use was used by officials and ministers at DfE to explicitly think through the planned expansion of the early years entitlement to 30 hours for working families. The objectives of educational attainment, affordability and maternal employment were separated out and the focus of the planned expansion put on affordability. 

Our expertise in childcare and evaluation of childcare policy is continuing to feed into the work of DfE. For example, Brewer is working with Ipsos Mori on the annual DfE report on parents use of childcare and on a project for HMRC and DfE (with Frontier Economics) on how to best evaluate the tax-free childcare and the extension of free childcare to 30 hours. Blanden is a member of the childcare funding review roundtable. Moreover, we will present to Treasury on maternal employment.

We are also actively engaged with practitioners and non-government organisations. For example, Brewer is on an advisory group for an ippr project on how childcare funding and delivery mechanisms could be improved to create better outcomes for children and parents. Moreover, we have fed into the Nuffield Foundation review on early years education and childcare which has led to the establishment of a new funding stream in Early Years. Moreover, we will have opportunity to further engage with non-government audiences at the launch of the Nuffield Foundation- funded project on the effects of childcare with which we have partnered.

Debates on childcare policy are ongoing in England, Wales and Scotland, and it is foreseeable that policy will continue to develop and change over the coming years. We expect that our research findings will be used in the coming years, but it is too early to say what impact they will have on particular policies.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D135AEDA-6CEE-45A3-9F05-F4CA105E8011</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project uses a variety of data sources - most notably the Labour Force Survey, National Pupil Database, Millennium Cohort Study and Census data - as well as a range of methodologies to examine the causal effect of free childcare provision on child educational outcomes and maternal labour supply. Three of the four research papers we have produced examine the effect of free entitlement to part-time childcare for 3 year olds, and we are the first to provide a causal analysis of this policy; our fourth paper focuses on the impact of having a child eligible to attend full-time schooling (reception class) on mother's employment. We find positive and statistically significant effects on both child outcomes in school and on maternal labour supply. These effects are relatively small, however, and in the case of child outcomes fairly short lived. For every 100 places funded around 6 more mothers whose youngest child is 3 move into work. Making available free places for 3 year olds increases school assessment scores at age 5 by around 4% compared to no funding, but these effects fade out quickly and no benefit remains at age 11. There is little evidence that that the policy disproportionately benefitted children from disadvantaged backgrounds, suggesting that it has not worked to close the gap in attainment between those from richer and poorer families.

We find that the main reason the policy has had little impact was that it did not significantly change parent's use of childcare. 82% percent of three-year old children were already accessing some form of childcare place in 1999 before the age 3 entitlement came into effect. Of six places funded under the policy only one was a new place taken up by a child that would not otherwise have attended nursery. Another way of looking at the impact of the policy is to see how parents respond when their child becomes old enough to be eligible for the free entitlement (at the start of the term after they turn 3). Only about 10 percent of children take up a place as a result of becoming eligible. One reason for this is that childcare places primarily become vacant in September when older children leave to go to school, so this limits the access to a funded place for autumn and spring born children.

In our research we used more data sources than originally anticipated. Some of these data resources are relatively unexplored and their use has added value to our analysis. For example we have used various versions of the 'Parent's Demand for Childcare Survey' to explore the socio-economic composition of children taking up childcare as a result of the free entitlement. We have also put together data on other early years initiatives that were active in the same time-period (to use as control variables), and are planning to explore some aspects of childcare quality using the Early Years Census.

For the work on child outcomes our project has partnered with another team that had funding from the Nuffield Foundation to do similar research. This has led to a fruitful collaboration with colleagues from Surrey University and the Institute of Education and has meant that our dissemination activities were broader than they otherwise could have been.</gtr:description><gtr:id>80429693-7643-4677-ADF5-B13FAA8B65BD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Oral evidence to the Select Committee on Affordable Childcare</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>759818B6-6CD2-4619-8FD9-7E09BE4D26E5</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Main/Player.aspx?meetingId=16200</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in expert workshop with MP Lucy Powell</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2046180C-2BCE-4F71-9A1A-46F3C47AE69D</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice to Frontier Economics on DfE and HMRC project on childcare</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C99CC9CB-2ED8-40AA-8EA8-A341B8598CF7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in House of Lords report on Affordable Childcare</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F1A11FC8-C39C-484F-901E-80CD6572CFDC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/ldaffchild/117/117.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written evidence to the Select Committee on Affordable Childcare's Call for Evidence</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>624C4CDF-0A37-413E-ACF9-86958B01651A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/affordable-childcare-committee/affordable-childcare/written/11718.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Written evidence to the Select Committee on Affordable Childcare's Call for Evidence (2)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8B99247A-A958-4EA9-8826-506BC95176F7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/affordable-childcare-committee/affordable-childcare/written/11695.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Nuffield Foundation document</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>43918696-A1F9-4D6F-9CA3-5FCB0584D926</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in systematic reviews</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/sites/default/files/files/Early_years_education_and_childcare_Nuffield_FINAL.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Give expert input into Southwark and Lambeth Childcare Commission, led by Rt.
