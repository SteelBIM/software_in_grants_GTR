Paradata are a by-product of the data collection process capturing information about that process. Typical examples are interviewer observations about a sampled household and interviewer call record data, capturing information such as date and time of each call attempt to a household. Awareness of the potential benefits of paradata has grown amongst both data producers and data users.&lt;br />&lt;br />The key objectives of this research are to investigate the uses of paradata for cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys with the aim of improving field process management and intervention decisions during data collection.The methodological development on how best to use such paradata in statistical models plays another key area.The research is organised into three sub-projects which:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>investigate the use of call record data and interviewer observations to study nonresponse in longitudinal surveys&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>provide insights into the effects of interviewing strategies and other interviewer attributes on response in cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>gain knowledge about the measurement error properties of paradata, in particular interviewer observations.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Analysis techniques include multilevel, discrete-time event history and longitudinal data analysis methods. Dissemination includes a short course and an international workshop on paradata.&lt;br />&lt;br />Further information is available from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.southampton.ac.uk/s3ri/research/projects/the_use_of_paradata_in_cross_sectional_and_longitudinal_surveys.page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;>project website&lt;/a>&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>330413</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation: Analysing Call Record Data in Longitudinal Surveys</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3869F6B1-3057-4565-BD88-EEEF1439223A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My talk on modelling length and outcome of call sequences sparked a range of questions as well as comments.

The course participants were very interested in the course and found the course to be directly related to their current research and survey practice work. The majority of course participants came from statistical offices and statistical agencies, from within the UK, Europe and overseas (e.g. Office for National Statistics, Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Iceland and Ireland). A number of course participants came from market research organisations such as Ipsos Mori. 
Course participants comments included: &amp;quot;course handout/packs very good and useful&amp;quot; &amp;quot;very good resource pack, structure and theory then some in-depth analysis for learning process&amp;quot;; sequence analysis and modelling was regarded as particularly useful; &amp;quot;I think that students had very different amounts of prior knowledge. every speaker was able to perfectly include everyone. That is really amazing&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;the webparadata session was great, Mario was really good and the first session on second day was very useful for my work (Gaby and Olga).&amp;quot;; &amp;quot;excellent course very well taught, thank you!&amp;quot;
Based on the answers from the course evaluation forms, all course participants agreed or strongly agreed that the content was interesting; that the event was well structured; the course material was useful; the speaker's level of knowledge was good or very good, the clarity of explanations were clear or very clear.

Establishing contact is an important part of the response process and effective interviewer calling patterns are critical in achieving contact and subsequent possible cooperation. Recent developments in the survey data collection process have led to the collection of so-called process data or paradata, which greatly extend the basic information on interviewer calls. The project to be presented aims to bui

The project comprised a short course and a very successful research symposium and user workshop. (For example, more than 60 % of participants from the short course were from non-academic backgrounds. They came from statistical offices and market research organisations, from within the UK, elsewhere in Europe and overseas (e.g. Office for National Statistics, Statistical Offices of the Republic of Slovenia, Iceland and Ireland; Ipsos Mori). 
As a result of our activities, publications and presentations, we were approached by Statistics Sweden to consult on their design of the Labour Force Survey. In times of increased survey costs, survey practitioners are very interested in cutting down on the number of calls and interviewer efforts made during data collection. This work is directly guided by our publication in the Journal of Survey Statistics and Methodology (2015), which modelled the likelihood of response to the survey request and interviewer call sequence length. This consultancy work is ongoing and we continue to advice Statistics Sweden on new and improved forms of data collection. The ONS has also expressed a high interest in our work on informing the reduction of the number of calls during data collection. They are also currently investigating possibilities for improvements based on our work in their household surveys. The work therefore impacts on increasing the effectiveness of public services and data quality. 
The project also prepared the ground work for another successful grant, the Bayesian Adaptive Survey Design Network funded by the Leverhulme Trust. This project brings together international academic and non-academic experts in the area of paradata and survey designs to improve responsive survey designs, including experts from the US Census Bureau, CBS Netherlands and the UK Office for National Statistics. Again, models and substantive findings from this project are being shared and developed further. The findings from the project also provided direct ideas for the successful ESRC NCRM research workpackage 1 grant. The work also directly informed the topics for 2 PhD theses. Furthermore, the work on paradata in surveys informed our current work on using paradata in the context of online surveys and mobile device use. This is of relevance since many key UK surveys are developing or have recently implemented online response modes. In particular, the next UK Census has the target of delivering 75% of responses via the online mode. Work in this area of paradata obtained through online modes will be informative in designing the next UK Census.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>7DAF6687-FAA1-40F3-BDD8-86531DB9DB5D</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key objectives of this research grant were to explore the uses of paradata for cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys with the aim of gaining knowledge that leads to improvement in field process management and responsive survey designs. The development of methodology to make best use of such paradata in statistical models also played a key role. The research project was organised into three interlinked subprojects with the specific aims of: 1) investigating the use of call record data and interviewer observations to study nonresponse in cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, 2) providing insights into the effects of interviewing strategies and attributes on response, and 3) gaining knowledge about the measurement error properties of paradata. 
The study has produced a wealth of findings which are outlined in detail in the 12 papers from this project. The key findings are described for each subproject:

1.) Paradata exhibits a complex multilevel structure which needs to be reflected in a statistical model analysing such data. Multilevel discrete time event history models were developed to analyse best times to establish contact and cooperation. Time varying call record information, such as features of the call history and of the current call, play a key role in predicting the outcome of each call. Interviewer observations, e.g. on the type and condition of the house and the presence of dependent children, proved to be useful for predicting the likelihood of cooperation. The novel application of sequence analysis of call record data identified a categorisation of sequences based on length and outcome. Subsequently the project developed models to predict length and final outcome of call sequences. We found that including information from the most recent call outcome very significantly improves prediction. The models developed are currently being used by Statistics Sweden to reduce the number of unproductive calls in the Swedish Labour Force Survey. 
When analysing the risk of nonresponse bias during data collection, the R-indicator, a measure commonly used after data collection, was shown not to perform well and the use of the delta index and the coefficient of variation are recommended instead. A key finding is that survey estimates tend to stabilise after about 5 calls indicating potential to stop calling after that reducing the number of unproductive calls made.

2.) The research developed multilevel cross-classified and multiple membership models to analyse interviewer effects in a longitudinal survey. The substantive results indicated strongly that the most recent interviewer has the highest influence of nonresponse across waves of a longitudinal survey contrasting earlier findings. The substantive findings confirm that interviewer experience, grade and continuity are significant predictors of non-response, whereas a significant role of interviewer personality traits could not be proven. Regarding the analysis of doorstep interactions, interviewer's experience and confidence of the interviewer were found to play a key role with more experienced and more confident interviewers showing higher likelihoods to achieve cooperation.

3.) Whilst paradata may be subject to measurement error our study revealed a generally high agreement between the interviewer observations and the Census reports, which implies that the interviewer observations we analyzed suffer from minimal measurement error.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project reached out to a wide academic audience, comprising researchers in Statistics and Survey Methodology, and researchers in social science disciplines using data from social surveys. The impact of the research has been through academic publications and working papers (15 so far), an edited special issue in an international journal, more than 35 conference papers, 4 sessions at international conferences, an international research symposium and a short course. 
Furthermore, the research has already been taken forward by Statistical Offices, in particular Statistics Sweden, with which we are closely collaborating. They are currently implementing the models we developed on predicting length and outcome of call sequences to the Swedish Labour Force Survey. The aim is to reduce the number of unsuccessful call sequences leading to potentially very significant cost reductions. The UK Office for National Statistics has also expressed high interest in some of our findings and models, again with the aim of reducing the number of unproductive calls and to control for nonresponse bias. The work will also help market research organisations and other survey organisations to improve their data collection processes. The work on interviewer effects will impact on interviewer selection and training. Knowledge on the measurement error properties of paradata and interviewer observations will help to improve the collection of such data.
