The main aim of the proposed research is to investigate the underlying causes of this productivity weakness in the UK, examining in particular the mechanisms by which the banking sector crisis might have affected the supply side of the UK economy and how it has affected company performance. These mechanisms are identified by examining differences in the performance of individual companies or sectors according to their reliance on bank finance in order to grow. The research also examines the importance of other factors, unrelated to tight credit conditions, that may have helped protect UK employment at the expense of productivity during the recent downturn, analysing company- and sector-level data from a range of secondary data sources, and highlighting patterns in the data consistent with different explanations for the productivity slowdown. Understanding the reasons for recent productivity weakness is of first order importance to macroeconomic policy. The research aims to contribute evidence to the current policy debate on the importance of demand versus supply side explanations for the recent weakness of UK economic performance.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The research is highly policy relevant. It investigates the underlying causes of the sharp drop and sluggish growth in UK productivity since the financial crisis, examining in particular the mechanisms by which the banking sector crisis might have affected the supply side of the UK economy, and how it has affected company performance. Understanding the reasons for productivity weakness is of key importance for economic policy. On macroeconomic policy, different explanations would have different implications for how quickly output can expand when demand in the economy recovers (they imply different magnitudes of the output gap) and therefore the appropriate stance of fiscal and monetary policy; while on microeconomic policy, they would have implications for the design of appropriate support measures for business, and for policy on the banking sector and credit markets. Yet, hitherto, there has been little progress in discriminating between different explanations for the productivity slowdown. Both the Monetary Policy Committee and Office of Budget Responsibility have highlighted the 'productivity puzzle' as worthy of more in-depth research. Other policy-makers that are beneficiaries of this research include the Bank of England more widely, HM Treasury, and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills. 

The wider public (UK residents) and UK companies are indirectly beneficiaries of this research, in so far as the research contributes to the effectiveness of policy geared at enhancing UK economic performance and the economic competitiveness of the UK. 

The research will also provide valuable experience for the research staff involved, building the national skills base in the analysis and interpretation of large and complex datasets.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-03</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>145159</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>The Impact of the Financial Crisis on UK Company Performance; Glasgow Economics seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B4410C40-DCF8-4084-B383-F585B83069C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at University of Glasgow Economics Seminar series.

This is seen to be of first-order importance for the setting of monetary and fiscal policy, with potentially significant impacts on overall living standards. For example, one prominent concern is the role of banking sector impairment in directly contributing to productivity stagnation through resource misallocation. While this has had traction with policymakers, we provide evidence that, in and of itself, this may not be as important as some commentators have suggested. 

We have communicated our findings widely through publications and presentations where senior policy makers have participated, organising a special session at the RES conference April 2014 on &amp;quot;The Impact of the Financial Crisis on UK Company Performance&amp;quot; involving key academics and policy makers. A summary of this session was included in the official RES Newsletter. We edited a special issue of the National Institute Economic Review on &amp;quot;Financial Crisis and Economic Performance&amp;quot; and organised a NIESR seminar to launch the issue, involving speakers from the Bank of England and senior academics. Early findings were discussed at project user group meetings. The project user group included key stakeholders (HMT, BIS, OBR, MPC). We also held meetings with Bank of England researchers involved in similar research and have disseminated our findings through participation in roundtable events at the TUC and the Work Foundation, as well as research meetings at BIS and IPO. Draft working papers have been circulated and are in the process of being sent to academic journals for peer review. 

While the research results have not been disseminated fully yet, they have had some influence on the national debate about the productivity puzzle. For example, our findings have been cited in a Financial Times article on UK productivity weakness and project papers have been cited in recent speeches by MPC members (Martin Weale and Kristen Forbes) and in the Bank of England's Quarterly Bulletin article on productivity (2014 Q2). Outputs have also been cited in the Bank's Discussion Paper setting out their future research agenda. 

The project has also contributed new research capacity to the business micro-data user group community. Project researchers have gained significant further experience and understanding of major UK business micro-datasets. The analysis datasets developed in this project (from FAME and the ARD) and the methodological experience gained have led to additional research funding to further examine UK business performance in the recession: from the Low Pay Commission to investigate the relationship between the National Minimum Wage and business outcomes during the recession; and from the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts to further investigate the efficiency of resource allocation in the UK. 

The research has made extensive use of existing secondary data sources, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages and we have actively engaged with data providers (Secure Data Service &amp;amp; ONS), including by a presentation to the ONS Annual Business Survey team of a policy relevant use of the ABS micro data.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>E108226D-EE04-41E6-A390-35BD2A4DEC72</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research investigates the mechanisms and extent to which the stagnation in UK productivity growth since the recession of 2008-9 is related to the crisis in the banking sector. Here we outline key findings from our analysis. 

Lending by UK banks to private non-financial companies has fallen consistently since 2008. This is different to the US where growth in bank lending to similar companies resumed after 2010. Our review of the evidence and analysis of Companies House data suggests that bank weakness was associated with a reduction in credit supply to UK companies, affecting companies that were more exposed to weak banks.

We explore how this credit supply shock relates to sectoral performance (reference 1). We find that output declined by more in sectors characterised as relatively bank dependent compared to that in less bank-dependent sectors, consistent with banking sector weakness reducing the supply capacity of the UK economy. But, at the sector level, we find no clear relation between bank dependency and the productivity short-fall relative to trend.

There are a number of channels through which a banking crisis might reduce productivity growth and the supply capacity of the economy by hampering the efficiency of resource allocation. Using ONS business micro data we decompose aggregate productivity growth relative to trend into contributions from changes in productivity within firms and, separately, from the reallocation of resources across more and less productive firms (reference 2). This analysis suggests a widespread reduction in productivity (labour productivity and total factor productivity) within incumbent firms that survived the recession. This points to the importance of factors not specifically related to the crisis in the banking sector in explaining aggregate productivity weakness. Nevertheless, we find evidence that banking sector weakness dampened productivity growth to a more limited extent by reducing the efficiency of resource allocation across firms.

Analysing Companies House data we find that banking sector weakness is likely to have led to an increase in company deaths amongst exposed companies, consistent with international evidence (reference 3). We find that credit constrained companies were more likely to reduce their capital stocks relative to what they might otherwise have done. This may have adversely affected companies' productivity, e.g. via capital labour substitution, but direct evidence of this link is less clear.

Estimating firms' labour demand using ONS business micro data we find evidence that weak labour costs have enabled firms to retain labour since the financial crisis. We find little evidence that firms have demanded labour in excess of what might have been expected given the path of wages and output (i.e. little evidence of labour hoarding). This is also true for firms that tend to be more reliant on skilled workers.

In conclusion, it is evident that the banking sector has reduced credit supply to UK companies. Our research suggests this has had a noticeable impact on the performance of some companies and sectors, but the relationship to productivity is complex and dependent on other factors such as wage flexibility.

Subject to future funding, we plan to explore the potential for further research in this area using linked longitudinal business datasets.

As noted above we have communicated our findings through publications and presentations where senior policy makers have participated. While it is difficult to isolate the effect of our own contribution, our analysis provides contextual evidence to a live debate that affects the setting of monetary and fiscal policy with potentially significant impacts on overall living standards (see e.g. reporting of our research in the RES newsletter). For example, one concern that has been prominent in the debate is the role of banking sector impairment in directly contributing to productivity stagnation through resource misallocation. We provide evidence that, in and of itself, this may not be as important as some commentators have suggested. All things considered, this has implications for the appropriate stance of monetary policy. 

We have also made extensive use of existing secondary data sources, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. We would hope that one outcome of our project will be to contribute to improvements in the collection and linking of different sources of company-level data so as to avoid some of the pitfalls of small useable sample sizes hindering scientific enquiry and understanding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D25073E6-A386-4CB1-BA49-C424C59C00A9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.niesr.ac.uk/projects/impact-financial-crisis-uk-company-performance</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in OECD Employment Outlook</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A80CA450-3871-4522-8B91-B3CB8C583401</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This evidence has been used in support of minimum wages.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.oecd.org/els/oecd-employment-outlook-19991266.htm</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Productivity Plan</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FC1A7D8E-9FD1-48D5-8D7D-2C584282CA80</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/443898/Productivity_Plan_web.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Summer Budget</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CCB858A3-0935-4473-ABC7-BF30B26E5EB3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our research evidence on the impacts of the National Minimum Wage on businesses was cited in support of the introduction of the new National Living Wage.
