It brings together high-value engineering disciplines whose products could deliver a step change in business benefit and provide the urgent transformational changes/new approaches needed by industry in order to survive and secure a competitive edge. Unfortunately, technology alone cannot provide the answers - instead systems engineering has the potential to deliver innovative solutions through the integration of people, processes, technologies and business practice. 

The term 'Systems engineering' is used here, to indicate the broad area of relevant research including complexity science, systems science and systems engineering, and has deliberately steered clear of a precise definition. Systems engineering spans the fields of aerospace, automotive, biological systems, built environment, construction, cyber-security, defence, energy, environment, healthcare, homeland security, manufacturing, rail, security, transport, utilities (gas electricity &amp;amp; water). 

Whilst aspects of systems research in the UK are broad, multi-disciplinary and vibrant, it urgently needs to develop coherence, leadership and focus to stay ahead of competition from other countries. In order to improve the UK's standing in the field, the UK urgently needs to develop more potential future leaders (both in academia and industry). 

The proposed systems network (Systems-NET) will enable a strategic and long lasting alliance with a view towards providing coordination and capability shaping of systems engineering within the UK as well as fostering development of future academic and industry leaders. Systems-NET is founded on the need to focus basic research at TRL 1-4, complemented by a strategically defined portfolio of network activity in applied research and technology transfer, building upon work of the EPSRC systems workshops within the EPSRC landscape of developing capability, shaping leaders for the future and formulating Grand Challenges for the UK's research community. The plan is to deliver a transformative route to safeguard long-term sustainability of systems engineering in the UK.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Systems engineering provides the means to retain and grow competitiveness in a challenging market place in order to deliver the necessary innovations in products/services. The inherent complexities associated with today's systems make their development, evaluation and eventual production more challenging than conventionally engineered products. Realisation of more products in a shorter timescale will directly support both national and global economic growth but also ultimately contribute to improved public finances through reducing the escalating long term costs associated with development of complex systems. 

The establishment of a UK network based on systems engineering research will assist in attracting inward investment to the UK from product developers who are suffering from a global skill deficit. It will create skilled employment opportunities and boost product, technology and knowledge based exports. The network will have many levels of economic impact through supporting the growth of high value industries through their adoption of systems engineering. Key industrial collaborations will assist UK located large companies and SME's in understanding the commercial value of systems engineering and other enabling technology products, product development, and in developing cost effective manufacturing approaches. 

The technological impact to improve product development and manufacturing process will be rapid as Systems-NET builds on the momentum and work established with partners under our current engagements in systems. The economic benefit will build over the first few years as technological and methodological development enable industrial partners to meet milestones, reduce risk and therefore attract investment. We anticipate the Systems-NET's activities will have visible impact in this area within five years through traceable contributions to key product successes in this emerging industry.

The clear economic and policy impacts will only be realised if Systems-NET transforms the product development and manufacturing status of the UK's manufacturing and service industries. We are in a unique position to achieve this through developing an internationally competitive lead by establishing industry informed Grand Challenges for systems research and cross-sector engagement of focussing academic teams on solving real problems presented through our industrial collaborators. This momentum will ensure early impact from Systems-NET. The Systems-NET Steering Group will ensure continued impact by representing the voice of industrial stakeholders and guiding the research, as well as providing a direct route back to industrial application. Consequently, the impact of the network will be in three key areas and fits perfectly with EPSRC's landscape of developing capability, delivering impact and shaping leaders for the future. The reports 'National Infrastructure Plan' and 'Systemic Risks and Opportunities in UK Infrastructure' identify significant opportunities for the systems engineering community with some &amp;pound;250 billion in the pipeline for infrastructure over the next decade. 

Policy forming and regulatory bodies will benefit from Systems-NET's industrially informed influencing studies and workshops. Public policy will be influenced by the preparation and dissemination of evidence documents to key stakeholders and by active participation by Systems-NET partners in key national and international fora and networks.

A large body of work has been devoted in 
expositing its numerous aspects, yet means for quantitatively assessing it have been scarce. 
Part of the challenge lies in the absence of hard evidence supporting the hypothesis that projects can be considered as complex systems, where techniques
for measuring complexity and its implications are better established. Working towards clarifying this hypothesis, The presentation will: 
(a) present evidence from a comparative study that sheds lights into the relationship between engineering projects and complex systems; and (b) present a framework for quantifying an aspect of project complexity using readily available data. Shifting focus to the implications of this relationship, It: (c) introduced a model to assess the probability of a failure cascade to impact a project, where a failure cascade is defined as the number of tasks affected by the failure of a single task. Insight from this model indicate that: (i) large failure cascade s can occur for the exact same reason as small ones do, and hence, challenge narrative based explanations for project failure; (ii) the likelihood for large failure cascades to take place is much higher than anticipated, and (iii) local mitigation action, in the form of increased resource efficiency, is both ineffective and insufficient in containing such failures</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/media/wwwlboroacuk/content/systems-net/downloads/pdfs/WebinarCE18May2016.pdf</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>At the intersect of Network Science and Systems Engineering</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>262CC387-CC5A-4755-A509-9878EF3034AD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Network Science is quickly establishing itself as the principal scientific field for the study of complex, socio-technical systems. Yet its scientific focus often neglects the consequent, practical implications of the derived insight. At the same time, the majority of these systems are designed by Systems Engineers, who often solely emphasize on operational aspects with limited understanding on the theoretical underpinnings that drive these systems.
 
As such, this workshop targets the chasm between the two by initiating a dialogue between the two disciplines. Specifically, the aim of this workshop is to bring together participants from industry and academia to discuss how network science tools can be applied in systems engineering to enhance our ability to manage/deliver complex systems. This workshop will also discuss the challenges that exist in translating network knowledge into systems engineering.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/activitiesandevents/workshopnetworkscienceandsystemsengineering/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sustainable and Resilient Water Infrastructure: flood risk and resilience</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21274693-FA5E-4EDB-9C98-D7EB71E00D4B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop &amp;quot;Sustainable and Resilient Water Infrastructure: flood risk and resilience&amp;quot; gathered researchers from industry and academia to discuss the main challenges for a resilient water infrastructure in the UK. Extreme weather events put water infrastructure at risk while population growth increases demand. In many cases the aging water infrastructure is not able to cope. There is a question of how water infrastructure can become resilient to floods? There is also another important question: Are current research efforts enough to ensure a resilient future? Or are there any gaps that need to be filled in order to ensure the adequate dealing of repeated flooding events? This workshop covered topics such as: linking community resilience and infrastructure resilience, natural flood management and catchment approach, flood risk management, flood risk modelling, drainage management in a changing climate, and various others. The workshop was a one-day event divided into two parts: first, a series of presentations from invited speakers and second, a workshop discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/activitiesandevents/brimworkshops/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Webinar Introduction to Complex Networks</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B256AED9-37DC-4C93-BD23-53BD07416227</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Webinar Introduction to Complex Networks was presented by Dr Samuel Johnson from The University of Warwick and it was organised by Systems-NET in order to communicate the current research in this topic to an audience of systems researchers.

Embedding ethics into cyber physical systems presents many challenges and these were discussed in the workshop.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/activitiesandevents/workshopethicsinautonomoussystems/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop Resilience of Clean and Waste Water Networks in the UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>34CBD6D3-268C-49CC-BF9B-3CD381ED49F7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Systems-NET organised this workshop to discuss how systems science and engineering can support the development of a water system over the next following decades that remains reliable as population grows, demand increases and climate changes.

Establishing a set of indicative grand challenges for systems engineering has the objective of inspiring a research agenda and bridge the gap that exists between academic knowledge and industrial concerns. In order to do this several presentations were given by some of the participants which were followed by workshop discussions and consensus in which all the participants contributed.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Study participants or study members</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/activitiesandevents/annualgrandchallengeworkshop/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Systems-NET has been funded by EPSRC with the rationale of adding significant value to the UK's industrial base by enabling development of key cross-sector engagements and contributing to solve some of the UK's emerging and future societal challenges. The UK systems community (academia, industrial and other stake holders) has the potential to achieve this provided it takes a coherent approach that is driven by real needs.

Systems-NET has accomplished this by:

- Identifying new research directions for the systems community which have been targeted by developing Systems Research Grand Challenges.

- Broadening the Research Base by contemplating research initiatives both in the UK and internationally

- Enabling delivery to industry by ensuring effective transfer of academic knowledge to industrial practice through academic/industry sector workshops and online webinars

- Disseminating case studies, workshop reports, presentations, research digest quad charts and post webinar event presentations via the Systems-NET website targeted to general and specialist viewers.

- Funding diversity in the growing systems community and promoting sustainability

- Developing future leaders capacity and capability.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>762627F7-D38E-4100-A239-B26CDC14F7AE</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project has almost completed and has identified new areas where systems thinking and systems engineering have the potential to address a number of significant grand challenges.

This network has also initiated another EPSRC Network - &amp;quot;Building Resilience into Risk Management' in order to tackle a number of the grand challenges identified by Systems-NET.

Each of the Grand Challenge areas merits further exploration and research due to the strong support from Industry and Academic sectors.

It is suggested that research calls be considered in each of the areas identified.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>27099434-0CE2-4711-8A7D-FFA3C189AF9E</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Systems-NET established a website to support networking activities for the UK Systems academic research community. The website served as an outreach public point where to advertise events such as webinars and workshops and opportunities for collaboration such as Immersive Secondments and the Visitor Scholar Scheme. The site also served to register members for the network, who could also register in the website to participate in any of the activities. Systems-NET was also designed to be a nexus for information on systems science, systems engineering and system thinking through links to books, journals, case studies and expertise. All the activities of the network have been advertised through this website.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F79C5D37-D445-4068-89C8-B4D0FD1EC4D2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There were 322 registrations to Systems-NET through this website and various other registrations to Systems-NET events.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Website for Systems-NET</gtr:title><gtr:type>e-Business Platform</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.lboro.ac.uk/research/systems-net/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/973D7B6F-1B9A-4CF8-B605-07C5140BCEDB"><gtr:id>973D7B6F-1B9A-4CF8-B605-07C5140BCEDB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Water Supply Resilience in the UK</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4f0d415e4746438647dfe381df295677"><gtr:id>4f0d415e4746438647dfe381df295677</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Styles G.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/82B34FBC-C428-4E61-B36C-D1D3F75EAF04"><gtr:id>82B34FBC-C428-4E61-B36C-D1D3F75EAF04</gtr:id><gtr:title>System Dynamics and Species Dispersal within Marine Ecosystems of the State of Florida USA</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/23b6703831c9a51cff7b1a6ad6d1658f"><gtr:id>23b6703831c9a51cff7b1a6ad6d1658f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Abram J.
