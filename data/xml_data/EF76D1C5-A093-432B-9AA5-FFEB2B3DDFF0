Our invention will be targeted, initially, at liquid/liquid extraction applications for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. The novel medium is a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel). It has two fluid domains which fill the sample in a convoluted arrangement and share a large mutual interface. The interface is stabilized by a layer of colloidal particles. This structure will be employed to bring two immiscible solvents into contact while they flow independently. Contact occurs at the interstices between the colloids. Our plan is to create a prototype membrane contactor and to use this to attract potential licensees. The patent for the invention of the bijel has already been filed.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2007-11-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2006-10-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89596</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Bijels are a new class of soft materials in which interpenetrating domains of two immiscible fluids are separated by a layer of colloidal particles. This layer is jammed and imparts rigidity to the entire structure. These materials were first predicted in 2005 by computer simulation and their existence confirmed in the laboratory in 2008. Since then we have continued to develop our capacity to create such materials with an ever increasing repertoire of fluid pairs and solid particle types. With US academic collaborators we have developed post-processing routes involving polymerization of one of the two phases, metallization of the interfacial structures, etc.. Bijels are arguably unique for (a) the conceptual simplicity of their preparation route (involving widely available and often inexpensive component materials); (b) their tri-continuous structure in which the interfacial film as well as both fluid phases spans space; and (c) the fact that the lengthscale of this structure can be easily controlled by varying the size and concentration of the colloidal particles that are added. On the other hand, the wettability of these particles needs to be carefully controlled and significant research effort has been devoted to understanding this aspect of the new technology.

Bijels are now an internationally patented technology and all inventors were employed by the University of Edinburgh at the time of their contribution. 

Although the development effort for this new technology remains focussed within academia, Dr Paul Clegg (who leads the experimental team involved in bijel formation) has established a number of commercial contacts ranging from multinational companies to SMEs. This reflects the breadth of possible future use of bijels in applications ranging from encapsulation, via consumer products, to the energy sector. Several of these companies have expressed strong interest but in most cases want to see working examples of bijels, with their choice of fluids and colloids, before engaging further in assessing the commercial potential in their sector.

Funding for research on bijels came from the Soft Matter and Statistical Physics Programme Grant (PI: Cates) until 2008 and the subsequent Soft Matter and Statistical Physics Grant Renewal from 2008 until 2012 (PI: Cates) as well as from a separate 'Follow on Grant' (PI: Clegg).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2005</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9D55C31F-BA33-4C48-97D6-417CFD5166F1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>That we could successfully prepare a fully three dimensional sample of our medium: the bijel.

That the small particles, used in our medium, have surfaces which play an important role in the fabrication process. 
That we could file a patent on our discovery.
Via a market assessment we found that the market for microfluidics devices is full or promise.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This technology might also be exploited to make electrodes for batteries or fuel cells.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C4255DE4-6223-423E-84C8-AB9C55EC6ABD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B6055C4C-7F14-4478-9998-0BB211F3F115"><gtr:id>B6055C4C-7F14-4478-9998-0BB211F3F115</gtr:id><gtr:title>Influence of particle composition and thermal cycling on bijel formation</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/73ffaac9e59ce4ff4c9566ef8432a1d8"><gtr:id>73ffaac9e59ce4ff4c9566ef8432a1d8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>White K</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/29C7253E-B41E-400E-A54B-380CB56327AD"><gtr:id>29C7253E-B41E-400E-A54B-380CB56327AD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Bicontinuous emulsions stabilized solely by colloidal particles.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Nature materials</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d5bcff9d631b96c8beb839350948ac69"><gtr:id>d5bcff9d631b96c8beb839350948ac69</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Herzig EM</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2007-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1476-1122</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3F0F4E14-E073-48B9-BB4E-61F0D2A9C09B"><gtr:id>3F0F4E14-E073-48B9-BB4E-61F0D2A9C09B</gtr:id><gtr:title>The bijel: a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/94cb8174320426089320adb78c8c6f18"><gtr:id>94cb8174320426089320adb78c8c6f18</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Paul Clegg (Author)</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2008-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/51571866-B8A5-44B3-85C1-C83B2852524A"><gtr:id>51571866-B8A5-44B3-85C1-C83B2852524A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Fluid-bicontinuous gels stabilized by interfacial colloids: low and high molecular weight fluids.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of physics.
