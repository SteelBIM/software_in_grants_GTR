So far, the main impact has been that there has been a very public discussion of something that had previously been an issue that was completely off-limits in 'polite society'. Anecdotally many people have told me that it has helped them open up conversations that they previously would not have felt able to have. Talking about issues like this in a public forum allows others to have conversations about the conversation they just witnessed i.e. depersonalises the conversation and also allows it to be mentioned in the first place ('did you hear that programme on the radio?')</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p026sv9x</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BMJ Open press release</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EB4F40A3-10D9-4376-A743-54BE8DEFED78</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Article press released by LSHTM and also by BMJ Open press office to their extensive network

As in other aspects of young people's lives, concepts of linearity have been utilised to classify sequences of practices - or 'sexual trajectories' - with a 'linear' sequence typically described as progressing from kissing to hand-genital contact to vaginal intercourse. Ideas about sexual sequence are also present in young people's own discourse, with the language of 'bases' being a common way of talking about early sexual activity.



Drawing on data from an ESRC-funded qualitative longitudinal study, we examine what young people perceive to be a 'normal' sequence of sexual practices amongst their age group, and how they account for their own, often more diverse, repertoires and sequences of sexual practices. This paper, therefore, complements a broader discussion about 'ordinariness' by contributing empirical data which challenges current discourses of 'normality' in relation to young people's sexual development.

After the second airing of the interview, various emails from members of the public were read out, suggesting that the programme had had a significant impact on at least those people who had corresponded with the programme afterwards. One said he was a sex educator and the interview would be an excellent way to facilitate discussion in his classes.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Researching young people's sexual practices in the UK : notes from a project in progress</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ADE7549C-41F0-4E5D-B525-95D7312F25DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An invited talk given to DHRes students at University of Hertfordshire as part of their research methods training.

We have spoken to numerous practitioners about our findings both formally via conferences and meetings and informally in other settings. Our findings have been covered in national and international media and have reached the public. Members of the public have contacted us directly to us to discuss our work, and have provided commentary on the work via BBC radio 4 and on numerous internet sites. This has particularly been the case for our work on coercive sexual activity. Work from this project has led to invitation to sit on an expert panel to inform government strategies to limit children's access to online pornography and is likely to influence the eventual policy in this area. Senior lawyers are interested in the work on coercion and conversations about this are ongoing. I am working with the World Health Organization developing guidelines in related work on child and adolescent maltreatment.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2011</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>64D616C1-4C9F-41CF-8375-825903C1693A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp;
