Charting the Impact of the Liberation Panther Party</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J001732/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The entry of Dalit (ex-Untouchable) movements into Tamil political institutions in the 1990s was a major milestone, but there has been no systematic study of their impact as yet.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This proposed ethnography of a Dalit party will offer detailed analyses of the conditions of activism and how Dalit activists and leaders negotiate institutionalisation. The project will deepen understandings of the interplay between caste and political representation and explore the potential inconsistencies between Dalit party politics and the concerns of those at the grass-roots. The Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK, Liberation Panther Party), are the most successful Dalit movement-turned-party in Tamil Nadu. Existing studies, however, have failed to capture the perceptions and actions of rank-and-file Dalit activists and voters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main aim of this project is to chart the VCK?s political integration at the grass-roots level. The research will probe whether and/or how the demands and critiques of Dalit movements have been integrated into wider political discourses and practices. It will, thus, address the openness of political systems to new actors and ideas, and representation in a caste-divided society. The key methods employed will be participant observation and interviews with active and non-active Dalits and Dalit leaders, policy-makers, analysts and NGO staff.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>172101</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Tata Institute of Social Sciences</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>India, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>This grant helped gain the UKIERI grant documented under further funding.

Articles published in Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly, Frontline and The Hindu have been widely circulated and discussed. I have published three op-ed pieces in The Hindu newspaper - the leading English language newspaper of record in the country - that draw on key aspects of my research. These have focused on the contentious caste 'census', on the social antecedents of caste violence and on new caste dynamics in south India. These pieces generated a series of comments and letters to the newspaper. Additionally, I co-wrote a paper on the symbolic and political significance of Ambedkar statues. This was carried in the issue of Frontline magazine - one of the most recognised current affairs outlets in India - which was launched by vice-President Hamid Ansari. I was also invited to contribute an overview of the interplay between caste and politics in Tamil Nadu for the well-respected and accessible organ of opinion and policy Seminar magazine in an issue devoted to contemporary caste dynamics. Evidence of the wider interest in the research is seen in that my papers for Seminar and The Hindu resulted in invitations for user-friendly analyses for Bheem Patrika - a Dalit journal in northern India; Manorama Yearbook - described as 'the largest selling general knowledge update in the country', and the well-known Centre Right India blog whose mission is 'to provide high-quality, independent analyses of political, social, and cultural issues that concern the Indian public and in doing so, strengthen Indian democracy'.
K.C. Narayanan, editor of Manorama Yearbook, for example stated: 'I write this note after reading your article in today's Hindu, on the caste violence in Tamil Nadu. It was really impressive and useful for those who are observing the changing scenario of caste politics in India'. Similarly, Prasanna, editor at Centre-Right India wrote: 'I recently read your outstanding essay in Seminar Magazine titled: Caste and Politics in Tamil Nadu. It was really perspicacious and offered a lot of insights I am hoping if you could write a column/essay covering the Tamil Nadu politics that you have explored as part of your research'. In November 2014, CNN-IBN requested an interview having read the Hindu article on the caste census, saying: 'it was such a great analytical piece on complex Indian society'. I have also co-authored three short pieces aimed at prompting debate and disseminating research findings in Economic and Political Weekly (EPW). EPW combines current affairs commentary with social research and brings 'academics, researchers, policy makers, independent thinkers, members of non-governmental organisations and political activists' into debate with each other over critical issues. The dissemination strategy for the project deliberately targeted such pieces as a means of reaching out to the activists and party members who are the core focus of the research. Blog pieces in activist focused sites like RoundTableIndia - a Dalit focused site that 'aims to focus on the twin objectives of generating information and interaction necessary to aid, in howsoever small way, the progress of the Dalits' - have enabled the research to reach a much wider audience. Finally, I have taken the research to a wider audience in the UK, by means of an appearance on Thinking Allowed (BBC Radio 4) to discuss my key findings with Laurie Taylor, and exchange in the letters page of the Financial Times about caste and capitalism. This engagement and dissemination has continued as analysis of the data has advanced. In 2014, I published three pieces drawing on my research in EPW. One co-authored piece on Caste and Vegetarianism has been widely discussed. I also contributed two analyses of Tamil politics to the new online media outlet: The Wire - which was set up by the former editor of The Hindu.
Educated members of the public were also reached through a series of public lectures in 2012 in Madurai, Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi. Each of these lectures was advertised in the local media and attended by between 30 and 50 people in each case. The lectures drew on data gathered in the field, and the talk in Madurai was delivered in English and Tamil for the benefit of local audiences. Wider engagement has occurred through a series of presentations and conferences including a workshop in Edinburgh that brought activists and academics together. The workshop focused on caste and politics in Tamil Nadu and was attended by a group of nearly 20 experts. Alongside leading academics, the workshop included key figures from the Dalit land-rights struggle and from Dalit politics. A panel on caste for the British Association of South Asian Studies annual conference was attended by a British Dalit activist keen to discuss caste issues. A workshop on institutionalisation and marginal actors has been published as a volume edited by Roger Jeffery, Suryakant Waghmore and I (From the Margins to the Mainstream, Sage 2016). It is expected to be of interest to user groups as well as academics.
Finally, I have also sought to take the findings of the research directly to user groups in a number of ways. Firstly I participated in a number of Dalit movement meetings and contributed to them. In June 2012, for example, I addressed a meeting of the party I was studying to offer feedback on findings to leaders and the members at the event. This was a public and widely advertised meeting that drew an audience of over 300 people including the central leader of the party and the talk was delivered in Tamil. This meeting was followed up with a brief resume of findings and all papers and articles have been circulated to key figures within the party. Furthermore, an interview that I conducted with a party leader has been published online in full. This has been taken up in several places and reprinted in several blogs in India. Finally, one of the General Secretaries of the party was invited to a conference of activists and academics in Edinburgh. He was unable to attend at the last minute, but joined the workshop by Skype and interacted with the participants and exchanged ideas and discussed key issues with us. The proceedings were written up and published in Seminar magazine. I have remained in contact with key figures in the party and sent copies of all outputs to them. In an interview with another research scholar, Gowthamma Sanna - propaganda secretary of the VCK - cited my work: 'When Hugo Gorringe presented a paper in our seminar, his concluding sentence stated, 'please work offline.' He advised us, &amp;quot;if you need to work online, it may prove beneficial, but you must also work offline&amp;quot; This is a very important observation because we also must do offline work'. Sanna sent a transcript of the interview to me and is looking to have it published soon.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C64889BF-EDFD-415F-B16E-C6F84CD5EF1F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In 1999 the Dalit Panther Movement abandoned a long boycott and entered electoral competition as the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK - Liberation Panther Party) amidst a fierce debate about the merits and demerits of political participation. The transformation occurred largely to avoid socio-political repression and pressure more than from any real faith in politics. Opponents insisted that politics was a sewer that would corrupt and defile the movement (Gorringe 2005). Over a decade later, I returned to find out what party members and Dalits on the ground make of the party's performance. In 2012 I revisited my earlier fieldsite and adopted a similar ethnographic approach. Research focused on Madurai district in south-central Tamil Nadu. I carried out 60 formal and 58 informal interviews and had countless conversations with party members, affiliates, and members of other Dalit organisations in villages, towns and cities in order to capture attitudes and changes since 1999. Several interviews were with activists I had interacted with in 1999, thus giving the research a longitudinal dimension. As in the earlier research, I also observed 24 key events held by the party or other Dalit outfits and captured the speeches as well as the atmosphere of the occasions. Finally, Roger Jeffery and I secured election data from CSDS enabling us to place the experiences of the VCK within a wider Indian context of Dalit politics.

Echoing the wider literature on activist institutionalisation, I discovered widespread disillusionment with the party. The intensity, awareness and mobilisation which characterised the movement in 1999 have decreased. Factional conflicts and distrust are now out in the open, and there is a persistent accusation that local leaders prioritise their own well-being over that of the party and the people. Becoming a party has also forced the VCK to reach out to non-Dalits, meaning that some Dalit respondents felt abandoned or betrayed. The ethnographic approach highlighted a disparity between media and leader perspectives of the movement and those of Dalits on the ground. Despite this, most Dalit respondents felt an attachment to the party. 

Analysis has focused on the following key areas:
1) The politicisation of caste (as seen in articles for Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly, The Hindu and Frontline): the central finding here relates to the wider social impact of Dalit mobilisation. The entry of autonomous Dalit parties to the mainstream has compelled other groups such as the communists to address caste discrimination directly, and prompted counter mobilisation on behalf of intermediate caste groups; 
2) The attempt to move beyond the Dalit category (as in the paper for The South Asianist): the bi-polar nature of Tamil politics means that Dalit votes alone are insufficient to gain electoral victories. My research charts their attempts to forge wider alliances by recourse to Tamil nationalism, and unpacks the processes involved. It is clear that this move has limited benefits for ordinary Dalits, and most parties continue to view the VCK as lesser partners; 
3) Processes that I have termed 'informal institutionalisation' that lead new parties to adopt particular ways of doing politics rather than just entering institutions (as seen in the papers in Still's volume and for Hyderabad and in my 2017 monograph): what I suggest is that analyses of institutionalisation need to pay more attention to the informal and social processes of change as well as the more formal and institutional ones. VCK priorities, for example, reflect new networks with established politicians rather than just a new way of doing formal politics; 
4) the gendered nature of party politics (as seen in papers in Ciotti's edited volume, for Kapadia and Anandhi's forthcoming volume and the FWSA): key findings here are that Dalit politics continues to be structured in ways that marginalise women's voices. Even as more women have joined the party, therefore, gender concerns have remained peripheral; 
5) Finally, the research has added insights into the political preferences of Dalits (with Roger Jeffery for Marginalisation Conference and volume): whilst the paper sheds some insights on voting in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, it also highlights the limits of survey data in this field and raises questions about how best to measure political participation. 
Additionally, unexpected findings to have emerged from the research relate to:
a) caste and film (a paper on this, co-authored with Karthikeyan, has been accepted by SAMAJ): we have related the rise of an aggressive Backward Caste politics based on pride and militancy to the neo-nativist films focused on Backward Caste identities from the 1980s onwards;
b) Debates over strategy and cultural politics (paper in Contributions to Indian Sociology, article in Frontline and seminar presented at UCL that became a chapter in my 2017 book): the CIS paper relates to ongoing and heated debate over the role of the parai drum in Dalit mobilisation. Whilst many Dalit activists celebrate it as a weapon in the Dalit struggle others are appalled that the symbol of caste humiliation is celebrated at all. In terms of cultural politics, my analysis of statues and VCK interventions in issues such as the cartoon controversy over the use of a carton of Ambedkar in school textbooks, highlights the materiality of symbolic politics. I argue against the distinction between 'real' and symbolic politics and call for more nuanced analysis of the wider impact of symbols and the processes that go into their production;
c) Finally, initial work in the field on the web presence of the VCK led to an invitation to address the party on the interplay between social movements and social media. 
Early indicators of the significance of my research include invitations to write for accessible magazines and blogs and to take part in a TV panel debate. I was also invited to an EHRC expert seminar on Caste in the UK and have subsequently teamed up with colleagues in Manchester and Mumbai to put together proposal on transnational Dalit activism that was submitted to the ESRC in September 2014. This was not successful, but has reinforced links with key scholars.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research has already had some user engagement and public dissemination (see narrative impact). Articles written for Seminar, Economic and Political Weekly and The Hindu have been widely circulated and discussed. I see the research as being of use to several core groups:
Firstly, the VCK itself: party activists and leaders have been kept informed of research outputs and findings and I have heard informally that they have been discussed by leaders. Key recommendations about party structure, strategy and focus could inform the party going forward.
Secondly, dissemination through accessible and widely read outlets means that the research may be of use in educating the general public and policy makers about continuing forms of caste discrimination. Economic and Political Weekly is widely read by academics, educated members of the public and policy makers, as is The Hindu. 
Thirdly, the research could be taken up and used by advocacy groups working for Dalit rights. C. Nicholas of the Dalit Land Rights Movement has noted the utility of my work in this regard.
Finally, the research will be of use to academics seeking to understand contemporary caste dynamics and the politics of caste in Tamil Nadu.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9BC2FF69-CDD3-4A12-8C01-B01AB87E66D8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sociology.ed.ac.uk/current_research/current/dalit_politics</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E16EF826-E022-42C0-9CDA-0D59A0C3C642"><gtr:id>E16EF826-E022-42C0-9CDA-0D59A0C3C642</gtr:id><gtr:title>Dalits and the Challenge of Caste Inequality in India</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Manorama Yearbook</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3a36ec3451de7ecae4f8119dc462c31f"><gtr:id>3a36ec3451de7ecae4f8119dc462c31f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gorringe, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/99BD50FE-363B-4DCF-AB91-A2828E42F341"><gtr:id>99BD50FE-363B-4DCF-AB91-A2828E42F341</gtr:id><gtr:title>Book: Dalits in Neo-Liberal India: Mobility or Marginalisation</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/3a36ec3451de7ecae4f8119dc462c31f"><gtr:id>3a36ec3451de7ecae4f8119dc462c31f</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Gorringe, H</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-1138020245</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5C2F6472-0574-4E5D-AA53-96C460FA861E"><gtr:id>5C2F6472-0574-4E5D-AA53-96C460FA861E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Drumming out oppression, or drumming it in?
