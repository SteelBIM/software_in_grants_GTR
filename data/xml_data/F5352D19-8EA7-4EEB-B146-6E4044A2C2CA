Education</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M010082/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The last two generations have seen a remarkable world-wide transformation of higher education (HE) into a core social sector with continually expanding local and global reach. Most nations are moving towards, or have already become, 'high participation' HE systems in which the majority of people will be educated to tertiary level. In the UK HE is at the same time a pillar of science and the innovation system, a primary driver of productivity at work, a major employer and a mainstay of cities and regions, and a national export industry where 300,000 non-EU students generated over &amp;pound;7 billion in export-related earnings for the UK in 2012-13. In 2012, 60 per cent of UK school leavers were expected to graduate from tertiary education over the lifetime, 45 per cent at bachelor degree level, compared to OECD means of 53/39 per cent. Higher education and the scientific research associated with universities have never been more important to UK society and government. HE is large and inclusive with a key role in mediating the future. Yet it is poorly understood. Practice has moved ahead of social science. There has been no integrated research centre dedicated to this important part of the UK. The Centre for Engaged Global Higher Education (CEGHE), which has been funded initially for five years by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), now fills that gap. 

On behalf of the ESRC CEGHE conducts and disseminates research on all aspects of higher education (HE), in order to enhance student learning and the contributions of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to their communities; develop the economic, social and global engagement of and impacts of UK HE; and provide data resources and advice for government and stakeholder organisations in HE in the four nations of the UK and worldwide. CEGHE is organised in three closely integrated research programmes that are focused respectively on global, national-system and local aspects of HE. CEGHE's team of researchers work on roblems and issues with broad application to the improvement of HE; develop new theories about and ways of researching HE and its social and economic contributions; and respond also to new issues as they arise, within the framework of its research programmes. An important part of CEGHE's work is the preparation and provision of data, briefings and advice to national and international policy makers, for HEIs themselves, and for UK organisations committed to fostering HE and its engagement with UK communities and stakeholders. CEGHE's seminars and conferences are open to the public and it is dedicated to disseminating its research findings on a broad basis through published papers, media articles and its website and social media platform. 

CEGHE is led by Professor Simon Marginson, one of the world's leading researchers on higher education matters with a special expertise in global and international aspects of the sector. It works with partner research universities in Sheffield, Lancaster, Ireland, Australia, South Africa, Netherlands, China, Hong Kong SAR, Japan and USA. Among the issues currently the subject of CEGHE research projects are inquiries into ways and means of measuring and enhancing HE's contribution to the public good, university-industry collaboration in research, the design of an optimal system of tuition loans, a survey of the effects of tuition debt on the life choices of graduates such as investment in housing and family formation, the effects of widening participation on social opportunities in HE especially for under-represented social groups, trends and developments in HE in Europe and East Asia and the implications for UK HE, the emergence of new HE providers in the private and FE sectors, the future academic workforce in the UK and the skills that will be needed, student learning and knowledge in science and engineering, and developments in online HE.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Centre for Engaged Global Higher Education (CEGHE) will conduct research designed to transform our understanding of higher education (HE) in its economic and social contexts. In the public and connected environment in and around HE, CEGHE's research and findings will interest government and policy makers, public agencies, stakeholder organisations in HE, associated sectors (e.g. employers and professions), HEIs, the media and public, international agencies such as the OECD, and many HEI leaders and policy makers-throughout the world. 

The main strategy to achieve ongoing impact is CEGHE's structured collaborations with Associated Organisations (AOs). At second stage submission the AOs included GuildHE, Higher Education Academy, Higher Education Policy Institute, Institute for Public Policy Research, National Centre for Universities and Business, National Union of Students, Social Market Foundation, Society for Research into Higher Education, Times Higher, Universities and College Union, Universities UK, Universities UK International Unit, Which?, and WonkHE. If CEGHE is funded more AOs may sign, including public HE agencies. The majority of the CEGHE Advisory Board (chaired by Professor Sir Robert Burgess) will be AOs,

AOs can be engaged in every stage: project design; on project committees; in preparing benchmarks for assessing impact; as participants in some data collection; and providing critical feedback on draft papers and the preparation of materials for different audiences. The release of findings will be double- or multi-badged with AOs and they will share the seminar programme and leadership of CEGHE conferences. In turn they will gain access to CEGHE research findings, influence the applications of the research, and position themselves effectively in subsequent national discussion. By working with CEGHE 'in the kitchen' they will be better placed to use its outputs. The AOs will enhance CEGHE's sensitivity to HEIs, policy makers and interest groups, and trigger many new initiatives in research and applications. They will be an invaluable source of informed comment at every stage of CEGHE's work. In addition, some organisations such as HEA have major data repositories of their own that may be accessible for CEGHE research purposes.

For policy makers and government, CEGHE will offer evidence-based data across a range of key issues in HE, and scope to enter a research based public discussion on an informed basis. Some projects will be of immediate policy interest, e.g. research on the growing private sector in HE, a data-based study of relations between financing and participation, a survey comparing graduates with and without debt, and the comparative international metrics on HE-industry engagement. CEGHE will prepare the ground with policy makers using selective briefings, and release main project findings at public events, engaging government ministers and officials. CEGHE's capacity to impact policy and government through research will often depend on the prior reception of its findings among stakeholders and in the media and public discussion. Media-significant data are more likely to gather public impact and shape policy thought. CEGHE will focus closely on media as this is the best way to reach large numbers of stakeholders. The Times Higher, one of the AOs, will co-sponsor seminars and conferences, and provide a principal medium for publicising outcomes and building stakeholder involvement.

CEGHE will sustain a seminar series in each Research Programme, combined 'Key Debates in HE' seminars and Early Career Researcher seminars, and three conferences, involving stakeholders and policy makers. Events will be held across UK including partner universities of Sheffield and Lancaster. The CEGHE website will be an ESRC research shop front for UK HE; continuously updated, it will be the Centre's point of dissemination and public data exchange, and a broad source of information about UK Higher Education.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4904058</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>The decline in entrants to part-time undergraduate study in England</gtr:description><gtr:id>DC89C89B-4B0C-4FC9-8526-E61F4725332E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>HEFCE shares the above work</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project is coordinated by Centre researcher Claire Callender.

The aim of this research is:
? to better understand the decline in entrants to part-time undergraduate study; 
? to assess to what extent it reflects a real reduction in the number of entrants, and 
? to identify the most likely causes of this reduction. 

This should enable us to assess the likely impact of future changes in policy, such as the increase in the number of subjects which will be exempt from equivalent or lower qualifications (ELQ) restrictions on student loans from 2017-18. It should also provide a foundation to develop other policies to halt or reverse the decline in part-time study. The study will also assess the contribution of part-time provision to reducing the discrepancies in the take-up of higher education between advantaged and disadvantaged social groups; that is to 'widening participation' policy.

It covers topics such as how best to use the technology to evaluate what works for learners, and how to track their learning; how technology can help with some of the main challenges tp the sector, e.g. by offering more flexible learning, encouraging more independent learning skills, and by sharing and working together perhaps we can also reduce the costs of innovation. In the final week it looks at how the educational organisation embraces this kind of change, and how participants can work with colleagues to make blended learning work most effectively.
The course runs wholly online, providing 4 study hours per week for 3 weeks. Activities include short videos, quizzes, discussions, and design activities that link to the Learning Designer tools.
More than 10,000 participants were enrolled in the course during the three runs of the course in 2016.
During the period when the Learning Designer tools were being used, usage peaked at more than 2000 in one day, and there were more than 20,000 unique visits to the website over a 4-week period, with 15,000 return visits, showing that the software continued to be used. Comments in the discussion forums were very enthusiastic about the prospect of using the tools, and sharing them with colleagues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-embedding-practice/1/steps/47766#fl-comments</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ANU/DPU/CEPAR Conference, &quot;Immigration, Ageing and the Labour Market&quot;, DPUniversity, Bangkok,  Bruce Chapman, Kiathianan Lounkaew and John Piggott</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6720D081-B9FC-4F3A-921E-91020C1D7985</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussions around the ageing population and the labour market/immigration - comparisons made.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article entitled 'Massive expansion of universities in Asia raises tough questions on social mobility' in The Conversation by Ka Ho Mok</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BA00FE2B-D7CC-49AD-B3E9-C732F0120914</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Commentary entitled 'Massive expansion of universities in Asia raises tough questions on social mobility' published in The Conversation.

The audience included university administrators and other practitioners, representatives of the funding body as well as policy-makers. The talk concerned the risks associated with the internationalisation of Irish universities as currently implemented. In particular, it drew the attention of the audience to the stratification of exchange programmes and the declining academic quality of programmes at the lower end. The organiser of the event reported that this issue was brought up at a high-level committee meeting, with reference to Aline Courtois's talk.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://irc-equality.ie/?p=517</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Article entitled 'What your choice of university degree means for your future earnings' in the Independent by Francis Green</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>70F8E0F7-59E0-4E98-AB14-5148384C6F72</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Commentary entitled 'What your choice of university degree means for your future earnings' published in the Independent.

It covers topics such as how best to use the technology to evaluate what works for learners, and how to track their learning; how technology can help with some of the main challenges tp the sector, e.g. by offering more flexible learning, encouraging more independent learning skills, and by sharing and working together perhaps we can also reduce the costs of innovation. In the final week it looks at how the educational organisation embraces this kind of change, and how participants can work with colleagues to make blended learning work most effectively.
The course runs wholly online, providing 4 study hours per week for 5 weeks. Activities include short videos, quizzes, discussions, and design activities that link to the Learning Designer tools.
More than 25,000 participants were enrolled in the course during the three runs of the course in 2015-16.
During the period when the Learning Designer tools were being used, usage peaked at more than 2000 in one day, and there were more than 20,000 unique visits to the website over a 4-week period, with 15,000 return visits, showing that the software continued to be used. Comments in the discussion forums were very enthusiastic about the prospect of using the tools, and sharing them with colleagues.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-getting-started/1/register</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar 12 Canada's incomplete conception of international student mobility: are we missing the boat?

Of the 15 ESRC supported projects, five began early in the Centre's life but the majority did not commence until the second half of 2016 and all but two of the Centre's post doc researchers have been in place for six months or less. Of the 15 projects only one has produced one preliminary part of its findings, which were released for the first time on 1 March 2017. Other project outputs to this stage are in the form of preliminary foundation papers planning the research, Working Papers, seminar and conference papers outlining the early stages of research, literature-oriented studies summarising other work in the relevant research area, and commentaries, blogs and other media coverage. There has also been one report on request for the then UK government department BIS, a comparative study of private sector higher education provision in six countries. CGHE's researchers have been highly engaged in many areas, have a large number of partnerships and collaborative projects between them, and have produced a substantial number of publications. Several have been involved directly in policy making processes in higher education, as the evidence in Research Fish attest. However, for the most part these activities relate to other ongoing research-related productions and commitments of the researchers, or reflect the early stages of the CGHE project work. Consequently it is too early to report either on project findings from the 15 ESRC-supported projects, or on the impact of these findings.

However, CGHE from its beginning has been focused on building impact, and the results of this will become more obvious in future Research Fish rounds. CGHE is building impact in two ways. First it has created a consultative structure with policy makers in higher education, public agencies, national education organisations, the higher education institutions, and other potential users of its research. Several stakeholders and research user organisations are members of the CGHE Advisory Board. There are currently 19 Associated Organisations signed up with CGHE, such as Universities UK and the National Union of Students, with a commitment to assist in future research output dissemination events, for example through jointly badged public events, and joint lobbying of government. Each of the 15 CGHE projects has a project committee which plays an advisory role throughout the duration of the research. Each project committee includes at least one person from a policy stakeholder such as HEFCE or a research user organisation such as UUK.

Second, CGHE has advanced the public discussion of higher education issues, and public engagement in its research projects - thus preparing the ground for future impact generation around its research findings - in several ways: public conferences (there have been two large and successful open public conferences in the first 16 months), weekly research seminars and occasional seminars and public discussion events, the many contributions of CGHE researchers to public media-based discussion of policy issues in higher education as listed in Research Fish under engagement, including articles, blogs and quotations, the live streaming of public conferences and seminars, public access to events through Youtube and Soundcloud, and an energetic social media presence. For example, the 2017 CGHE conference on 1 March 2017 had 233 livestream users, the hashtag #CGHE2017 was trending on twitter, Times Higher Education carried six separate articles on papers at the conference, and University World News had a special segment devoted to papers from the conference.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C80207EE-D726-4019-8309-0D9542F7D7A8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of international review panel for the institutional research evaluation of the University of Uppsala, Sweden, Jurgen Enders</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>23150564-D8A7-4FCC-835C-C371A6F6D3AE</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hazelkorn, Ellen: President, EAIR (European Higher Education Society)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2AA58698-7A25-4675-8B03-28146DB88C3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Elected to President of EAIR.

Over 35,000 registrations for the two courses (Blended Learning Essentials,:Getting Started and Embedding Practice), run on FutureLearn Over 54% of participants were from the UK, 56% from the VET sector and almost 60% are teachers or trainers. With further promotion, and the influence of the early participants in these three initial runs, we can expect that in time the courses could reach a high proportion of the intended workforce.

Impact on participants
Participants enrol on MOOCs such as BLE with a range of personal criteria for success, but completion rates for the courses (17%) have performed well in comparison with similar FutureLearn courses (12%). 
Participants' attitudes to blended learning were positive from the outset and post-course surveys indicated that they grew even more enthusiastic as a result of the course. 
Course surveys reported a drop from 49% to 25% of participants who felt nervous about using blended learning, and an increase from 39% to 64% who felt confident about using it appropriately.

Participant Engagement and Activity
Active engagement achieved across all parts of the course, including over 40,000 comments.
The majority of course steps have in excess of an 80% visit to completion conversion rate. 
Take-up of the accreditation pathways is also positive, 15% opted to buy a statement of participation and the CMALT pilot, run by ALT, was full. 

Impact on Teaching Practice
Pre- and post-course surveys show that: almost 90% of survey respondents note awareness of tools and technologies to support blended learning after the course compared to 45% beforehand. 
BLE has helped improve participants' confidence and attitudes towards blended learning: only 12% of respondents in the post-course survey now view their 'limited knowledge' of blended learning as a 'serious barrier' to using it, a significant drop from 56% in the pre-course survey.
The qualitative analysis of peer assessment, discursive activities and reflective questioning on the platform provides evidence of improving skills and confidence in blended learning. 
Over 80% of survey respondents felt that the course would improve their career prospects. 
The interviews with course participants and impact case studies show that BLE helps participants meet their CPD goals. They also demonstrate the positive impact of imparting knowledge acquired on BLE to others within participants' organisations. 
The interviews also demonstrate the potential for BLE to help teacher trainees improve their practice and meet their professional development goals in blended learning. 

Further funding
The success of these courses led to the team being invited to create two more, outside of the competitive funding process.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/blended-learning-getting-started/4</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Submission and invited witness to the Senate Enquiry into higher education financing reform, Australian Senate, Parliament House, Canberra, Bruce Chapman</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0DC4560-006E-4D32-BAB7-93F0C0B7C4EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Influenced Australian government policy re student loans/finance in Higher education</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>OFFA Financial Support Steering Group, Claire Callender</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F9CEFB91-E248-4AEC-AFDB-BA9EE06579DC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>OFFA Financial Support Steering Group is looking at the impact of student funding on student success.

Applied to the study of higher education and research, this enables us to more precisely identify the type of production and of good that is produced, and their limits and possibilities in each case.
