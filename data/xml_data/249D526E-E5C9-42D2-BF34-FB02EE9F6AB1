Industrial Network and Institutional Perspectives on Economic Growth and Well-being.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M008436/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Many urban regions in Europe have been hit hard by the economic crisis, but some regions have been more resilient than others. The question is why. Our project will investigate how European regions have responded to economic shocks, how successful they have been in developing new industries, and whether economic resilience goes hand in hand with higher social well-being. We employ a comprehensive approach to regional resilience in which history is key to understand how regions develop new growth paths. We will also investigate whether regions that are strongly linked with other regions through different kinds of networks are more resilient, and which institutions and policy approaches have proved more effective. These questions are investigated in quantitative comparative analyses of urban regions in the EU-27, and through a more in-depth analysis carried out for a few selected regions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many researchers have recently addressed the issue of regional resilience but there is still limited understanding of what the concept really encompasses, how it can be conceptualized, and how it can be operationalized and measured. Moreover, the concept consist of a number of dimensions (relatedness, institutions and networks) which have not yet been explored in the current literature on regional resilience. This project will give a major boost to the further development and refinement of the concept of regional resilience, and will increase our understanding of what makes regions resilient. 

Our research directly fuels the discussion on smart specialization, place based development and resilience as currently introduced by the EU (Barca et al 2012). The project also directly fuels the debate on the supposed trade-offs between smart growth and inclusive growth in European cities, and institutional influences on the resilience process and the possible effects of policy instruments. The impact of short-term and long-term economic change on the subjective well-being in European urban regions will also be addressed in detail. 

Special attention will be placed on the relevance of our outcomes for smart specialization strategies and, related to that, for 'smart governance'. Over the last couple of years, the role of smart specialisation has become central to economic development, innovation and growth policy-thinking in Europe (McCann and Ortega-Artiles 2011, Barca et al 2012). Smart specialisation has been highlighted by the European Commission as a central pillar of the Europe 2020 Strategy. In addition, clusters and specialization, value chain network positions, entrepreneurial opportunities, diversity and relatedness in skills and knowledge are hypothesized as crucial for local development opportunities and innovation: these are the issues we tackle in a unified analytical framework in our project. Regions will be required to identify the sectors, the technological domains, and the major arenas of likely competitive advantage, and focus their regional policies so as to promote and govern innovation in these fields (Thissen et al 2013). The strategy calls for large responsibilities of regional policymakers, public and private actors and institutions. Smart governance aims for effective collective problem-solving under conditions of high complexity and contextual uncertainty and volatility (Jessop 1998) - a situation that certainly is true in present day determinants of economic regional dynamics. 

Shorter life-cycles of products and industries, faster and more detailed (niche) entrepreneurial renewal, digitization, growing importance of crossovers between sectors, technology shifts, globalization of markets, open innovation structures, innovative funding opportunities and flexible labour markets are some of the characteristics of dynamic regional and urban economies ((Van Oort &amp;amp; Lambooy 2014). Despite established literatures on regional innovation systems, evolutionary branching of industries in regions, regional triple helix, and other economic geography perspectives on structural change and adaptability at the subnational levels, a focus on regional resilience and development from a hands-on governance, institutional and policy instruments perspective is still lacking.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298390</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Luisa Gagliardi former delegate in the 'Resilient Cities' project, now Assistant Professor at the School of Social Sciences, University of Geneva.
