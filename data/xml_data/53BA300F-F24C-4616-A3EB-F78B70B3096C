'Better Regulation' is the UK government's approach to developing regulation that achieves the desired outcome while avoiding unintended consequences and limiting costs for companies, consumers and the taxpayer. For Defra and the EA, the challenge is to improve, simplify, consolidate and even remove environmental regulations, while achieving at least equivalent outcomes for the environment, society and the economy. Academic research can offer useful guidance on how to tackle this challenge through providing evidence on the impacts, costs and benefits of various approaches to environmental regulation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Professor Bowen specialises in company responses to environmental regulation, and the fellowship will allow her to share her expertise with Defra, the EA and other government departments. During the fellowship Professor Bowen will&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&amp;nbsp;</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The primary beneficiaries of this project will be the sponsoring government agencies, Defra and the EA. The UK government's coalition agreement makes several specific commitments on regulatory reform intended to reduce the burden of regulation on the UK economy (HM Government, 2010). Defra is responsible for 400-500 groups of regulations that together impose direct annual costs to businesses of &amp;pound;4-8bn or around 0.4-0.9% of the UK's GDP (Defra, 2011). As part of the Cabinet Office's Red Tape Challenge, Defra has already begun the process of improving, simplifying, consolidating and even removing environmental regulations (Defra, 2012a), and is now continuing these efforts with the Smarter Environmental Regulation Review (Defra, 2012b). This project will support Defra and the EA by synthesising research evidence to support decision-making. It will help improve the environmental benefits of, and reduce unnecessary burdens of compliance to environmental regulation, thus contributing to sustainable growth in the UK.

The secondary beneficiaries of this project are two-fold: (1) other local and central government agencies that might learn from Defra/the EA's processes and approach and (2) companies and others that need to comply with the regulations. Complying with complex and often duplicated environmental regulations that have evolved piecemeal over time imposes unnecessary frustration and administrative burdens on companies and other enterprises. This project will contribute to decreasing this administrative burden for companies, estimated at &amp;pound;287m (Defra, 2011), decreasing the social cost of environmental protection.

Finally, the academic community will benefit from this project, not only in the direct sense of publishing a coherent synthesis of the research literature on voluntary environmental regulation, but more importantly through gaining understanding of how environmental regulation is implemented in practice. There is an active and engaged global communityf researchers studying firm responses to environmental regulation. But very few of these researchers have first-hand experience of working within a regulatory agency. The project offers a rare opportunity for the fellow to share insights on the regulatory process so that future academic research can be better informed of the practical and political possibilities of innovative regulatory approaches. The fellow could also share new expertise on the better regulation process, environmental regulation in practice and on evidence-based policymaking in courses such as QMUL's new Masters in Public Administration.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Audit Office</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Regulating and Influencing for Growth Community of Practice</gtr:description><gtr:id>B38DD60A-4EEC-452D-86D2-35ADCA5E0BC0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Multidisiplinary across social sciences, particularly economics, management accounting and regulation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The Community of Practice is hosted at the NAO.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This is a new collaboration that began during the fellowship when members of the 'Regulating and Influencing' cluster at the National Audit Office (NAO) became aware of the project.

Findings from each of these areas are currently being used by senior civil servants across several UK government departments and by the ESRC itself.

Objective 1: research findings on information-based regulation.

The Regulatory Policy Committee (RPC) at the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) plans to use some of the information-based regulation part of the project in training its economists and policy teams. During the project, Professor Bowen developed a 2x2 matrix identifying the types of information-based regulation, and new roles for regulators implied by each of these types. The RPC would like to develop good practice guidelines for Better Regulation teams across Whitehall, and has commissioned Professor Bowen to complete more work including a decision-making tool in this area. The refined findings will be used in training BR teams on regulatory alternatives later in 2015.

The information-based regulation 2x2 matrix has also been fed into the Cabinet Office's Horizon Scanning Programme on the Future of Regulation. The matrix was used at a Roundtable hosted by the Cabinet Office in September 2014 to facilitate analysis of the future of regulation across a wide variety of sectors beyond energy and the environment (e.g. regulating medical devices, small business, rental accommodation, trading standards). This programme of work is continuing at the Cabinet Office.

The Better Regulation team within Defra are using findings from the project to re-shape how they use twitter conversations and social networks to inform regulatory policy, especially on regulatory inspections and visits. Professor Bowen has worked with the team to change how they analyse, attempt to influence and learn from social network data around regulatory issues.

The Deregulation Bill has not yet completed its progress through parliament. However, when it does the Environment Agency plans to use some of the findings from the project to implement the new Growth Duty for Regulators.

Objective 2 - explore rationale for future research collaboration

The ESRC, Defra, Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), Environment Agency and Food Standards Agency have continued to develop relationships initiated during the project, and are developing a large-scale research initiative funded by the ESRC on Evaluating Policy in Complex Systems. This is expected to be launched in Spring 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A3CF46FA-9A9C-46BA-8D04-0DC89C9235B2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Environmental regulators in many countries face the challenge of maintaining high quality environmental protection and supporting their governments' economic growth policies. How can environmental regulatory policy both protect the natural environment and help drive the innovation and investment needed for longer-term economic growth? The ESRC, the UK's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Environment Agency (EA) jointly initiated this knowledge exchange project to explore environmental regulation and its effects on innovation, growth and business behaviours and the links between them, and investigate the scope for new approaches to regulation.

This project had two primary objectives, one focusing on research findings (objective 1), and one on capacity-building and knowledge exchange (objective 2):

Objective 1. To collate research evidence on which approaches to environmental regulatory policy would best support a sustainable economy, focusing on the relationships between environmental regulation, innovation, growth and firm performance.

Objective 2. To explore the rationale for future research collaboration on regulation for a sustainable economy and make appropriate recommendations on what form of future collaboration would be most valuable.

In order to achieve these objectives, Professor Frances Bowen conducted a 9-month policy placement at Defra. She was physically located with the Better Regulation Team at Defra that is responsible for delivering the UK government's commitments to streamline and simplify environmental regulations in the short term, and horizon scanning for broader regulatory reform in the long term.

Key Findings

Question 1: What does current research show about environmental regulation, innovation, growth and firm performance?

In order to answer this question, Professor Bowen conducted a systematic review of the literature on the relationships between environmental regulatory reform actions and economic growth. The review included not only academic literature, but also over 30 reports commissioned by Defra and other non-academic agencies on the actual and potential effects of regulation. The consensus view is that the impact of environmental regulation on growth depends on the regulatory design and the specific context. What this project adds to the literature is a sharper sense of which mechanisms link environmental regulation and growth, how and over what timescale.

Based on the review, Professor Bowen developed a framework including six mechanisms linking environmental regulatory reform with economic growth: infrastructure, investment in skills, innovation, inefficiency, information and integration ('the 6Is'). Mapping the growth mechanisms against specific regulatory instruments revealed some 'sweet spots' where sound evidence shows that specific environmental regulatory approaches may enhance business productivity, output, efficiency or lower costs. The review showed that using information-based regulation to drive changes in business behaviours has the potential to multiply positive links between environmental protection and economic growth. However, more research is needed on the unintended consequences of alternatives to traditional regulation such as industry self-regulation, certification or ranking schemes.

Question 2: How might the ESRC and environmental policy-makers collaborate to drive this agenda forward in the future?

On a strategic level, Professor Bowen held discussions with senior Defra and EA analysts on the importance of understanding dynamic business responses to environmental regulations, as well as their static net economic costs and benefits.

The rationale and form of several potential collaborative projects were discussed, particularly on information-based regulation and alternatives to traditional regulation. Some of these ideas have already been taken forward as part of other ESRC initiatives, such as within the ESRC's recent Sustainable Prosperity strategic steer in the 2014 large grants and centres call, and a proposed joint research initiative between Defra and other government departments on Evaluating Policy in Complex Systems. Professor Bowen also provided input into Defra's new Network Evidence Strategy (June 2014), which identifies smarter regulation as a Strategic Evidence Priority area to drive environmental innovation and business growth. Other suggested projects have so far not been taken forward due to the current public sector budgetary constraints.
Professor Bowen continues to collaborate with Defra's Better Regulation Team and the EA to link specific academics with policy teams as opportunities arise (e.g. hosted visits by Prof Neil Gunningham from Australia National University and Prof Tom Lyon from the University of Michigan).

On a more practical level, one of the most valuable aspects of the fellowship for Defra and the EA was that Professor Bowen was able to draw together a large body of research and relationships with others across Whitehall who were also interested in the relationships between business regulation, innovation and growth. The project helped build the long-term relationships needed to connect current and future civil servants with valuable past relationships and research, and to build a platform for a more ambitious research agenda in the future.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The primary use of this research in non-academic contexts is by government departments and regulatory agencies responsible for regulating and influencing behaviours. The research focused on firm responses to environmental regulation, but many of the insights may also be relevant to firm responses to a wide range of regulation such as behaviours relating to health and safety, rural development, housing, energy management, product labelling etc. Representatives of several government departments have expressed an interest in applying this research approach to their own work, including the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), and the National Audit Office (NAO).

The 6Is framework is already being put into use within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to communicate how the department can contribute to growth. As part of the project, Professor Bowen worked with Defra's Strategy Hub team to provide a sound evidence base and a conceptual framework for a 'Growth Roadshow'. The roadshow will provide staff development across Defra's policy teams on the connections between Defra's activities and growth. The Environment Agency is also interested in sharing the findings with its staff as it rolls out communications in response to new duties to have regard to growth in the Deregulation Bill that is currently under consideration in parliament.

More specifically, the project suggested several critiques and extensions to Better Regulation initiatives within Defra and across other government departments. These have been shared with teams within Defra, across Defra's regulatory delivery network, the Better Regulation Delivery Office (BRDO) and Better Regulation Executive (BRE), and the cross-whitehall group on the economics of regulation. During the project, Professor Bowen presented and gained feedback on the project from more than a dozen different groups in Whitehall and the Defra network, led three workshops on research methods and approaches, gave three keynote addresses to policy audiences, and met with over 60 individuals to discuss the project and its findings. This fellowship has laid the foundation for the ongoing relationships required to shape the conceptual foundations of more effective regulatory delivery in the future.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EAB9F3EF-E7D3-4BC8-B863-3F3FAEA3B55D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Defra's Smarter Environmental Regulation Review (SERR) and Better Regulation initiatives</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2D39FBF3-F9AA-4EEB-93A8-5438CCC39D85</gtr:id><gtr:impact>During the project, Professor Bowen was physically located for 2-3 days a week in the Better Regulation Team's office at Defra's HQ in Nobel House. She provided advice, guidance and supporting evidence for a range of ongoing initiatives within the BR Team. The project developed the evidence base for more concrete critiques and extensions to Phase 2 of the Smarter Environmental Regulation Review. Specifically, Phase 2 will (1) focus on user behaviours as well as perceptions; (2) adopt a more nuanced approach to when transparency-based regulation might work and (3) focus on integrating regulatory reform actions across regimes.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Future of Regulation Roundtable</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3F563F59-165A-4D07-AAB6-F8A2577E3C7D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I was invited to participate in a Cabinet Office Roundtable on the Future of Regulation as part of the Joint Intelligence Committee's Horizon Scanning Programme.

The full impact of this will not be clear unless and until the Deregulation Bill is passed (in 2015) and non-economic regulators begin to implement its provisions. The impact should be to develop practical tactics for regulatory agencies to be able to meet the dual goals of environmental protection and growth.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5BE5FAAB-E37E-4543-8441-E965BB97EE3A"><gtr:id>5BE5FAAB-E37E-4543-8441-E965BB97EE3A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Environmental regulatory reform and economic growth</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0ab6d37068b6dc28a700fdb814f38add"><gtr:id>0ab6d37068b6dc28a700fdb814f38add</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bowen, F.
