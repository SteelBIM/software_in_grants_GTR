hazards</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/N504361/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Tangible cultural heritage includes various categories of monuments and sites, from cultural landscapes and sacred sites to archaeological complexes, individual architectural or artistic monuments and historic urban centres.
Such places are continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external factors, both natural and human-induced, with rapid and/or slow onset, including natural hazards, such as earthquakes or extreme meteorological events, cumulative processes as well as the effects of humans, especially in conflict situations.
A clear picture of endangered sites is not available; UNESCO, WMF and ICOMOS are providing useful information but only on a limited portion of heritage. In particular, the list of List of World Heritage in danger in accordance with Article 11 of the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage mainly focuses on sites threaten by armed conflicts (e.g., Medieval monuments in Kosovo), or uncontrolled development (e.g., Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, and the Dresden Elbe valley, recently delisted from the UNESCO World Heritage).
New space technology based on radar interferometry (InSAR) is now capable to monitor, since 1992 and with mm precision, surface deformation for reflective targets named persistent scatterers, which consistently return stable signals to the radar satellites.
Led by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research, and in collaboration with NERC British Geological Survey, Geological and Mining Institute of Spain, University of Milano-Bicocca and Cyprus University of Technology, the project PROTHEGO will make an innovative contribution towards the analysis of geohazards in areas of cultural heritage in Europe.
The project will apply novel InSAR techniques to monitor monuments and sites that are potentially unstable due to landslides, sinkholes, settlement, subsidence, active tectonics as well as structural deformation, all of which could be effected of climate change and human interaction.
To magnify the impact of the project, the approach will be implemented in more than 450 sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List in geographical Europe.
After the remote sensing investigation, detailed geological interpretation, hazard analysis, local-scale monitoring, advanced modelling and field surveying for the most critical sites will be carried out to discover cause and extent of the observed motions.
Active engagement of stakeholders from both academic and heritage conservation sectors will be undertaken via establishment of the Steering Committee and Demonstration Site Stakeholders.
PROTHEGO will enhance Cultural Heritage management at National level, reinforcing institutional support and governance through knowledge and innovation, identifying, assessing and monitoring risks, strengthening disaster preparedness at heritage properties in the future.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>PROTHEGO will provide a new remote sensing tool and a new methodological approach, for the safety management of cultural heritage, at low cost and covering monuments and sites located in Europe.
The project will promote interdisciplinary and collaborative R&amp;amp;D activities, transferring the highest level of knowledge, quality and standards from space and earth sciences to cultural heritage conservation sciences.
The idea behind the project is to bring together the different actors in the field of protection of cultural heritage in risky areas (conservators, restorers, architects, archaeologists, engineers, geologists) through an approach that is as much as possible interdisciplinary, by defining a new paradigm of sustainable management and conservation that acts as a catalyst for economic growth of European countries.
The research methodology will be focused on: long term monitoring systems (with low impact); indirect analysis of environmental contexts, investigating changes and decay of structure, material and landscape.
The tools developed during the project (e.g. GIS platform, project web sites, European Hazards database assessment, Guidelines, best practices) will be useful to policy makers (public and private) in the field of cultural heritage to inform decision making based on the integrated risk assessment.
The outcomes of PROTHEGO will support correct planning and rebalancing the contrast between endogenous (structural and materials decay, the societal development, the anthropogenic pressure) and surrounding exogenous forces (natural hazards acting on the heritage) which affecting the European cultural heritage.
The project methodology will be designed to be easily exported and used by not only the research community, but also policy makers, businesses and commercial enterprises and practitioners from the heritage sector. New business opportunities will arise in relation to the sustainable management, exploitation and conservation of cultural heritage.
An example of potential impact is the collaboration of UNESCO within PROTHEGO. The Focal Point for Climate Change and Natural Hazard will join the Steering Committee and contribute to finalising project outputs with a view to their exploitation within the activities of UNESCO. More widely, the impact will be guaranteed by regular involvement and engagement of key Stakeholders from both academia and private and public heritage conservation and preservation sectors in the activities of the project. Stakeholders will be involved as part of the Steering Committee (Associate Partners directly involved in the implementation of the activities), Stakeholders' Group (public and private sector Associate Partners primarily interested in the exploitation of the methodologies and outputs of the project) and Demonstration Site Stakeholders (a subset of the Stakeholders' Group, playing crucial role for the calibration of the methodology to site specific scale for the four demonstration sites).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>156167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>PROTHEGO's logo is the primary visual representation of the project.

The website is the main point of reference for PROTHEGO's external communication.
NERC is responsible for PROTHEGO's website design, maintenance and hosting during and beyond the duration of the project, and started its design in October 2015.
Main components of the website and their content were prepared and incorporated in the website RWD template by NERC in November and December 2015, and include:
? Main top banner: blending PROTHEGO's project logo with the image of one of the demonstration sites;
? Footer: including the 5 Project Partners logos, Disclaimer, Contact us, Privacy, Terms of use and links to email PROTHEGO's WP7 Leader (F. Cigna, NERC) and Webmaster (G. Nash, NERC);
? Main menu: including links to the different pages (Home, Project, News, Partners);
? Home: welcome to the project website, full project title, general information about the funding call and high-level objectives of PROTHEGO;
? Project: with a description of the project objectives, methodology and final goals.
? News: a regularly updated page collecting brief news with key events and achievements of the project, with photographs and links to download agendas, posters and documents, when applicable;
? Partners: a page with the 5 Project Partners names, short presentations, key contact details and links to respective institutional websites, and their roles and responsibilities within the project;
? Boxes: a set of small windows that appear in every page and include information on: (i) Funding: logos of the JPI-CH, and national funding bodies (MIBACT, MIUR, AHRC, RPF and MINECO); (ii) News: brief news sorted by date, linking to their full versions in the News page; and (iii) Useful links: an initial set of links to UNESCO World Heritage List, JPI Cultural Heritage and Heritage Portal.

Further content and pages in the website will be added regularly on a weekly to monthly basis as the project develops. These include, for instance: (i) the full list and respective logos and links to the Associate Partners institutions in a dedicated page, (ii) 'Find a cultural heritage' map embedded into the website to display PROTHEGO's GIS database products, (iii) Demonstration sites page with short overviews with indication of geohazards and summary of project results, and (iv) access to 'Online Survey Forms' for User Consultation at M7-8.
Within a Downloads page, the website will also hold project deliverables (reports and GIS databases) and publications that have public (PU) dissemination level, whereas project deliverables with restricted (PP) dissemination level will be held on the password-protected file sharing platform for internal use of the Project Partners and visitor access for the JPI-CH Heritage Plus Coordinator.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.prothego.eu/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Derwent Catchment Partnership Annual Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B05FB7DF-4C98-46C2-991B-A98CA8BC4A2A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>63 members of the Partnership attended the Annual Meeting on 28 January 2016, including A Harrison (NERC/BGS) who made local stakeholders aware of PROTHEGO and gather their feedback on the project methodologies, data and results.

It aimed to inform the stakeholders about the project and to ensure their views, requirements and needs were captured to guide the project WPs. This was crucial for the activities that will form part of the analysis of geohazards at European scale in WP3 and WP4, and local scale monitoring and modelling of the demonstration sites in WP5 and WP6.
The first User Consultation Workshop During the workshop the project was presented to the Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (MIBACT), Steering Committee members from the European Space Agency (ESA) and EO Expert Group of EuroGeoSurveys (EGS), and Stakeholders of the Institute for Conservation and Restoration (ISCR), Superintendence Capitolina and Cyprus Remote Sensing Society (CRSS). The Italian Space Agency (ASI), the Superintendence of Pompeii, Ercolano and Stabia and teams from the European Videor and JPI-CH CLIMA projects also participated in the round-table discussion on the use of InSAR for cultural heritage management.
The workshop allowed PROTHEGO's consortium to raise the stakeholder awareness regarding the objectives and methodology of the project and to encourage them to participate actively in the design of the European and local scale analyses that PROTHEGO will undertake in WP3 to WP6.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.isprambiente.gov.it/files/eventi/eventi-2015/workshop-prothego/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>stakeholder meetings</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>482034F2-6CDD-4213-8B74-B57072C96FE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>meeting with 2 main stakeholders intereseted in developing, influencing and using the research into flood risk analsysis. the meeting's aim was to capture the stakeholder's specific and generic industry needs to ensure that the reseach and development is strongly aligned with business needs. the meeting sucessfully estbalished these needs and helped to prioritise case study focus.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015,2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>European Geo-Surveys - Earth Observation Expert Group Annual Meeting</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15A23019-F0CE-4D96-905C-FA01E981B304</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Update of the PROTHEGO Project preliminary results (geohazard distribution vs cultural heritage at European scale) of interest for EGS-EOEG community</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>online presentations</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B55CDF61-E72F-4D18-A87A-B04890964836</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project website (www.prothego.eu): dedicated website for the project, including information on the project objectives, methodologies and goals, as well as the funding call, project partners, principal investigators and their role within the project
