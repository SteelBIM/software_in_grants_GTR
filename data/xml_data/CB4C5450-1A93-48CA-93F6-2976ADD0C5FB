The proposed study is anchored within the third of the overarching questions of this call, and aimed at understanding the conditions under which education interventions focused on teachers can promote peace, and mitigate and reduce violence with a view to identifying measures and processes that can increase the effectiveness of such programmes in conflict-affected situations. The research seeks to critically evaluate a series of programme interventions aimed at improving and enhancing the peacebuilding role of teachers through a multi-scalar, mixed method study that seeks to link the everyday practices of teachers in conflict affected contexts with the local, national and global actors and factors that shape their practices and behaviour. 

South Africa and Rwanda have been selected because both countries have emerged peacefully out of intense and violent conflict in the 1990s and now have two decades of postconflict experience to draw from. Secondly, they have been important sites for a range of postconflict interventions in the education sector, and in particular on teacher related interventions. Thirdly, they allow for a comparison of similar interventions across two countries which have since 1994 has put in place important policy interventions to promote peace and social cohesion which warrant close scrutiny. Fourthly, both countries enable examination of the complex interrelationship between inequality and peace and social cohesion in education. 


The overarching aim of the study is to identify elements of education policy interventions that have enabled teachers to become active agents of peacebuilding in postconflict countries and that may inform future interventions. These objectives will be achieved through an empirically grounded evaluation of the nature, implementation, and impact of large-scale interventions that are designed to support teachers as peace-builders in schools in postconflict contexts. We will look at specifically at interventions focusing on teachers, found in both South Africa and Rwanda, including interventions related to 1) Teacher training 2) Teacher recruitment, deployment and management 3) Teacher performance and practices 4) Curriculum and textbook reform. 

Research will include a political economy analysis of the context of these interventions in each country in order to critically embed the research in the local context, and will draw upon a realist evaluation approach (Pawson, 2005) which seeks to understand the underpinning programme theory of each of the interventions, as well as the challenges and outcomes. 
Research will also include a global mapping of peacebuilding interventions aimed at teachers, interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders in each country, and detailed classroom observations in three key sites in each country. 

The research is linked to, and supported by, a UNICEF 4 year $160 million Education, Peacebuilding and Advocacy Programme (2012-2016), which will ensure its relevance, influence and impact in practitioner, policy and academic domains.

It will feed into debates related to the role of education in peacebuilding with the opportunity to both improve the quality of UNICEF 's and international agencies' peacebuilding and education programmes and to influence a broader United Nations debate on education's place in postconflict peacebuilding interventions.

The research team comprises an internationally diverse and interdisciplinary team of experts from the UK, South Africa, and Rwanda with expertise in teacher education, peacebuilding and conflict studies. The research team will work closely with UNICEF in order to maximise, local, national and global impact and build knowledge and capacity in this important field</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project aims for societal impact, through generating and communicating new knowledge in postconflict contexts on:
(i) how teachers can be enabled to reduce violence and build peace in schools; and 
(ii) how education contributes to positive peace in wider society.

Its impact on economic growth is indirect. Teachers are key to improving learning outcomes of school students. Preparing young people to pursue peacebuilding and sustainable livelihoods is a necessary condition for economic growth.

The main beneficiaries of the project are learners and teachers in contexts where the findings are taken up, leading to changed behaviours and professional practices that reduce violence and build peace in schools. Improving the school environment and processes for learners supports improved learning outcomes in relation to skills associated with peacebuilding but also across the whole curriculum. This means children and young people are better prepared to lead sustainable livelihoods, reducing poverty and widening the skill base available to support economic growth.

Impacts on beneficiaries:
(i) Teachers and learners in postconflict contexts, where findings are taken up will benefit from improved design of education initiatives that build positive peace and reduce violence in schools, and raise learning outcomes, better preparing learners for sustainable livelihoods.
(ii) National policy makers and education officials and staff of international agencies in South Africa and Rwanda will acquire new knowledge on impact of peacebuilding of education programmes and contextualised advice on programme design. They will expand capacity to take up new knowledge from education research as research design and findings are shared through the project lifespan.
(iii) Grassroots stakeholders groups such as local NGOs, teacher unions, parents associations and civil society organisations involved in education, will benefit from access to project findings and expanded capacity to take up findings from research through involvement in research design and research briefings. 
(iv) International agencies, such as DfID, UNICEF and IRC, who invest in, design or implement education programmes in postconflict contexts, and policy makers in ministries of education will benefit from guidance on programme design derived from systematic evaluation of selected initiatives across two country contexts.
(v) Academics and researchers will benefit from new knowledge and understanding of the role of teachers in peacebuilding, adding to the limited evidence base.

Impact legacy will be achieved within the two study countries through a series of consultation and research briefing meetings together with ongoing email and telephone contact with key staff. Consultation in phase one will be integrated with interviews with 'policy elites' and will feed into research design, so that research meets knowledge needs of specific peace education initiatives. Ensuring the research is relevant to programme objectives and organisational priorities will build a sense of research ownership and commitment to implementing findings amongst our partners.

International impact will be achieved through engagement with staff in the head offices of international agencies, such as UNESCO, and ensuring that findings are related to their current priorities. We will reach international agency staff through participation in the conferences they usually attend, through one-to-one meetings and email contact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>347963</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>UNESCO International Task Force for Teachers for EFA</gtr:description><gtr:id>04A961C3-1461-4A5F-B5CC-237EB6F44C6E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Current collaboration includes a global teacher education report for 2016 due end of 2016.

'The Role of Education in Peacebuilding - Foundations, Findings and Futures' in April, 2016 organized by the Research Consortium on Education and Peacebuilding, a partnership between UNICEF and the University of Amsterdam, the University of Sussex, Ulster University. The event brought together research partners from South Africa, Pakistan, Myanmar and Uganda along with the three Consortium universities: Sussex, Ulster and Amsterdam. The event was attended by over 100 academics, researchers, students, practitioners and policy makers, important donor agencies (e.g. German and Dutch Aid Agencies), multilateral organisations (e.g. UNESCO, UNICEF), International NGOs (e.g.Save the Children,OxfamNovib), research and policy organisations (e.g. PEIC-Protect education in insecurity and conflict, Qatar, American Institute for Peace). 
At this dissemination workshop, the research team members had presented on the research finding of the four-country synthesis report on the role of teachers in promoting sustainable peacebuilding. Prof Mario Novelli's presentation titled ' the Consortium's Contribution to Education and Peacebuilding: The 4Rs Framework, Research Approach &amp;amp; Framing' outlined the overview of the research process and research framework. In her presentation titled 'The Role of Teachers in Peacebuilding and Social Cohesion', Dr. Naureen Durrani (University of Sussex) discussed the role of teachers in education and peacebuilding. Dr. Azeem Badroodien's (the Centre for International Teacher Education (CITE) at CPUT) presentation 'Critical research insights from South Africa on social cohesion' focussed on the research finding in the case of South Africa. In their poster presentation, Marcina Singh and Lorna Balie (Centre for International Teacher Education, Faculty of Education, CPUT) discussed the South African case study, which looked at the role of formal and non-formal &amp;quot;socially cohesion&amp;quot; initiatives around youth agency for peacebuilding.

In South Africa members of the team have engaged in workshops with the Institute of Justice and Reconciliation, and in training sessions with principals run by the organisation Shikaya in 2015. 

The Rwanda and South Africa teams have also hosted workshops and dialogic fora around the cross cutting issues of violence and gender with a a wide range of practitioners, policy-makers and NGO representatives.

Research capacity building has been a key component of this project. This includes the participation of 3 postgraduates students in South Africa in the research whose theses has focused on teachers as agents of peace and social cohesion, supporting junior academic staff in Rwanda to engage them in the research as assistants to more senior colleagues, and hosting seminars on the research approach and methodology of the study for PG students in Rwanda and in South Africa at the University of Rwanda and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology respectively.

Public lectures around issues of teachers and social cohesion in Rwanda and South Africa in in 2015 and 2016 served to bring together together students academics, but also activists, teachers and government representatives as well as civil society representatives.

Two interviews were given in 2015 on radio shows on community radio, alongside a press statement on the education budget and various articles in print media in both Rwanda and South Africa.


Social media accounts were created in both Rwanda and South Africa to link with and map national and international stakeholders working on education and peace building. we have also leveraged the twitter hashtag, #pbearesearch to produce regular twitter messages across time zones. 

The Research has resulted in the following working papers and popular media outputs which are available online:

o 3 newsletters, (2 general, 1 dedicated to Youth Literature Review dissemination) 
o 6 blogs
o 1 Literature Review on teachers as agents of peace (with complementary 3 and 1 page summaries) 
o 1 paper outlining the Theoretical and Methodological Framework of the research. 

As noted in the publications section, there has been several academic outputs such as journal articles and chapters in books.
This research has multi-dimensional and multi-scalar impact in academia and beyond. This research allowed us to build collaborations and connections not only with academia and non-academics. We have involved in consultations and dialogue with policy makers, practitioners, government official, civil society organizations, international organizations, NGOs, teachers and teacher unions. 

Both in Rwanda and South Africa we have organized and hosted various workshops, forums and seminars on education and teachers. In Rwanda, the team attended events that are organized by Aegis Trust on Peace and Value Education and Catholic Church as well as organising policy workshops. In South Africa, the team engaged and participated in in workshops with various actors. Our extensive public engagement list shows the extent of these events. The research has also brought teachers to the fore arguing the important potential positive role they can play in peace and social cohesion. We have emphasised the need for their agency and participation in educational reform and policies for a sustainable peace process and social cohesion in society. During our interviews and our visits to local schools both in Rwanda and South Africa teacher were positive about their role and showed their willingness to be part in a societal change. 
Similarly, we hosted and participated in events in Europe and in the UK to collaborate with wider participants beyond academia. We have given Keynote speeches/presentations at international events where diverse participants attended to debate and discuss education and conflict and teachers and peace. These events were organised by World Bank, Open Society, USAID and Research Consortium dissemination event, at UNICEF as well as conferences that were organized by regional institutions and governments for instance the South Asia Regional Symposium on Sustainable Peace and Education in Sri Lanka.
Research capacity building has been one of the key components of this project. In South Africa, three postgraduate students whose work has focussed teachers as agents of peace and social change participated in the research project. We have supported them throughout and one of them completed their study successfully, while the remaining are close completion. In Rwanda, the research we provided support to junior staff who have come to engage actively in the research as research assistant. As part of the capacity building we have organized a number of seminars on topics related to research topics, its framework and methodology for postgraduate student as well as junior staff both at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (South Africa) and at the University of Rwanda (Rwanda). Furthermore we have supported and encourage them in presenting their work at national and international conferences. 

As it is evident from our engagement activities, as research team we have involved in organization of events in the forms of workshop, forum, seminar on teachers and social cohesion to bring together academia (academics, students and researchers) with policy makers, government officials, civil society representatives, teachers and activists that are working on similar issue. For instance, Critical Reference Groups workshops in both Rwanda and South Africa, Shikaya Workshop: Facing Ourselves and Facing the Past in July, 2016, Colloquium on Teachers and Social Cohesion, and seminars at Sussex can be seen some of the example of this work. All these events have facilitated engagements with all these diverse actors and allowed them to engage in a conversation and dialog for future collaborations. 


In addition to these events, we have put a great effort to reach out and engage with wider audiences beyond academia to share our research findings. For this we have used multiple sources. Social media accounts were created in both Rwanda and South Africa to link with and map national and international stakeholders working on education and peace building. we have also leveraged the twitter hashtag, #pbearesearch to produce regular twitter messages across time zones. We have given interviews on radio shows on community radio, and produced several media articles on social cohesion addressing contemporary topical debates for instance three published articles in the Conversation newspaper by Professor Sayed, which were shared more than 100 times both on Twitter and Facebook by wider audiences, and read several thousand times can be a great example of this effort. 


As also evident from our extensive publications lists that as a result of this research, the team members have come to produce a significant knowledge. This knowledge has been channelled through book chapters, working papers, journal articles, media outputs, newsletter articles, blogs on various aspect of the research including methodological and theoretical framework. The research team members involved in editing a special issue (titled: Teachers and Social Cohesion in the global South: Expanding the notion of education quality') of journal 'Education as Social Change which contains articles contribution from the research teams.
