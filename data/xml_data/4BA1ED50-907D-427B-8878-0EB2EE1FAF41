But, man-made nanoparticles (i.e. engineered nanoparticles or ENPs) are of tremendous technological and economic interest. They have a wide range of potential applications in environmental remediation, medical and consumer products. The small sizes of ENPs give them special chemical properties, making them potentially reactive. These particles are being discharged, voluntary or involuntary, into the environment in common with other pollutants such as those present in diesel exhaust, oil leaks and spills, tobacco smokes. These chemicals are collectively known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and they have known detrimental effects on the health of humans and the natural biota, including induction of cancer. 

The reactive property of ENPs can potentially cause harm to humans and other life forms and in the environment, they can occur in all probable combinations with other pollutants such as PAHs. They can interact and behave in different ways, opposed to when they are present on their own in the environment. Their potential interactive effects are however unknown. Within the cells (the smallest unit of life), they can cause damage to biomolecules (e.g. membranes, proteins and DNA). In addition to direct interaction of ENPs and PAHs with biomolecules (e.g. DNA, cell membrane), the resultant damage could be through the formation of highly reactive molecules called free radicals which are involved in many pathological conditions, which we aim to measure using specific technique, the methodologies for which have not been properly developed. This is particularly so in cases where they are brought into contact with water under different conditions (e.g. salinity, acidity, oxygen level etc.) either alone or in combinations with other pollutants such as PAHs. 

We will be synthesise ENPs in our laboratory and will characterise them for their specific properties in various conditions, track their uptake by the mussels (alone or in combination with PAHs) and localise them in different tissues using analytical techniques where appropriate. Using two chemically different, widely used, environmentally relevant ENPs (i.e. C60 fullerenes and carbon nanotubes), the aim of the present proposal is to determine the potential effects of these ENPs either alone or in combinations with environmentally relevant PAHs. We will be using a range of biological measures, which will include damage to DNA or genes, the blueprint of life, and determine how either the single or group of genes behave in different conditions, which could lead to potential detrimental effects in different organs or tissues of marine mussels. We will vary the extent of damage produced, by altering the exposure conditions (chronically or acute) and will also determine the antioxidants levels to correlate the effects. The damaging effect of generated radicals on cell membranes will also be examined. We will use modelling techniques to incorporate individual biological responses to draw a bigger picture of potential effects. Using analytical techniques, we will determine the levels of ENPs and PAHs in seawater and the tissues of the organism and will correlate these levels with observed effects. Such an approach will help us to determine the potential risk to our health from these chemicals and will inform the regulators and the industries to take appropriate actions to safeguard the health of humans and the environment. 
We will use the generated information to explain the pathways of exposure to ENPs and PAHs and suggest ways to reduce any potential harm. This may also have application in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. We will share the information with the scientific community, industries, and all other stake holders.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Research on the potential for detrimental effects with environmental safety implications of engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) has a global impact across both government and industry. In addition, it also has an important impact on the public understanding of the benefits of these new technologies, as the nanoparticles will enter the environment through various sources. 

The proposed research will facilitate critical evaluation of the internationally agreed process for the evaluation of potential effects and toxicity testing to determine whether the current legislative test methods are fit for purpose and are acceptable to industry. The proposal will also identify the opportunities, nationally and internationally, for research priorities to advance the interdisciplinary science and influence governmental policies and international initiatives (through e.g. OECD, ISO, EU, US EPA) to determine safe levels of exposures either for environmental or for work place exposures through different routes. The results generated in this proposal will serve as a spring board to elucidate potential interactive toxic effects along with providing critical bioavailability/uptake mechanisms and potential effects at different levels of biological organisation (molecular to individual levels), to afford the opportunity to consider which level is best to select for hazard and risk identification. 

The combined effects of contaminants have been a burning issue in both scientific and regulatory communities to understand the mechanisms of actions at biological levels and to protect both our and environmental health. In a broader perspective, the proposal will help to elucidate the fundamental understanding to fill the knowledge gaps towards building a consensus approach to assess the potential biological effects of ENPs, either alone or in combination with other ubiquitous contaminants/ pollutants such as carcinogenic PAHs. 

This interdisciplinary study will have an effective impact on the academic community who aim to elucidate a fundamental understanding of anthropogenic chemicals with living systems especially relating to the application of newly emerging technologies. The information could be translated to other biological systems including humans, given that a large number of genes involved in the processing of stress related response are evolutionary and are highly conserved. 

The results generated could also benefit those industries aiming to develop products in areas such as photodynamic therapy and nano-medicine. The protocols developed to estimate the free radical generation could benefit those industries which are interested in sun protection, polymorphic light eruption and other UV sensitivities. Members of the project team are involved in synthesis of novel nanomaterials and uses of purpose-made nano-materials could further explore their applications in other areas (e.g. water treatment, development of photovoltaic cells). The project will also impact on advancement of analytical capabilities to determine levels of contaminants in biological matrices. The deliverables of the project will also impact on the public awareness for new technologies and impact the younger generation to opt for scientific careers to progress our future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>567041</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The mussels' perspective' film installation.

The outcomes will also be of benefit to environmental managers and regulators and affords the potential to initiate new collaborations in an effort to improve our existing knowledge in this important field of research. Distinguished scientists, regulators and representatives from industries have confirmed their participation and will be giving presentations during the symposium. In addition to experienced and senior scientists, young scientists are also encouraged to actively participate and present their work in this symposium.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/whats-on/current-trends-in-nanotoxicology</gtr:url><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>6050</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>International Symposium in Nanotoxicology, 1-2 June 2017 Plymouth, UK</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-06-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>United Kingdom Environmental Mutagen Society (UKEMS)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>7244AFC8-4E84-4D8C-B07C-E908537E65AA</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The work has been presented in public meetings and international conferences which was attended by different stakeholders (e.g. regulators, NGOs, Govt. organisations and other industries). Preliminary results have been presented to policy makers (e.g. Defra and EA) and other stake-holders in a workshop organised by Defra at Birmingham University (24 February 2016). The results of this project will benefit scientists working to elucidate both the potential beneficial and detrimental impacts of ENPs affording important information to industries trying to harness this technology. This will also be of benefit to environmental managers and regulators.

The research outcomes could also help the cosmetic industries, who aim to seek new techniques to further improve their ranges of healthcare and beauty products and develop the safe and effective use of ENPs for sun protection, polymorphic light eruption and other UV sensitivities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>EE5AD21C-46CB-4A4A-A6B3-5D0345FA39A8</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. Preliminary data indicates that co-exposure of mussels to carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) does alter uptake and effects 
2. Mussels can alter the aggregation behaviour of nanomaterials in seawater.
3. Benzo(a)pyrene causes a concentration-dependent genotoxic response in in vitro mussel digestive gland culture, but MWNT does not produce this response under the same conditions.
4. For the first time, a role of mTOR was identified in mussel digestive gland after in vivo exposure to benzo(a)pyrene. The evaluation of its activity will contribute to clarifying the cellular responses to this and other PAHs in future.
5. During co-exposure, the presence of MNWT decreases the uptake of benzo(a)pyrene into mussel digestive gland, and correspondingly more benzo(a)pyrene remains in aqueous concentration.
6. During co-exposure, the presence of MWNT decreases the genotoxic effects of benzo(a)pyrene, eliminating the concentration-dependence.
7. Labelling MWNTs with gold changes their aggregation behaviour in seawater (form smaller aggregates).
8. Gold labelled MWNTs are taken up into mussel tissues, particularly the digestive gland and can be detected by ICP-MS and EM technologies.
9. A new DNA microarray was developed. This microarray contains about 600 probes suitable for following the changes in the transcriptomic activities of mussels in response to the effects of toxic chemicals. It is a powerful but low cost tool.
10. A new immunohistochemical method to follow the presence and distribution of PAHs in mussel cells was realized and will be verified using conventional techniques.
11. Carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) experiments: Carbon nanotubes have been successfully labelled with gold using the nanotube cavity as a compartment for metal nanoparticles. TEM imaging of digestive gland cross sections has enabled real space imaging of the synergistic impact of BaP and carbon nanotubes on the ultrastructure of muscle digestive gland.
The presence of MWNTs reduces the uptake of BaP and reduces genotoxic effects (the opposite to Trojan horse enhancement). The same observations have been made under in vitro exposure conditions.
Microarray results clearly showed an opposite trend of gene expression between the BaP exposure alone and the co-exposure BaP-MWNT, with specific processes affected.
12. Fullerenes (C60) and Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) experiments: Fullerene (C80) labelled internally with rare metal (Er) has been manufactured by Designer Carbon Materials Ltd.
Er3N@C80s are taken up into the tissues/cells of mussels. Fullerene labelled with erbium has been successfully detected within the digestive gland by ICP-MS and by using dark-field TEM imaging techniques and its presence has confirmed by EDX.
Preliminary data indicates that different effects are observed after co-exposure to BaP and C60 compared to MWNT. The presence of C60 does not reduce the uptake of BaP, and does not reduce genotoxicity.
C60s photo-oxidise in the environment. We have identified some products. This has implications for the fate, uptake and toxicity of C60s.C60s have been quantified in atmospheric particulates in London. Sources have been shown to include diesel exhaust and jet engine emissions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our data on the aggregation behaviour of MWNT with and without the experimental animal (in this case mussels) has wide-ranging implications for the design of characterisation within eco-nanotoxicology experiments.

Once further characterised, gold labelled MWNT may be useful to track these otherwise difficult to visualise nanomaterials in biological samples. This technique could therefore have use in a wide range of eco-nanotoxicology applications.
The DNA microarray may be used in the field to follow the biological effects of environmental changes at the transcriptomic level. The MED POL programme has planned a transcriptomic field biomonitoring activity using this new powerful tool. The microarray will be easily used by researchers involved in ecotoxicological studies on marine mussels.

The discovery of the role of mTOR may have wide-ranging applications in further ecotoxicological research at molecular and cellular levels.

The immuno-histochemical detection of PAHs, dioxins and PCBs will open a new field of activities on the detection and tissue distribution of these dangerous toxic chemicals.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>02379084-47BC-45B4-AA0C-B844C6FB0C2C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Environment,Healthcare,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/research/genetic-ecotoxicology/trojan-horses</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Preliminary cellular physiological interaction network models have been constructed using CYTOSCAPE.

Validation of this new technology is already achieved in laboratory exposed and mussels collected from field. 
New immunohistochemical methods using specific antibodies have been developed to study the accumulation and the distribution of B[a]P and C60 in mussel tissues. Changes in actin/tubulin cytoskeleton were also analysed. The role of mTOR in the regulation of the autophagic process stimulated by environmental contaminants was demonstrated and proposed as new biomarker of stress.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA2265B1-575E-494D-838D-6E9FB5AAF2E5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This new platform is now considered as robust and reliable transcriptomic tool for the analysis of mussel's gene expression regulation. The platform could be further implemented with new identified molecular targets in mussels. Moreover, the new platform can be used for routine biomonitoring analysis thus offering a rapid and relatively low cost tool.

The use of an immunohistochemical approach will allow identifying minimal amount of PAHs and fullerene in the tissues of molluscs and other organisms. mTOR was found a valuable stress biomarker also in field biomonitoring and therefore it should be used in the future as a powerful indicator of the effects of environmental contaminants on mussel physiology. mTOR results will help to realise new studies on the autophagic process and more in general on the control of the physiological status of the molluscs.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>NERC project on nanoparticles: Microarray, Immunohistochemistry and new biomarkers in Mussels</gtr:title><gtr:type>Model of mechanisms or symptoms - non-mammalian in vivo</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>To afford 'in-house' analyses of environmental C60s and their degradation products, in collaboration with other projects, an atmospheric pressure photo-ionization (APPI) source has been acquired for installation onto our orbitrap HPLC-MS.

An important progress in the methodology of electron microscopy imaging has been made by developing a protocol for imaging unstained cross sections of digestive gland deposited on a graphene oxide substrate. The absence of staining metal allows improved TEM imaging and spectroscopic detection (by the energy dispersive X-ray analysis, EDX) of nanotubes labelled with Au on the single-particle level within the cells, and graphene oxide protects the delicate tissue from radiation damage of the electron beam during the analysis. Furthermore, this method has revealed a surprising occurrence of copper nanoparticles embedded in the digestive gland which is an unexpected result with potentially important implications for future.
Finally, fullerene labelled with erbium has been successfully detected within the digestive gland using dark-field TEM imaging techniques, and its presence has confirmed by EDX.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Improvement of EM technologies</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>High-throughput LC-MS/MS will be applied to compare the proteomic responses of the mussel digestive glands exposed to BaP and C60 alone and in combination.
