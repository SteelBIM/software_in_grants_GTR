Feminist analyses have shown that motherhood is best treated as an interdisciplinary field, and autobiographical and fictional writing by women offer distinctive perspectives, but, although literature specialists draw on work from a range of disciplines, the reverse is rare. The Motherhood in post-1968 European Literature Network aims to change this situation by initiating, in a specifically European context, cross-cultural, transnational and interdisciplinary dialogue on motherhood, in which the study of literature is integrated. It will bring together researchers engaged in studying motherhood in individual contemporary European literatures with researchers and practitioners working on motherhood from philosophy, psychoanalysis, sociology, ethnography, politics and law as well as art and film studies. By means of a series of workshops, online resources and activities, readings, and a major conference and exhibition, the Network will explore how representations and narratives of motherhood in contemporary women-authored literatures engage with current socio-political, psychological and legal discourses. The Network will generate an edited book publication, as well as ongoing online resources and other forms of knowledge transfer dissemination, such as an anthology of literature, media activity, and social networking. The ultimate aims of the Network are: 1. to contribute the as-yet-absent insights drawn from literary studies to policy studies of motherhood in the EU; 2. to lead to a better understanding of the relationship between literature and society; 3. to develop a major pan-European cross-disciplinary funding application.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The Network itself aims to explore and elucidate the social impact of studying literary treatments of motherhood and so, at this stage, the impact summary can only be partial. Potential non-academic beneficiaries of the Network are:\n\na. Policy-makers - organisations and institutions, e.g: \n- Family Platform, consortium of 12 organisations (inc. social scientists, policy-makers, social organisations) working on family life and policy across Europe, and providing input into the EU's socio-economic and humanities research agenda on Family Research and Family Policies;\n- Eurofund, an EU foundation for the improvement of living and working conditions in relation to specific areas of EU policy;\n- Institute for Family Policy, which develops synergies between family organisations internationally to increase awareness of policy and decision makers on family issues;\n- European Economic and Social Committee, an integral part of the EU's decision-making process;\n- Members of the European Parliament, including Baroness Sarah Ludford, Liberal Democrat MEP for London, spokeswoman for European justice and human rights, and active on anti-racism, sexuality, and diversity, including recognising diversity in families.\n\nb. Charities, e.g.:\n- The Family and Parenting Institute, a charity that aims to influence family policy and to make society more family friendly;\n- Family Action, which supports disadvantaged and socially isolated families;\n- National Childbirth Trust, which supports people through life-changing experiences of pregnancy, birth and early parenthood;\n- Parenting UK, which supports professional practitioners working with parents and informs policy makers.\n\nc. Practitioners, e.g.:\n- those working with mothers and families: social workers, psychologists, psychoanalysts, health workers, activists, etc;\n- school and college teachers;\n- community groups, e.g. Mumsnet online community and campaigning group; \n- cultural practitioners: authors, artists, filmmakers, photographers, etc.\n- reading groups;\n- creative writing groups.\n\nd. General public\n\nLiterature is much more than a partial reflection of reality. It can open up new ways of thinking. Literary narratives and representations of motherhood - whether autobiographical or fictional (or varying degrees in between) - offer access to inner fears and fantasies, those of mothers themselves or those concerning them. Literary techniques offer ways of expressing intimate feelings and experiences, which may otherwise be inexpressible. For example, metaphor and fantasy may convey in a new way what it feels like to be pregnant, to give birth, or (as Trauma Studies have shown) to lose a child, or even to kill one. Literature can stimulate thinking; it may challenge or subvert normative discourse. It reflects upon issues of the day and it can provoke new ways of thinking about everyday problems. The kinds of insight gained from the study of literary representations and narratives of motherhood have the potential to inform understandings of motherhood and maternal subjectivity. It is anticipated that the work will be of interest to family and cultural practitioners, as well as to the general public. \nThe social impact and knowledge transfer agenda of the Network will be facilitated through non-academic forms of dissemination (as described in detail in the Pathways to Impact attachment), including an exhibition, a virtual reading group, an anthology of literature, media interviews, social network groups and blogs. Ultimately, the aim is to constitute and establish the Network, to develop its sphere of influence, and to refine its methodologies in order to apply for funding for a broader-based and more ambitious pan-European project, designed to impact on social policy and to improve ways in which societies think about motherhood and governments legislate for - rather than ag</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36032</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A film on motherhood and disability reflecting non-linear neuro-atypical brains' organisation of information</gtr:description><gtr:id>BE457A11-B914-4C3E-82EB-1B3BEB00CD21</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Audience engaged with issues around motherhood and disability</gtr:impact><gtr:title>A Hero Ain't Nothin' But a Sandwich</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.shelleyrae.net/videos/a_hero.html</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An online, interactive, interdisciplinary arts project containing art and texts relating to the maternal.</gtr:description><gtr:id>EC699DDC-3721-450D-B725-5017B1E329C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Audience engaged with various aspects of motherhood</gtr:impact><gtr:title>The Egg, the Womb, the Head and the Moon</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.eggwombheadmoon.com/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Interactive photographic and text-based installation relating to women who, for various reasons, do not have children.

(i) Methodology and Process



a. The substantial membership of the Network mailing list, built up over a relatively short period, indicates the importance and interest that the topic has in a pan-European context, at a time when Europe is being reconfigured by migration, economic changes, the effects of new reproductive and communication technologies and in relation to family patterns and policies.



b. The events, activities and on-line resources of the Network produced a stimulating space and atmosphere which facilitated international individual and institutional links between researchers and between researchers and cultural practitioners, and which are generating further collaborative plans and projects.



c. While the methodology and event format developed for the Network was not especially innovative in itself, the mix of disciplines and cultures at every stage enabled productive dialogue to emerge. Insights were produced into the wide variety of different contexts within which motherhood is experienced within and across Europe; into a wide range of experiences, realities and complexities, enabling new reflections and thinking to be taken forward into individual and collaborative research projects; and into the challenge of confronting discipline-specific methodologies - especially in the tension between dealing with groups and dealing with individual experience or in the role of the personal in, for example, sociological research - and also demonstrated that it is possible to explore motherhood simultaneously as a broad social phenomenon and as a subjective experience.



d. On-line resources and open access pod-casts enable those who did not attend workshops (or conference) to share in proceedings and discussion.



e. Network blog enables on-going interaction, discussion and sharing of relevant texts on motherhood.





(ii) Content



a. Network events and activities demonstrate that much still remains to be said about issues which impact on mothering and on women's experiences of motherhood, and that producing narratives of women's experiences of motherhood is an on-going and arguably endless process.



b. Conventional understandings of motherhood had to be broadened to include situations before birth, after death, non-motherhood and, to some extent, fatherhood. Issues around adoption, infertility, non-biological mothers (and different claims to biology), new reproductive technologies, disability, and loss and death contributed to a questioning of stereotypes of who or what a mother is.



c. Many different discourses have an impact on how motherhood is lived in everyday life - for example, political, legal, institutional, ideological, scientific, health, economic, managerial and popular media discourses - and the interdisciplinary and cross-cultural forum of the Network highlighted ways in which such discourses are in tension with each other and how they are manipulated and controlled, raising the importance of resisting them.



d. Interdisciplinary dialogue was found to ground, nuance and contextualise dominant legal and 'scientific' accounts of women, mothering and reproductivity.



e. Emergent themes and issues included:

 - continued gender and ideological bias in relation to employment trends of and discourse about working mothers at a European level, especially in relation to the politics and policies of austerity;

 - the radical difference within Europe of mothering and parenting practices and discourses;

 - migration, which is an increasing force in Europe, reinforces and exacerbates many problematic issues which mothers face, such as, for example, guilt, yet it can also empower them;

 - maternal ambivalence and violence are particularly complex and troubling issues, which literary narratives can open up, nuance and help to shape social and legal responses to;

 - emerging family patterns, such as same-sex parenting and the kinds of motherhood that are coming into being through reproductive technologies, challenge cultural norms of motherhood, and literature can take on a lobbying role in this respect and help re-shape attitudes and norms;

 - religion is often felt as a tension in motherhood - as both support and hindrance - and literature offers an imagined space in which such tensions may be creatively explored and shared.



f. By raising the profile of literature in interdisciplinary dialogue, the impact of literature was found to be multiple, including:

 - contributing fully to critical interpretation of the social, emotional and personal contexts of motherhood;

 - presenting a direct challenge to the supposed objectivity and impersonality which can dominate work in the social sciences;

 - providing insights and soliciting and shaping emotional reaction to difficult issues, which, for example, legal and medical reports on similar subject matter do not provide;

 - confronting readers with uncomfortable, distressing and complex issues and experiences, and opening up nuanced situations that work against judgement and categorisation, thus forcing reappraisal of normative judgements and thinking;

 - creating different ways of seeing and of making meaning;

 - subverting and resisting normative discourse;

 - creating narratives of new mothering practices and experiences, mediating social norms and raising questions for discussion;

 - realising the interaction between literature and thought;

 - inscribing personal experiences of motherhood (including through fiction) in order to find a voice and language for expressing extraordinary experiences and feelings;

 - exploring ways to say what cannot normally be articulated or is particularly difficult to articulate and to hear, such as anxieties, trauma, exclusion, psychic structures;

 - through translation, widening the scope of literature's cultural impacts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In developing methodologies for interdisciplinary and cross-cultural discussion of motherhood, the Network has raised the profile of literature - and the study of literature - in a pan-European context. It has illustrated how narratives and representations of motherhood and mothering in literary texts (both autobiographical and fictional) not only reflect reality but also reflect on it. It has shown how such narratives creatively and imaginatively explore, express and shape experience and emotions, offering insights into the complexity of mothers' intimate experiences and sense of self. Literature can create a spectrum of expression - by means of literary motifs, images, metaphors, and other literary strategies - for experiences and feelings that may otherwise be difficult to articulate. As such, it may be used by practitioners dealing with mothers and families - such as social workers, therapists, teachers, politicians, lawyers and social policy makers - as a supplement to women's voices in the real world, as a way of understanding and opening up mothers' experiences. Literary narratives and representations may also aid individual women to articulate and understand their own experience of mothering, or to feel they are not alone with certain difficulties and dilemmas.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A143A8EB-72E6-4927-ABB9-CF39497EC182</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative
