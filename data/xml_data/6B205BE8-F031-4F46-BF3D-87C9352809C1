It underpins expertise in integrated photonics platforms such as silicon photonics, mid-IR photonics, non-linear photonics and high speed electronics, all of which make use of a common fabrication platform. The convergence of electronics and photonics underpins a host of technologies ranging from future internet to consumer products, and from biological and chemical sensing to communications. The integration of electronics and photonics is recognised as the only way to manage the massive data demands of the future, and is consequently crucial to the continuation of the digital age. 

Silicon Photonics is an example of an emerging technology that will bring photonics to mass markets via integration with electronics. Integrated silicon systems are projected to serve a market in excess of $700M by 2024 (Yole Development, 2014), but is reliant on photonics converging with electronics. Furthermore, some aspects of silicon photonics will encompass non-linear photonics in second generation devices for all optical processing in a fully integrated platform. Similarly, related technologies such as SiGe-on-Insulator and Ge-on-Insulator are poised to revolutionise the next generation of communications and integrated sensor technologies, all on an integrated platform with electronics and non-linear photonics. Underpinning a team in these crucial areas of expertise supported by a flexible funding platform will enable us to pioneer work in these technology areas, and to add value to ideas that emerge.

The convergence of electronics and photonics will result in complex integrated systems, linked via fabrication technologies. Electronic-photonic integration has yet to be addressed in a meaningful way in silicon based technologies, and this team collectively have the essential skills to do so, at an institution that possesses the key fabrication equipment to facilitate success. Due to the complex nature of fabrication for research, existing RAs are fully utilised, and have little or no additional scope for strategic research. The platform grant will give us the opportunity to dedicate fabrication resource and RA skills to strategic projects, and specific innovation. We will do this by utilising the RAs within the project to deliver work of significant strategic importance to the portfolio of grants held by the group, whilst also developing the research and managerial skills of the RAs by giving them specific management responsibilities whilst being mentored by one of the investigators.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The convergence of electronics and photonics is driven by the need for more efficient and flexible systems, as well as more energy efficient systems. Whilst many applications relate to communications based industries, in particular internet and computing systems, there are a plethora of ICT systems that need to be more efficient as well as more technically effective for future generations of system implementations, or these systems will not be viable in a digital age in which energy is not limitless. The impact on society will be through the enhanced performance of ICT platforms for the digital economy and the reduction in greenhouse gases and energy usage of these platforms (currently the ICT sector contributes 2% of global carbon emission, more than the entire airline industry ). This will be enabled by the development of energy efficient optoelectronic circuits in silicon-based material systems for a plethora of applications. Direct benefits include: the ability to fabricate fully integrated optoelectronic circuits on silicon and silicon compounds, providing a way to increase the (now limited) number of interconnections that can be made to/from future generations of microprocessors (for example) and enabling freestanding remote sensors combined with processing electronics for both diagnostic and analysis based systems. This will provide improved performance and functionality, facilitate a reduction in the carbon footprint and open up a number of new applications.

The results of our research will have economic impact in the longer term, in a large number of fields by facilitating the mass production of circuits that include both electronics and photonics. That will be of benefit to a number of UK based manufacturers, particularly our project partners who will be well positioned to develop the work further. Similarly researchers within the field will enjoy increased opportunities for device and system level complexity and functionality, as well as increased numbers of application areas facilitated by potential integrated electronic-photonic devices, circuits, and systems. The impact on society will be through a variety of applications in mass production environments. These include, but are not limited to applications that provide high data transmission (typically via internet), faster computing and low power consumption and which will therefore impact day to day life.

The results will be monitored for any opportunities to file worthwhile patents. Exploitation of arising IP is likely to be via licensing or start-up opportunities. Southampton has substantial research support resources and considerable experience in the commercial exploitation of research as it has been the driving force behind a cluster of new companies that develop and manufacture products based on photonics technology.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1477729</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Dr Stevan Stankovic and Mr Nathan Soper were speakers at the Science and Engineering Festival 2016, part of British Science Week</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>662FF607-6C57-46D4-AF83-B4134A3E3BB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>General Public invited to see the technology of Southampton University.
