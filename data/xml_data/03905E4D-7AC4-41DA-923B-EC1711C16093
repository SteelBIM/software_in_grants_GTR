Furthermore, it focuses on the trade union?s role in the mediation of conflicting interests between national and migrant workers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research develops a comparative international perspective by looking at a national context particularly affected by recent intra-European immigration (UK) and expanding on a comparative study on Italy and the Netherlands previously carried out by the researcher. The aim of the comparison is to highlight differences between these countries and to point out variables and mechanisms responsible for the different outcomes. The analysis addresses three main aspects:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>factors influencing union stances towards labour immigration, immigration policies and migrant workers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>effects of union attitudes&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>the development of trade union interaction with migrant workers across time. The proposed methodology combines qualitative and quantitative methods to assess union formal debates, union actions and union outcomes in including migrant workers.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research falls in three of the ESRC major challenges (Social diversity and population dynamics, Security conflict and justice and, to a minor extent, Global Economic Performance, Policy and Management). 

The proposed research will impact on and inform: a) trade unions at national and local levels; b) national and local policy makers (with a specific focus on immigration and labour market); c) voluntary associations and anti-discrimination bodies; d) immigrant workers and communities; e) employers' associations representatives. 

Interaction with such users will be sought through a number of activities. 

At the local level, activities involving users will follow closely the idea of coproduction of knowledge. The applicant, in fact, plans to setup round tables involving a) trade unions officials; b) local administrators/policy advisors; c) local representatives of employers; d) members of established and competent voluntary associations; e) representatives of migrant and ethnic communities; f) vulnerable and precarious (national) workers organizations. The aim is to promote the dialogue between these actors, to address practical problems (including the issue of equality and diversity on workplaces), and to explore more general/strategic issues. In such round tables, the applicant will provide insights emerging from the research but at the same times she will gain direct knowledge on these issues from the inputs and debates with these key actors. Once successful, this local initiative would constitute an example of 'best practice' that could be circulated and implemented in different municipalities/regions. Facts and insights on the research findings will be provided to external users in order to promote a public discussion based on scientific evidence rather than social and cultural bias. 

A number of outreach activites such as public talks, web/media presence and a final national symposium will aim at raising public awareness of the importance of research in the socio-economic domain and, especially, the need for a rational and scientific approach to sensitive issues such as migration and integration. It is expected that this research will aid the development of a common vision and understanding among actors dealing with migration and labour market and through them impact on national policy -makers both in the UK and in Europe.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161868</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion in Europe (IMISCOE)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Netherlands, Kingdom of the</gtr:country><gtr:description>IITUE (Immigration, Immigrants, Trade Unions in Europe)</gtr:description><gtr:id>60332CE7-C5B2-44A0-9DFD-009DA55220C4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a multi-disciplinary collaboration involving migration studies and industrial relations studies.

One of the most relevant occasion has been the conference organized in relation to the end of the projects that has envisioned the participation of national and international scholars and practitioners (see video at - http://www.research.mbs.ac.uk/ewerc/Events).

Findings of the research have been used also to inform practitioners during a meeting organized by the European Trade Union Institute (ETUI), the Hans B&amp;ouml;ckler Foundation and the Cornell University (Transatlantic Social Dialogue (TSD) Brussels. May 22-24, 2016).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>F1131D67-42E1-423A-9225-D4DFB1DB4922</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The analysis has pointed out the differences across the three countries in dealing with immigration and migrant workers and has linked these differences to the particular institutional context in which the trade unions are embedded. Such institutional context also includes elements related to historical legacies and rooted traditions as for instance the attitude of the regulatory actors (including the State) in the employment relations framework. Internal variables linked to the structure of trade unions -such as identity, organizational structure, presence of self-organized bodies and their link with the other trade unions structure- have resulted fundamental in explaining the outcomes in terms of inclusion of migrant workers within the labour market and host society as well as within the trade union itself. The research has highlighted a series of procedures and mechanisms working in practice within the trade unions to produce differences across countries (e.g. the role of trade union democracy, the level of autonomy and integration of special bodies). However, the research has also outlined how external contextual pressures (increasing political populist rhetoric, increasing size of immigration and mobility, economic and labour market difficulties etc.) constitute stronger convergence forces of the trade union attitude towards migrant workers with respect of a recent past. Lowering trade union attention/amounts of resources spent to include migrant workers have resulted particularly relevant in those cases where trade union actions had been particularly successful in the past and where established procedures were in place (both in the Uk and in Italy). The importance of contextual factors (whose influence on trade union attitude was stronger than expected) has pushed the researcher to focus more on the analysis of the impact of external pressures on trade union attitude towards migrant workers (linking, from a theoretical point of view with the debate about convergence or divergence of industrial relations systems). This interest has resulted in the design of a new set of questions that have been the basis for research collaboration with a network of scholars ranging across ten European countries. This research network (IITUE-Immigration, Immifgrants and Trade Unions in Europe), founded by the researcher together with prof. Rinus Penninx (University of Amsterdam), has been supported by the IMISCOE (International Migration, Integration and Social Cohesion in Europe) network. The researcher has been also recently involved in the design and implementation of an ESRC seminar series on the research topic and has been recently invited to participate to a ETUI (European Trade Union Institute) conference. Following the successful completion of the scholarship, the fellow has been granted a permanent position as a lecturer of employment studies at the University of Manchester. To learn more about outcomes, please see other sections.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings are at the basis of an edited book that the researcher is leading together with Prof. Rinus Penninx and Dr Judith Roosblad (University of Amsterdam). The book proposal (which has been awarded by the ILO) envisions the analysis of ten national case studies based on a common research framework provided by the researcher. The outcomes of the ESRC research (ES/K001752/1), therefore, have become the starting points for further comparative analysis. Research papers and articles published have been already quoted in other scholars work. The end of the research conference has provided the occasion to discuss research findings with a number of national and international scholars and practitioners. Contribute to academic and non-academic debate on the topic are expected both in the UK as well as in Italy and the Netherlands in the form of interventions in debate and writing of ad hoc reports.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D6C958F8-13E9-492E-A261-09FAD6D26A54</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and
