The control of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia, where approximately 10% of pregnant women get infected with malaria, could receive a potential boost through a new study conducted by the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology and the Timika Research Facility in Indonesia. Together with experts from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK, they are going to test two new methods of preventing malaria and the harmful effects in pregnancy. 

When pregnant women contract malaria this can have devastating consequences for pregnancy, resulting in fever which may trigger preterm onset of labour or even pregnancy loss. It is also possible for women to be infected without showing any outward signs or symptoms, yet if these infections are undetected and left untreated, they can cause anaemia in the mother and can interfere with the growth of the fetus leading to low birth weight, which increases the risk of babies dying during infancy.

The new project will provide malaria testing to women with or without the symptoms of malaria on every scheduled antenatal visit using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The RDT is simple to perform, uses a single drop of blood and gives results within 15 minutes. Those women testing positive will be treated with an artemisinin combination drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), which is the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy in Indonesia. A second method called intermittent preventive treatment, which is used in most countries in Africa but not yet in Asia, will also be tested. With this method women without symptoms of malaria will be selected to receive the same drug but without prior blood testing. 

Both methods will be compared with the existing policy in Indonesia, where all pregnant women are tested for malaria on the first antenatal visit only, and those with a positive result are treated with DHP. During subsequent antenatal visits, women are only tested if they have symptoms of malaria such as fever. This means that some infections will go undetected. It is anticipated that the two new methods will either detect infections much earlier than the current approach, or prevent them altogether.

The findings of this study, together with an assessment of feasibility and cost effectiveness of each method, will be used to inform malaria prevention policy for pregnant women in Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>BACKGROUND:
Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) can have devastating consequences to mother and newborn, yet the harmful effects are entirely preventable. Annually, 70% of 125.2 million pregnancies in malaria endemic regions occur in the Asia-Pacific region, and cost-effective prevention strategies are urgently needed in this region which has predominantly low-intensity falciparum and vivax transmission. Indonesia is the first country in Asia to introduce systematic screening at first antenatal visit (Single Screening and Treatment: SSTp). SSTp may not detect subsequent infections. A proposed extension is intermittent screening and treatment (ISTp) consisting of repeated screening with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as part of focused antenatal care and treating the RDT positive women with long-acting drugs that also provides several weeks of post-treatment prophylaxis. Screening strategies however may miss low density PCR-positive infections, not detectable by RDT or microscopy. Recently completed surveys in Asia have shown an unexpectedly high prevalence of these infections in asymptomatic pregnant women. Under these circumstances, intermittent preventive therapy (IPTp) is another approach, not yet evaluated in Asia though widely used in sub-Saharan Africa. 

OBJECTIVES AND METHODS:
Open-label three-arm parallel-group multicentre cluster-randomised controlled superiority trial conducted in two rural sites in Eastern Indonesia comparing the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of IPTp and ISTp with the current SSTp strategy. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine will be used in all three arms. The study is designed to detect 50% reduction in malaria infection at birth from 10% to 5%; Unit of randomization: antenatal clinics. Sample size: 23 clusters of 41 women per arm (N=3198) (Power 90%, alpha 0.025, ICC 0.002, allowing for 20% loss-to-follow-up and 13% efficiency loss due to varying cluster sizes). Secondary endpoints include clinical malaria, maternal anaemia, preterm birth, low birthweight and safety endpoints. Enrolled women of all parities in the 2nd trimester make 3 or 4 scheduled ANC visits 6-8 weeks apart. Infant follow-up is 42 days. Sub-studies of the cost-effectiveness, acceptability/feasibility studies will be conducted alongside the main clinical trial. 

PARTNERS AND PRODUCT: 
The project builds on an existing MiP research collaborations between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (trial sponsor), the Eijkman Institute in Jakarta (coordinating Institute) and between the Timika Research Facility in Indonesia, and the Menzies School of Health Research, Australia and is designed to inform national, regional and global policy. It is designed in close collaboration with the policy makers and main implementers in Indonesia, notably the MoH, WHO and UNICEF-Indonesia.

The project will take 3.5 years.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2426004</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An abstract art STOPMIP logo was created which represented a pregnant woman, the drug dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine used for malaria preventive treatment and a RDT for intermittent screening test.

Globally, there is now considerable experience with artemisinin derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. A systematic review of the efficacy and safety of ACTs for the treatment of malaria in non-pregnant adults and children conducted to inform the 2nd edition of the malaria treatment guidelines by WHO, showed that DHP is very effective and provides long durations of post-treatment prophylaxis similar to mefloquine and longer durations than amodiaquine (AQ-artesunate, or AQ-SP), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem&amp;reg;) based antimalarial combinations.
A GMP formulation of DHP has recently become available as Eurartesim, manufactured by Sigma-Tau, Italy and approved in October 2011 by the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) for treatment of malaria</gtr:description><gtr:id>DD9CCD0A-0A82-4586-B8DF-80B1134D2724</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The primary purpose of the trial is to inform policy makers on selecting suitable interventions for the prevention of malaria at national, regional and global levels. Indonesia has extensive experience with DHP, and is the first country to have made DHP the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. Indonesia is also the first country to introduce screening as the national MiP policy as part of antenatal care. In these settings ISTp with DHP is therefore a logical extension of the existing SSTp strategy. Because the large Island nation of Indonesia has one of the most diverse malaria epidemiology globally, a one-size-fits-all policy (as currently recommended for Africa), will not be appropriate for Indonesia. Information on both new interventions (ISTp and IPTp) is therefore needed; e.g. IPTp may be considered in the low-medium transmission intensity regions, such as parts of Papua, whereas ISTp may be the better option in lower transmission areas and SSTp in areas with the lowest transmission. 
Indonesia has been a regional pioneer with the development of its current SSTp strategy to control MiP and thus the data of this proposed trial would have relevance to other Asian countries in deciding on MiP control programmes. This study, together with two other ongoing prevention trials in India and Papua New Guinea (PNG), will potentially have important policy implications for most malaria endemic countries in Asia and possibly Latin America.</gtr:impact><gtr:stage>Early clinical assessment</gtr:stage><gtr:status>Actively seeking support</gtr:status><gtr:title>DHP for IPTp</gtr:title><gtr:type>Management of Diseases and Conditions</gtr:type><gtr:yearDevCompleted>2011</gtr:yearDevCompleted></gtr:productOutput></gtr:productOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The OSRS is a web based data reporting dashboard developed by the STOPMiP data managers.

Retrospective Health systems data from 2010 and 2011 on clinic visits due to clinical malaria in the general population (all ages, all genders) were collected from all potential village clusters in Timika and South West-Sumba. In addition annual malaria surveillance data was obtained from the District Health Offices at the two sites. 
Complete data was available on the monthly incidence rate of smear confirmed clinical malaria using census data as the denominator. A malaria risk map was produced for each of the two study sites, with the support of Dr Iqbal Elyazar from the Eijkman Institute who works closely with the Malaria Atlas Project (MAP). As anticipated, the data shows marked heterogeneity in malaria risk and stresses the potential value of matching cluster for randomization.
Baseline data on the risk of asymptomatic malaria in pregnant women obtained from the existing ANC screening program (Single screening and treatment [SSTp]) was also available, but not from all clusters. Since the risk is strongly correlated with the risk of clinical malaria in the population, the latter will be used for matching.</gtr:description><gtr:id>353549D6-042B-421B-B360-A739B48BAB67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Impact: The risk maps were provided to the District Health Offices in the two study sites, SW Sumba and Timika which shows the distribution of malaria at village level and helps the decision process of DHO on malaria control activities.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Malaria risk map</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A detailed Data Management Plan was developed including the use of Teleform for data entry.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CDF0CA84-B95A-460B-BC55-3E2EE9CF6644</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This has contributed to the capacity development of Data Managers and Data Assistants of the collaborating institute</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Data Management Plan</gtr:title><gtr:type>Biological samples</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">G1100654</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>03BA7BC9-C251-48FC-8EA9-5F7414A63FEE</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Infection</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>4F7FE31F-D266-4FE9-9BAB-3D21E9B789BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>3.3  Nutrition and chemoprevention</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>7135039D-2DB0-4D41-87B3-FA1C8D38E133</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>50</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.1  Pharmaceuticals</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
