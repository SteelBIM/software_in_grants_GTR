Materials, Energy and Products (CIE-MAP)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N022645/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>One third of the world's energy is used in industry to make products - the buildings, infrastructure, vehicles, capital equipment and household goods that sustain our lifestyles. Most of this energy is needed in the early stages of production to convert raw materials, such as iron ore or trees, into stock materials like steel plates or reels of paper and because these materials are sold cheaply, but use a lot of energy, they are already extremely energy efficient. Therefore, the key materials with which we create modern lifestyles - steel, cement, plastic, paper and aluminium in particular - are the main 'carriers' of industrial energy, and if we want to make a big reduction in industrial energy use, we need to reduce our demand for these materials. In the UK, our recent history has led to closure of much of our capacity to make these materials, and although this has led to reductions in emissions occurring on UK territory, in reality our consumption of materials has grown, and the world's use of energy and emission of greenhouse gases has risen as our needs are met through imports.

CIE-MAP therefore aims to enable delivery of significant reductions in the use of both energy and energy-intensive materials in the industries that supply the UK's physical needs. To achieve this, we need to understand the operation and performance of the whole material and energy system of UK industry; we need to understand better our patterns of consumption both in households, and in government and industry purchasing, particularly related to replacement decisions; we need to look for opportunities to innovate in products, processes and business models to use less material while serving the same need; and we need to identify the policy, business and consumer triggers that would lead to significant change while supporting UK prosperity.

The proposer team have already developed broad-ranging work aiming to address this need, in close collaboration with industry and government partners: work on energy and emissions embodied in trade at Leeds has shown how UK emissions and energy demand in industry have declined largely due to a shift of production elsewhere, while the true energy requirements of our consumption have grown; in Bath, work on embodied energy and emissions has created a widely adopted database of materials, and the Transitions and Pathways project has established a clear set of policy opportunities for low carbon technologies that we can now apply to demand reduction; work on sustainable consumption at Nottingham Trent has shown how much of our purchased material is discarded long before it is degraded, looked at how individuals define their identity through consumption, and begun to tease out possible interventions to influence these wasteful patterns of consumption; Cardiff have undertaken extensive research on public perceptions, attitudes and behaviour. 

The proposal is strongly supported by four key government departments, the Committee on Climate Change, and a wide network of smaller organisations whose interests overlap with the proposed Centre, and who wish to collaborate to ensure rich engagement in policy and delivery processes. Mechanisms, including a Fellows programme for staff exchange in the UK and an International Visiting Fellows programme for global academic leaders, have been designed to ensure that the activities of the Centre are highly connected to the widest possible range of activities in the UK and internationally which share the motivation to deliver reductions in end-use energy demand in Industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposal describes a set of specific outputs as part of its deliverables, but its fundamental mechanism for delivering impact is through a design based on deep engagement across all stakeholders involved in determining or benefitting from industrial energy use. The key groups of potential beneficiaries are listed here, with descriptions of how the activity of the Centre is likely to have an impact through them:

UK Industry: as well as gaining greater clarity on opportunities for energy efficiency, the major opportunity for industrial partners is to seek new business opportunities related to adding more value with less material. This area has had little academic or commercial attention to date, but research has demonstrated that opportunities for new business models, new process development, new product designs, and new management of material systems can become attractive and provide profitable commercial openings.

The UK government: The government's sequence of Climate Budgets developed with the Committee on Climate Change has as yet taken no account of opportunities associated with material production and use, so the Centre offers a new raft of policy options. This is of particular importance as recent policy has been unable to reduce industrial energy use: the most energy intensive industries should apparently make the most reductions in energy use, but precisely because they are energy intensive, they are also the most efficient, so further taxes or other charges on emissions or energy have little effect on their motivation.

The UK Academic community: CIE-MAP will be internationally leading, and is designed as a national hub, but not to be exclusive. The proposers are engaged as co-investigators in other energy related projects in the UK, and will actively seek to draw in other UK colleagues to this rich research area.

International policy: The director is a lead author of the next IPCC report, which creates a channel to connect CIE-MAP outputs to wider processes. The directors have also been engaged in broad range of international policy networks in the European Union where, as in the UK, policy-makers are short of options for reducing emissions from energy-intensive industry, and actively looking for new approaches. 

Skills and training: The Centre will employ 15 PDRAs, at least 5 PhD students, engage with partners through a Fellows programme, support masters and undergraduate project students, and contribute to executive education programmes in order to share well-founded insights into the use of energy and materials in UK industry and our opportunities to change demand. 

The public: The Centre's communication officer will deliver Centre insights to the wider public through the website, through material developed for schools, through annual reports and other publications and through well developed releases for the media.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3046231</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Committee on Climate Change (CCC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Setting the fifth carbon budget inquiry</gtr:description><gtr:id>E57E59AA-0529-4979-8076-ED9ABC4D74B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>To present evidence in March 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Requesting advice based on our proposal</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Submitted advice and have been selected to present evidence</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Global Green and Healthy Hositals (GGHH)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Global Green and Health Hospitals Expert Pannelist</gtr:description><gtr:id>AEF94F17-9028-498B-AD03-74681124798B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>TBC</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Requested Advice</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Expert Pannelist</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Research collaboration with UCL</gtr:description><gtr:id>D28A36EE-36FA-4297-B1CF-F72F39154C66</gtr:id><gtr:impact>See Journal Articles</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint model development with 1 lead publication</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Joint model development with 1 lead publication</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cole, C. and Cooper, T.

This event - held at the BEIS conference centre - aimed to highlight the necessity of building the circular economy (reuse, recycle, repair, durability) into the UK's future industrial plans in order to meet COP21 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets. This will be a challenging process but also offers the opportunity for the UK to become a world leader in new industrial practices.

The work will feed into the practical plans needed to enact the findings of the 2050 Industrial Roadmaps, (which were published in 2015 and gave recommendations for reducing GHG targets in the eight most energy intensive industries in the UK (iron and steel; chemicals; oil refining; food and drink; pulp and paper; cement; glass; ceramics)

The contributors

The delegates heard from Niall Mackenzie, Director of Infrastructure and Materials (BEIS) who confirmed that outcomes of the conference would be fed into a green paper for the Autumn statement (23/11/16) and a white paper for next year's budget laying out the government's industrial strategy. The group also heard the positions of BEIS and Defra on the Industrial Roadmaps and the circular economy from Charlie Lewis, Head of Industrial Decarbonisation and Energy Efficiency (BEIS), and Arjan Geveke, Assistant Director of Energy Policy (BEIS).

The CIE-MAP presentation focused on the need to build the circular economy into energy intensive industries and the opportunities it provides. CIE-MAP argues that more emphasis needs to be placed on looking across the whole supply chain to lifecycle analysis, product design, and recycling products and materials.

The big questions

The remainder of the day was spent with the different stakeholders - including Prof Geoff Hammond of the Bath CIE-MAP team - discussing the big questions facing energy intensive industries in relation to the circular economy:

1) how lifecycle thinking in energy intensive industries can be accelerated and embedded

2) how products can be designed to be more durable and recyclable

3) how management can structure businesses to realise energy and material efficiency

5) how government can help these industries move up the value chain.

The group are leading the charge for reducing the waste and energy demand created by making unnecessary new products. They do this by encouraging the repairability and longevity of everything from electronics and white goods to clothes, cars and cooking equipment. The event follows on from the inaugural conference in 2015 and a future conference at Delft University is planned for 2017. With 70% of the CO2 emissions in manufacturing coming from the production process, the reduction of excessive manufacturing would make a sizeable dent in the efforts to meet greenhouse gas emissions targets.

 

A series of experts presented on research, policy and commercial developments in the field, broadly showing that there is a growing shift towards thinking about these issues as a means of reducing energy demand and waste without necessarily stifling commerce and innovation. For example, a greater emphasis on longer guarantees, service contracts and leasing of higher quality items could put the onus on manufacturers to address the throwaway culture and its environmental effects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.eueduk.com/product-lifetimes-summit-in-nottingham/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Adaptive Dynamic Decision Making for Energy and Resource Management Policy.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF3DE39C-C136-4561-B38B-681A9AD45D96</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The ISIE (International Society for Industrial Ecology) Conference 2015 - Taking Stock of Industrial Ecology, Guildford, UK.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Adaptive, dynamic policy for climate mitigation policy.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EC8A8F1E-113E-492F-9506-BA4A6CA4CB11</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interdisciplinary conference on Climate Change, Policy and Responsibilities, Leeds, UK</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>John Barrett provided a keynote speech to the Austrian Government and energy research council for Austria</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27CA60BA-7C8A-47D9-82D3-F3B766B54047</gtr:id><gtr:impact>John Barrett provided a keynote speech to the Austrian Government and energy research council for Austria on the future role of consumption based accounting (UKERC and CIE-MAP) - September, 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Scott, K. attended 'Science for Sustainable Development: Early-career Leaders Day' at the Royal Society for Chemistry, December 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>01AD5791-45BA-4BCD-B91D-4E649FCFD43E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Scott, K. attended 'Science for Sustainable Development: Early-career Leaders Day' at the Royal Society for Chemistry, December 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ukcds.org.uk/news-events/events/science-for-sustainable-development-early-career-leaders-day</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Climate Change Showcase, Nottingham Trent University</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4B5A1ED9-99FA-49F2-A87F-72BC73259698</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A climate change showcase where researchers across Nottingham Trent University gave a short presentation of their research that addresses issues associated with climate change.

There was a clear need within the UK Government to advance thinking related to energy demand modelling and resource efficiency and due to CIE-MAP's established and new networks, we have helped to fulfill this important role. This has ensured that the evidence from our research is directly supporting UK Government policy. 

We have provided examples below that highlight the increased engagement with industry and direct policy / modelling support provided to DECC, CCC and BEIS. In summary, CIE-MAP has supported DECC in updating the Energy and Emissions Projection model, which has involved re-estimating all of the equations that predict industrial energy. We held a very successful stakeholder event involving 10 different government departments and agencies and over 25 companies and are continuing to engage with many of them. CIE-MAP is also working with BEIS and Innovate UK to co-organise a conference on material efficiency to support the development of a 2050 industrial decarbonisation 'action plan' on the subject. We have contributed to a number of high profile reports including the CCC's evidence to parliament, Chief Scientific Advisor's report, and enquiries held by the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee.

The centre has produced a further 14 peer-reviewed publications in renowned journals. At an international level, CIE-MAP researchers have ensured that the advances in knowledge made in the UK are benefiting other countries, with strong engagement in the US, Japan and Austria. CIE-MAP has a clear plan to ensure the maximum impact of the research in the following 18 months with a range of centre outputs planned, including a special edition in a leading academic journal, a report of future UK scenarios, and workshops with Government and industry. The additional project (Opportunities and Barriers to Achieving Transitions in UK Energy and Materials Use - The Role of Publics, Society and Decision-Makers) led by Cardiff has been fully integrated into CIE-MAP. Cardiff University, partnered with the Green Alliance, combines qualitative and quantitative social science methodologies - in particular expert interviews and workshops, deliberative research and a (GB) national survey. Initial interviews with industry and policy representatives are now complete and the team is currently organising four workshops where members of the public will deliberate the identified pathways to change.

A particularly innovative aspect of the project is a set of targeted policy engagement activities where we will hold workshops, interviews and other direct stakeholder involvement, exploring the implications of the findings about public views with key decision-makers in UK businesses, policy and the political sphere (including Parliamentarians through the Green Alliance's Climate Leadership programme for MPs). Along with the empirical data gathered, these activities will allow us to formulate clear recommendations for action on achieving a reduction in UK final energy consumption through bringing knowledge of social barriers and opportunities to bear on governmental policy and industry decision-making about the innovative delivery/use of materials and products.

Policy:
? Further support on DECC-BIS 2050 Industrial Decarbonisation Roadmaps and Action Plans - CIE-MAP has supported an upcoming BEIS conference on material efficiency and the circular economy. We jointly planned the event with BEIS and KTN. This is a key event to develop an action plan for the UK Government on the role of the circular economy in UK Government policy. Our involvement was a direct result of CIE-MAP's stakeholder workshop held in May 2016. 
? Evidence to Energy and Climate Change Select Committee on the 5th Carbon Budget and support to the Committee on Climate Change - CIE-MAP provided evidence to the Parliamentary Committee with Prof. John Barrett being the only academic to be invited to give oral evidence to the committee. In addition, support and analysis was provided to the Committee on Climate Change for their report to parliament that proposed the adoption of the 5th Carbon Budget. This related to evidence on the role of infrastructure in future climate change emissions pathways and the role of resource consumption to mitigate emissions from industry.
? Direct support to the former department, DECC, in Energy and Emissions Projections - CIE-MAP has formed a strong relationship with the DECC Energy modelling team that provides the evidence on the effectiveness of a range of policies and programmes to reduce energy demand and emissions. CIE-MAP provided an update to the &amp;quot;Energy and Emissions Projections&amp;quot; model by updating many of the equations that define future industrial energy demand. The Energy Demand model is an important model for the UK Government, providing an analysis of future energy demand and GHG emissions for the UK. The outputs of the model underpin one of our key publications, the Energy and Emissions Projections Report, that informs the UK Government of their progress towards achieving the UK's legally binding target of reducing GHG emission by 80% by 2050. We are now in further discussions with BEIS on future improvements that could be made to the model. 
? Official provider of UK indicators on energy and consumption - CIE-MAP now provides the UK Government with one of their headline indicators related to GHG emissions, the &amp;quot;Consumption-based GHG Emissions account&amp;quot;. Each year, the UK Government now publishes the consumption-based emissions of the UK (see: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uks-carbon-footprint). This is provided by the University of Leeds and is a direct outcome of one of the models that has been developed within the centre, namely the UK Multi-Region Input-Output Model. This is an important development as it recognises that UK consumption and industry drives energy demand and emissions in other world regions, extending the scope of the UK to reduce energy demand.
? Development of a new indicator for the UK Government on resource productivity - Working with the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Office of National Statistics (ONS) and BEIS, CIE-MAP is developing a new approach to improve the UK Government's understanding of our ability to assess and measure resource productivity. CIE-MAP is the only academic partner supporting the cross-departmental group and seeks to inform the industrial strategy. This is being developed by providing important sectoral analysis of the relationship between economic output and resource use within UK industry.
? Supporting Government Chief Scientist - CIE-MAP has provided analysis to both the Government Chief Scientist and the DEFRA Chief Scientist by contributing to a high profile government report, setting the agenda for both research and policy. Beneficiaries include UK Government Departments (DEFRA, DECC and BEIS - plus WRAP, Zero-Waste Scotland, the CCC and the Devolved Administrations), Local Government, Businesses (especially SMEs).
Industry
? CIE-MAP researchers have given invited presentations to industry audiences at events organised by CIRIA, the Alliance for Sustainable Building Products, and the Construction Climate Challenge. These have focussed on topics such as 'Advances in innovative sustainable materials'; 'Embodied carbon and strategies for reduction'; and 'Reducing carbon in infrastructure construction'. This is in addition to engagement at trade events, such as UK Construction Week, Ecobuild and Resource, and the provision of focussed lunch time seminars for specialist firms operating within the field (e.g. Sturgis Carbon Profiling). CIE-MAP has also made contributions to construction industry guidance documents prepared by the UK Green Building Council and the Green Construction Board.
? CIE-MAP researchers are engaged in industry partnerships with WRAP as a result of Nottingham Trent University being a signatory to WRAP's Electrical and Electronic Equipment Sustainability Action Plan (eSAP) and Sustainable Clothing Acton Plan (SCAP). Regular meetings enable knowledge exchange, ensure the development of complementary research plans and ease access to industry sources for data collection.

Academic:
? This year has seen a strong academic output from the centre including 14 peer-reviewed papers, 23 conference papers, and 4 other published outputs.
? A CIE-MAP Director was Guest Editor for a special edition of Energies on &amp;quot;The Low Carbon Economy&amp;quot;.
? CIE-MAP researchers played a vital role in establishing the inaugural Product Lifetimes and the Environment (PLATE) conference in 2015, a ground-breaking event with keynote presentations, over 60 papers, workshops, and an exhibition. The success of PLATE confirmed that increased product lifetimes have become an important element in debate on resource efficiency, waste reduction and low carbon strategies for sustainability. It led to the establishment of an international consortium committed to planning and hosting biennial PLATE conferences, the next of which will take place in Delft in 2017. 

Other: 
? Global Cities Programme with C40 - The methodology developed by CIE-MAP (the allocation of global energy demand to the consumption pattern of cities) is now being adopted by 82 mega cities across the world through a new programme of research led by C40. CIE-MAP, along with Arup, are providing the initial assessment of every city. This will be launched at a high level meeting of city mayors in late 2017.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3055E2D4-53C3-4519-BF57-400565AF19FD</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The core research vision for CIE-MAP remains unchanged with our original aim to enable delivery of significant reductions in the use of both energy and energy-intensive materials in the Industries that supply the UK's physical needs. To achieve this goal, the centre recognised the need to transform thinking in both government and industry to acknowledge that polices, strategies and business approaches related to materials and products can have a significant impact on energy demand. When the centre started there were very poor links between key government departments and little recognition of this issue. This has changed considerably over the past three years, and there is clear evidence to demonstrate that CIE-MAP has played an important role in making this happen. On many occasions, CIE-MAP has acted as a bridge between DEFRA (responsible for resource efficiency) and DECC (now incorporated into BEIS). 

CIE-MAP has produced sound empirical evidence that is now appearing in a range of government publications and helping to guide action in BEIS. Our evidence has featured and guided thinking in the Committee on Climate Change, BEIS, WRAP, Chief Scientist reports and modelling teams in DECC. We acknowledge that this is the start of the journey but now have the networks and influence to enable change in climate policy. Our goal is for resource consumption issues to be included in the UK Government's Carbon Plan in 2017. 

The modelling capacity within the research teams has improved significantly. This has allowed CIE-MAP to produce robust empirical evidence at short notice for key government initiatives. This includes our models of UK material flows and the relationship with energy demand, more detailed assessment of the UK's consumption based emissions, the ability to forecast UK energy demand and emissions and a stronger evidence base on individual sectors including automobiles, paper and pulp, and construction. 
CIE-MAP has a greater apprehension of the &amp;quot;big hitters&amp;quot; in terms of strategies to deliver reductions in industrial energy. Our research on the circular economy has provided a sound evidence base on the scope for reduction in materials consumption in individual sectors.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>There is still little understanding of the scale of change needed to avoid some of the most significant consequences of climate change. The IPCC clearly outlines the need for energy intensity to improve within the region of 80 to 90% by 2100 to have a reasonable probability of avoiding above two degree temperature rises. The general consensus in academic analysis is that this cannot be delivered by energy efficiency measures alone. However, this is inconsistent with thermodynamic laws, public opinion, and the lack of appetite for government intervention, while also failing to address wider economic issues such as re-bound effects. This is a considerable research challenge and requires the bringing together of key disciplines to address these fundamental questions. Some of these key questions include:
? What are the macro effects on energy demand from micro-level changes to energy efficiency?
? What new institutions and governance structures are required to deliver government wide responses to the need for energy demand reduction?
? What are the wider implications of rapid energy demand reduction to the economy, employment and investment?
? What data collection and evaluation is required to underpin policy and strategies for government, businesses and households on energy demand reduction?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DBDC24DA-26B8-4F66-8745-EED480741654</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ciemap.ac.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Energy Research Partnership - Influencing high level civil servants on the role of resource efficiency</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A157F7B3-4073-45B4-9D14-3B71D70CF315</gtr:id><gtr:impact>CIE-MAP played in instrumental role in contributing to a publication that has the ability to influence the heads of all UK Government departments.
