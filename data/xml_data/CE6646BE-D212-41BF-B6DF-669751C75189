The key will be to exploit the biphasic nature of the GXLs to maximize the efficiency not only of the reaction itself but also of the separation of the product and photosensitizer. Our strategy is to build a relatively small high pressure falling-film reactor, FFR, where the liquid flows down a plate thereby giving more precise control over reaction conditions. The design has been chosen to give us flexibility in the way that the reactor is configured (e.g. concurrent or counter-current flow, etc). Combining this flexibility with the modular nature of the high-pressure equipment available in Nottingham will allow us to modify our approach rapidly in response to our experimental results. A particular advantage of the design is that, in most cases, it will allow us to carry out control experiments in the absence of CO2 so that we can establish the precise effect of CO2 on a given reaction. Our chemical programme focuses on four classes of reactions chosen in consultation with our partners, specifically for their relevance to pharmaceutical process chemistry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>322672</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Thomas Swan and Co Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Thomas Swan and Co Ltd</gtr:description><gtr:id>347752C0-D7E8-45B2-A40C-1CD0297E9637</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>42000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Impact Acceleration</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>University of Nottingham</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:fundingRef>EP/K503800/1</gtr:fundingRef><gtr:id>BEF183B3-6AF9-4D5A-9322-9CD23D3447FD</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our chemical programme has focused on several classes of reactions chosen in consultation with our partners, specifically for their relevance to pharmaceutical process chemistry. Achievements include demonstrating that (i) the reactions occur by zero-order kinetics - the rate depends on the light intensity; (ii) reactions are faster than control reactions in carbon tetrachloride solution; (iii) our small-scale reactions reactions can be scaled up by ca. 3000 times to deliver up to 100 mL of product in 8 hours; (iv) surfactants can be used to solubilise photosensitisers which would otherwise be insoluble in CO2 and (v) photosensitisers can be immobilized in polymer films or on polymer beads to deliver pure products without contamination from any photsensitiser.

1O2 is additionally attractive for pharmaceutical process chemistry which has a pressing need for transformations that combine reduction in waste with complex chemistry. In particular, our Project has focused on two aspects of Green chemistry, formation of allylic alcohols, and safe use of O2 in non-chlorinated solvents, recently highlighted as being of specific importance to the pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, the low tonnages in most pharmaceutical processes mean that the degree of scale-up required is less than in many sectors of the chemical industry.

Our aim has been to demonstrate the feasibility of continuous photochemical reactions of 1O2 in pure supercritical CO2 and in solvents expanded with CO2, so-called Gas-Expanded liquids, GXLs. The key has been to maximize the efficiency not only of the reaction itself but also of the separation of the product and photosensitizer. Our strategy has been to build a relatively small high pressure sapphire tubular reactor, to give precise control over reaction conditions. The design was chosen to give us flexibility in the way that the reactor could be configured (e.g. upward or downward flow, etc). Combining this flexibility with the modular nature of the high-pressure equipment available in Nottingham has allowed us to modify our approach rapidly in response to our experimental results. Our approach has been combined with high-intensity light emitting diodes giving a reactor with a space time yield up to 700 times greater than for traditional Schenck reactors and with a considerably reduced energy requirement for the light source.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>This project has already been taken forward, particularly in connection with the semi-synthetic production of artemisinin, an important antimalarial drug, where reaction with photochemically generated singlet O2 is a key step. We have received funding from both Sanofi, the company that is currently commercializing the semi-synthetic route and also from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
