This will allow research access to individual level information on some 18 million individuals, a large proportion of those who have ever lived in Scotland between 1855 to the present day. At the moment these records are kept as indexed images. This means that to extract any data, a researcher must search for an individual record by name and then manually transcribe the information they need themselves (eg cause of death, occupation etc.); this of course makes any large scale research impossible. A one off investment would mean that these records could made available for major population research. 

This dataset will be prepared for linkage to existing longitudinal studies, primarily the Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS), and more generally to the already highly developed Scottish health informatics systems. This will allow the characteristics (place of birth, age at marriage, occupation, longevity, cause of death etc) of parents, grandparents and other relatives of those followed by the SLS to be analysed and will therefore enhance contemporary Scottish and UK health datasets, health informatics systems, longitudinal datasets and genetic studies. People surviving to have children, grandchildren and other descendents are unlikely to be fully representative of the historic population of Scotland, and the complete transcription will importantly enable a complete linkage exercise between the different to create full or partial life histories for all those experiencing vital events in Scotland since 1855.This will mean that for the first time the UK will have a data system of a similar potential depth and breadth as the Scandinavian and Low countries, whose population registers provide such life histories, with countries, where work such as those using &amp;quot;The Demographic Database&amp;quot; at Ume&amp;aacute; University, Sweden; the &amp;quot;Historical Population Registers&amp;quot; Project at the Norwegian Historical Data Centre, University of Tromso, Norway and the Historical Sample of the Netherlands, based at the International Institute of Social History, Amsterdam, Netherlands is currently extending knowledge of demography as well as economic and social history over the nineteenth and early decades of the twentieth century. Such a dataset will bring the possibility of exploring the condition of the present Scottish population within the context of their families through multiple generations of micro-data.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will not involved the production of research output, although it will play an important role in maximising the impact of outputs of projects by researchers using dataset produced (see Pathways to Impact). However in other parts of the application, we have outlined how the data may be used. From this it is possible to identify research areas that this data will support and therefore potential beneficiaries. There will of course be many ways that innovative researchers will use this data, that we cannot yet envisage. 

Those working in Social policy will benefit from a deeper understanding:
- of social mobility across 150 years
- the impact of a developing welfare state
- the nature of industrialisation and its impact on populations 
- of fertility 

Those working in Educational policy will have an insight into
- the impact of changing educational policy over 150 

Those working in public health will come to better understand
- the effect of food shortages for mothers during pregnancy on the later life (intergenerational) health of the child
- the impact of urbanisation and severe environmental insults - on health
- the long-term effect of serious viruses (eg the 1918 influenza pandemic) on the surviving population

Those working in the NHS
- will benefit potentially from better family history risk assessment tools
- will more easily be able to produce genealogies in support of clinical genetic counselling services
- will benefit from refinement to genetic studies that will be gained from extensive pedigrees, this is likely to be a substantial impact

The public
- the Scottish public will benefit from the enhancements to their healthcare system
- may very directly benefit from enhancements to the genetic cancer counselling service and family history as used in clinical practise
- they will also benefit from the added attractiveness to researchers across many sectors - including the biomedical field - of the enhanced data environment that exists in Scotland and that will be enhanced with the dataset.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2457746</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Geocoding 24 million historical addresses in Scotland from 1855 to 1974 (EHPS-Net Meeting)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>58AA13FA-DE94-4D59-84CA-1DC881B6F27D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>talk sparked questions and discussion afterwards as purpose was to share H-GIS methods

Much of the workshop was spent in dialouge between the historians and the computer scientists, to learn each others language(s) and ways of thinking. The historians realised that not everyone can read historic documents and that data can be organised and thought of in a myriad of ways. The computer scientists learned that very little historical data is straight forward and that historians don't look at data in the same way at all. Progress was made and mutual understanding moved forward.

However it is possible to identify areas of research that this data will support and therefore potential beneficiaries. There will of course be many ways that innovative researchers will use this data that we cannot yet envisage. Such research and analysis will enhance contemporary Scottish and UK health datasets, health informatics systems, longitudinal datasets and genetic studies. Many of the new potential research opportunities made available through the DS project are listed on the DS website (http://www.lscs.ac.uk/projects/digitising-scotland/research-potential-of-digitising-scotland).

The LSCS centre has put considerable time into organising and structuring this DS work, sharing knowledge and building networks across Europe. Though close collaboration with other countries working on similar data we successfully won a Horizon 2020 Marie Curie Innovative Training Networks (ITN) European Training Networks (ETN) 'Methodologies and Data mining techniques for the analysis of Big Data based on Longitudinal Population and Epidemiological Registers' (http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/200475_en.html). We will have 2 early stage researchers (ESR) based in Edinburgh with close association with DS along with 4 research stays from other ESRs within the network all working in historical demography on short research projects aligned with the DS project. The 4 ESRs will take back learning from their stays within the LSCS centre to their home institutions to enhance further research projects.

Similar historical data enhancement projects are being attempted in a number of countries. From attending workshops and within networks there has been considerable interest in the DS techniques and software products for automatically coding text (occupations and causes of death) and geolocation that we have developed. We are sharing this learning and products with these projects given the DS work will have further applications - and has already been used by 2 projects. Specifically the automatic classification software developed within DS was used to classify English language occupation strings to the HISCO classification system, for Prof. Marco van Leeuwen, of the Sociology Department at Utrecht University. Additionally, another project within the wider LSCS centre involves the creation of new Scottish Longitudinal Study (SLS) Birth Cohort of 1936 (SLSBC1936), which includes information from the Scottish Mental Survey of 1947 (SMS1947) - a cognitive ability test that almost all Scottish children born in 1936 sat - and linked it to the Census-like 1939 National Register, the current NHS Central Register (NHSCR) and the SLS. We coded the occupations from this based on the DS automatic classification software.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6758742C-0EC0-40B5-8F20-6CAE2D4C989A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project aims to digitise the 24 million vital events record images (births, marriages and deaths) for all people in Scotland since 1855 (ie transcribe them into machine encoded text).

This project has main 4 objectives within 4 workpackages, to:
[1] digitise vital events records back to 1855.
[2] to develop a method and software package to automatically code occupational descriptions to the Historical International Standard Classification of Occupations (HISCO).
[3] to develop a frame with which to code cause of death descriptions to a standardised Classification of Disease and to produce a software package for separating different causes and then classifying them automatically.
[4] to develop a method and software package to link the addresses on the records to a consistent, through time, geographical reference. 

The research in workpackage 2-4 have demonstrated that it is possible to automatically code the textual information in the records using machine learning techniques. This is of course vital to an endeavor that needs to 24 million records.

Because this project is developing a research infrastructure at the moment, there have been no research discovery as yet, however one might expect the dataset to enable the following type of questions to be answered.

Those working in Social policy will benefit from a deeper understanding:
- of social mobility across 150 years
- the impact of a developing welfare state
- the nature of industrialisation and its impact on populations 
 
Those working in Educational policy will have an insight into
- the impact of changing educational policy over 150 

Those working in public health will come to better understand
- the effect of food shortages for mothers during pregnancy on the later life (intergenerational) health of the child
- the impact of urbanisation and severe environmental insults - on health
- the long-term effect of serious viruses (eg the 1918 influenza pandemic) on the surviving population
