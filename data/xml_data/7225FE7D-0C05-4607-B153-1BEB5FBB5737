Alleviation</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>NE/K010441/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>ALTER aims to demonstrate that there are real and lasting benefits for wide scale poverty alleviation, particularly for the rural poor, by tackling soil degradation at a range of spatial scales, from field to landscape, and using opportunities within agricultural as well as severely degraded land. Throughout the world, soil degradation impacts on the health, wealth and well-being of rural people in many different ways. Soils have a key supporting role in maintaining agricultural yields, water availability, water quality, resources for grazing animals and other ecosystem services. Some are perhaps less obvious but still valued such as maintaining habitats to support honey-bees and local wildlife. In Africa, soil degradation is recognised as a major constraint to alleviating poverty in rural communities. We have chosen to work in Ethiopia and Uganda where there are contrasting issues of soil degradation in mineral and organic soils are a result of agricultural land use but similar reliance in rural communities' on a range of benefits from soils. 

Solutions to soil degradation are not simple and require a much better understanding of how people benefit from soils, what they stand to gain if they can improve the condition of the soils that they manage whether for crops, livestock, timber production or as semi-natural areas, what they would need to do to accomplish this and what barriers may prevent this. In parallel we need to gain better insight into the likely success of different management options to improve soils. Ultimately these options will require some form of investment whether that be via money, time, resources or other mechanisms. We will investigate the relative pros and cons of these mechanisms from the perspective of local people, organisations involved with markets for Payments for Ecosystem Services and national objectives in alleviating poverty. A broader view of carbon benefits and trading is an opportunity to invest in lasting improvements in degraded ecosystems and the livelihoods of the poor that depend on these. 

All of this research and evidence building needs to be placed into the context of climate change. We need to establish that whatever might be suitable, acceptable and viable for tackling soil degradation now will have long-term benefits to local people and that these benefits will not be negated by the on-going changes to local climate. 

The ALTER project is an international consortium between The James Hutton Institute (UK), University of Aberdeen (UK), Hawassa University (Ethiopia), The Ethiopian Government's Southern Agricultural Research Institute (SARI, Ethiopia), Carbon Foundation for East Africa (CAFEA, Uganda) and the International Water Management Institute (Nile Basin &amp;amp; Eastern Africa Office, Ethiopia). This team brings together natural scientists, social scientists and economists to work together with rural communities and other local decision-makers and facilitators to improve our capacity to predict how human-environment linked systems respond to incentives and other drivers change. This predictive capacity is needed to be able to explore whether different options for change could result in substantive poverty alleviation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>ALTER seeks to achieve high impact by developing and implementing a Pathways to Impact (PtI) plan that permeates and frames the expected outcomes of all project activities. This PtI has a statement of desired change, that &amp;quot;the overarching aim of ALTER is to establish whether investment in soil carbon can be used to alleviate poverty (in addition to or as an alternative to aboveground carbon) by restoring, enhancing or protecting the goods and services provided by ecosystems in regions where soils are degraded or under threat of degradation&amp;quot;. 
The desired change as a consequence of ALTER's outputs is that soil degradation is reversed through management to achieve short- and medium-term benefits for poverty alleviation and enhance resilience of ecosystem services, whilst local, national and international capacity to invest in soil is achieved. 

The ALTER project would provide the evidence necessary for this change to be promoted by national and international organisations and to provide local people with sound knowledge of opportunities available to tackle soil degradation. We will seek to influence institutions and governance structures that most relate to poverty alleviation. These include National Development Plans and implementation of existing National Adaptation Plans of Action and Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions. 

The PtI is developed in collaboration with local partners and structured to utilise the Theory of Change and ESPAs Impact and Knowledge Strategies, whilst building on partners' extensive range of experience in stakeholder engagement and research support for policy. There are many opportunities for developing metrics for measuring impact within the project. These include quantifiable measurements of soil carbon, fertility, primary production and flow of ecosystem services leading to poverty alleviation. ALTER will implement a set of Ideals: Innovation: improving on existing practices and building capacity; Inclusion: harnessing the potential of partners, collaborators and wider stakeholders; Implementation: showing how 'good practice' works; Linkage: linking up with previous and existing projects and programmes and Legacy: creating practices, attitudes and organisational structures that outlast the project. We will utilise the PtI Advisory Working Group (see Pathways document) to develop these metrics as appropriate to each location to ensure appropriate coverage and relevance. Whilst ALTER will report to the Research Outcome System, we will also seek to monitor flow of data and information through relevant organisations and maintenance of networks to ascertain the impact on achievement of the Statement of Desired Change.

By engaging with multiple stakeholders, from local communities, research organisations to regional and national government, we will develop working relationships that facilitate two-way dialogues with those we seek to learn from, inform and influence. We will map out networks of stakeholders to ensure an efficient process of engagement that provides a two-way flow of information between the multiple research disciplines. This enables the identification of key actors and targeting of influence efforts to increase the probability of effective change. Engagement with stakeholders, both within ALTER and wider networks will help ensure that all opportunities to influence the contextual drivers are taken. This presents a logical sequence through which ALTER will achieve the desired impact across multiple scales. 
We will develop multi-media approaches designed to suit the needs of the range of stakeholders involved. Effort will be channelled through a range of communication media: Policy engagement; Linking to other projects and initiatives; Social networking and new media; Extension services; Workshops; Master classes; Local internet; Academic; Government, planning and policy. The details of activities for each of these media are provided in the Case for Support WP4.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>471842</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>SRUC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with SRUC on cognitive mapping in Uganda and soil interventions in SSA</gtr:description><gtr:id>04AB8F9B-A743-48D6-B524-2998F9E74B87</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Charissa Bosma (2014) Fuzzy cognitive mapping as a tool for analysing the sustainability of common-pool resources: An application to the Rwamucucu wetland in Kabale district, Uganda.

Land use change in these papyrus dominated wetlands has taken place over the past forty years, seeing wetland areas cleared of papyrus, rudimentary drainage channel systems dug, and soil cultivated and planted with crops, predominantly potatoes. There has been little research into the cultivation of organic wetlands soils in Uganda, or the impacts on soil carbon dynamics and associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This study used two rounds of farmer interviews to capture the land management practices on these soils and how they vary over the period of a year. Three potato fields were also randomly selected and sampled for CO2 emissions at four points in time during the year; 1) just after the potato beds had been dug, 2) during the potato growing period, 3) after the potato harvest, and 4) at the end of the fallow season. Carbon dioxide emissions, soil and air temperatures, water table depth, vegetation cover and land use were all recorded in situ in each field on each sampling occasion, from both the raised potato beds and the trenches in between them. There appeared to be a delay in the disturbance effect of digging the peat, with heterotrophic CO2 emissions from the raised beds not immediately increasing after being exposed to the air. Excluding these results, there was a significant linear relationship between mean emissions and water table depth from the raised beds and trenches in each field over time (p&amp;lt;0.001, r2=0.85), as well as between emissions and soil moisture content (p&amp;lt;0.001, r2=0.85). Temporal variability was observed, with significant differences in the means of emissions measured at the different sampling times (p&amp;lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA); this was the case in both raised beds and trenches in all fields studied, except for the trenches in one field which showed no significant difference between sampling times (p=0.55). Mean emissions from the raised beds were highest during the potato growing season (1.74 &amp;plusmn; 0.07 g m-2 hr-1 (&amp;plusmn; shows standard error)) and lowest at the time when the beds had been freshly dug (0.67 &amp;plusmn; 0.17 g m-2 hr-1). Mean emissions from the trenches were highest at the end of the fallow period (0.37 &amp;plusmn; 0.02 g m-2 hr-1) and lowest at the time when the beds had been freshly dug (0.20 &amp;plusmn; 0.05 g m-2 hr-1). As the first of its kind on Uganda's peat soils, this study has provided some insight into the use of these soils and impacts on CO2 emissions which can be used to inform Uganda's national emissions scenarios, whilst highlighting some of the fundamental data gaps which need to be addressed with future studies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Global Soil Security Symposium</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F0A9C67-BF95-43E5-AB3A-2D98D0309D68</gtr:id><gtr:impact>keynote presentation from H Black on &amp;quot;How Soil Security is Important to Biodiversity&amp;quot; at The inaugural Global Soil Security Symposium, hosted by Texas A&amp;amp;M University.

Peat soils dominate the papyrus wetlands of the south west of the country, but the areas they are found in have been increasingly converted to potato cultivation. Our research in Uganda set out to (a) document both the annual use of and changes to these soils under potato cultivation, and (b) the extent and condition of these soils across wetland systems. During our research we found it was necessary to develop locally appropriate protocols for sampling and analysis of soil characteristics, based on field conditions and locally available resources. Over the period of one year we studied the use of the peat soil for potato cultivation by smallholder farmers in Ruhuma wetland and measured changes to surface peat properties and soil nutrients in fields over that time. Farmer's use of the fields changed over the year, with cultivation, harvesting and fallow periods, which impacted on soil micro-topography. Measured properties changed over the year as a result of the land use, with bulk density, nitrogen content, potassium and magnesium all reducing over the course of the year. To determine the extent of the peat, a spatial survey was conducted in the Kanyabaha-Rushebeya wetland system, capturing peat depths and key soil properties (bulk density, organic matter and carbon contents). Generalised additive models were used to map peat depth and soil characteristics across the system, and maps were developed for these as well as drainage and land use classes. Comparison of peat cores between the two study areas indicates spatial variability in peat depths and the influence of neighbouring mineral soil hillslopes. Our work provides valuable insight into the condition and use of these tropical peat soils, which are under-researched yet highly depended upon by local communities, with wider climate impacts. Cultivation of these peat soils has implications for their future sustainability and use, and having insight into the impacts of land management on these soils improves local and national level capacity for better soil management.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at the 'Forest and Livelihoods: Assessment, Research, Engagement' conference December 2015, Paris.

How these areas are governed, in particular with access for goods and services, is key to benefiting people.
2. Improvements in soils, including soil carbon and carbon stocks, were measured from both exclosures and intensively maintained cropped soils (i.e. home gardens). 
3. Soil carbon stocks in exlosure areas are not so straightforward to measure - simply following IPCC / standard methods is insufficient since it is the &amp;quot;growing&amp;quot; of the soil that greatly increases the stock rather than plant inputs alone
4. Management of agricultural soils to increase soil carbon has significant potential but the opportunities to do this (e.g. OM inputs, cover crops, etc) are limited for a number of reasons.
5. Spatial resolution of landscape scale assessments of soil carbob stocks, soil erosion risks and nutrient leaching risks (all associated with regulating services) have been improved by digital soil mapping in the Halaba region</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>our results on the links between soils and people should be useful in developing practical options for soil management in SSA,</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>628BAED7-566F-49BF-A31D-0A3AD245097B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of the Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soil</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>36F40C15-26AA-41BE-8A7A-3F2C847D6AE7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The 24th session of the FAO's Committee on Agriculture, held in Rome on 29th September to 3rd October 2014, considered the report of the second meeting of the GSP Plenary Assembly and Endorsed the Updated World Soil Charter.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.fao.org/globalsoilpartnership/highlights/detail/en/c/253156/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NERC Advanced Training &amp;quot;Soil Underfoot&amp;quot; Summer School</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66801FC3-9C3D-4006-8A8C-8024696D7196</gtr:id><gtr:impact>22 RCUK and associated postgraduates students gained accreditation in &amp;quot;Working with Soil&amp;quot; Foundation skills in field soil investigation, description and interpretation&amp;quot; and gained wider knowledge of the multi-functionality of soils - concepts, approaches and application. 5 day intensive course at Lancaster University - run by Lancaster, James Hutton and British Society of Soil Science.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/sci-tech/news/002081/online-training-for-a-new-generation-of-soil-scientists</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Data from a household survey conducted in Halaba on barriers to adoption of soil conservation and soil fertility management.
