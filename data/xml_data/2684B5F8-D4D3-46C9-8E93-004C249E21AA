Skin: Intellegent sensing to promote self-management.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N02723X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Modern medicine has been transformed in recent decades, with advances leading to increased life expectancy and a significant number of individuals living with long term health conditions. This has, in part, been due to the development of advanced medical devices which provide a range of interventions, including respiratory support and mobility aids. Many of these devices have to interface with the body, which creates a mechanical force against the underlying skin and soft tissues. An individual ability to withstand these forces depends on the vulnerability of skin tissues, with factors such as age, vascularity and previous wounds contributing to their tolerance. Clinicians provide medical devices to match the patient needs at that time of fitting, ensuring the device is both functional and comfortable. Inevitably, circumstances and demands change with time for the individual, which can impair the effectiveness of the device and in some cases cause harm. Indeed, evidence has implicated medical devices in the development of over 30% of pressure ulcers acquired in hospitals. These pressure ulcers contribute to an NHS financial wound care burden of &amp;pound;4Bn/yr. Subsequently, many devices are discarded, thus compromising individual needs and costing the healthcare provider valuable resources.

Medical Devices and Vulnerable Skin NetworkPlus (MDVSNplus) will integrate research expertise and motivate clinicians and industrialists to provide intelligent strategies to maintain medical device longevity and patient comfort in a range of clinical settings. It brings together leaders in the fields of sensing, imaging and computer simulation to provide the necessary expertise to evaluate the impact of new and existing medical devices which attach to vulnerable skin. We aim to use these capabilities to develop a series of intelligent mechanisms, for example sensors, which can monitor the functionality and safety of devices over time. MDVSNplus will also target methods of detecting whn a device is causing harm to vulnerable skin and create an early warning system for patients and carers.
MDVSNplus will encourage new research partners by offering funding for a series of feasibility projects which are aligned with our core aims. Each potential proposal will l be reviewed by an independent innovation panel and assessed based on the clinical need and feasibility to translate the research findings to practice. Funding to the MDVSNplus will also be used to host outreach events for clinicians and end users in order to provide evidence based guidance and education on the choice and application of medical devices. The MDVSNplus will also work closely with colleagues based in the healthcare sector, who specialise in medical devices and wound prevention, to bridge the gap between research findings and the application into clinical practice.

Through these funded projects the MDVSNplus will provide innovation to improve quality of life in individuals who depend on the use of medical devices. This will also offer the opportunity for the NHS to reduce costs associated with treatment of medical-device related skin damage and their potential recurrence. It will also ensure that devices which are current being supplied can be optimised in terms of functionality and longevity, providing the best value for money. We also envisage that new medical devices and sensing technologies will attract interest from the healthcare industry to reinvest in novel medical device technologies. In order to sustain the impact of the research findings the applicants will lobby key agencies such as the MHRA (UK medical device regulator), to raise the awareness of medical device related injuries and inform legislation surrounding device design and application. Research output from the MDVSNplus will also contribute to clinical guidelines surrounding the application of medical devices and, where necessary, new standards of medical device testing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The MDVSNplus will acquire scientific knowledge and create innovative technological solutions to minimise the risk of medical device-related pressure ulcers (MDRPUs). These advances will result in novel device designs which can safely interface with individuals and meet their functional needs. The Network has been designed to maximise participation with new and existing partners through a series of funded feasibility studies. The global aim of the MDVSNplus is to bring disruptive technologies to the medical device market to promote sustainable evolution and long-term healthcare improvements. Successful impact will be provided through:

End Users and Clinicians 
Research will improve QOL in individuals by providing them with safe medical devices for managing long-term medical conditions. Improved designs will reduce discomfort and lower the incidence of injuries, thus reducing the financial burden on healthcare providers (NHS wound care costs ~ &amp;pound;4Bn/yr). Safe medical devices will also be effective for prolonged periods, obviating the need for repeat interventions. Engagement with end-users, clinicians and managers will ensure devices are adopted, driven by the ultimate goal of self-management with appropriate safe medical devices. 

Industry and the Economy 
The UK has a strong medical devices industry base, employing ~ 50,000 mainly in SME's. Our research activities are designed to enable UK plc to create devices adopted worldwide and for patients to realise the benefit of these innovations. These devices using advanced manufacturing capabilities will lead to wealth generation leading to opportunities for the supply chain and the creation of skilled jobs. 

Knowledge Transfer 
MDVSNplus will disseminate the research outputs through scientific journals, conferences and lobbying activities. Knowledge transfer will be enhanced through studentships, mobilisation schemes and collaborative funding with academia. Knowledge Transfer Partnerships will be created with indusrial collaborators to facilitate the translation of scientific advances to device manufacture. Continuous education on the potential risk of medical devices will remain a key target. 

Regulation 
MDVSNplus will support the process of device evaluation through participation on BHTA Standard Committees and by contributing to clinical guidelines e.g. NICE. Lobbying activities will target the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to advocate proportionate regulation, including approval of new technologies which ensure timely benefits to the patient. Consultations with industrialists, clinicians and academics will ensure full understanding of, and alignment with, ethical standards for device development. New devices with regulatory approval (CE marking) will be assessed through clinical trials, incorporating PPI, funded by appropriate agencies. 

Communications and engagement 
MDVSNplus will arrange innovation workshops, education days with key clinical user groups and training days with industry. These will provide evidence based guidelines on practical issues, such as attachment of devices, and strategies to manage vulnerable skin. Knowledge gained will also be available to existing local and UK events attended by clinicians such as ISPO, Tissue Viability Society. Where appropriate, proposed activities joint will be shared with other Networks, for example, the IMPRESS network whose focus on incontinence technologies has resonance with our activities.
MDVSNplus will expand the current website platform (www.soton.ac.uk/mdvsn ). A forum will be available for clinicians and end users who experience MDRPUs to conduct audits and record their findings. This data will be shared with MHRA, in an equivalent manner to that available in the US FDA website. Applicants are also in an ideal position to influence Guidelines in the US, Europe and the Pan-Pacific in the Prevention of MDRPUs.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>502895</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>An illustration of the academic, clinical and industrial members within the Network and their involvement in our research projects.</gtr:description><gtr:id>84ED8199-BD21-40F7-9000-C2180CEF02EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Useful tool to quickly illustrate links between academic, clinical and industrial members within the Network</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Network Spidergram</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.southampton.ac.uk/mdvsn/about/network_partners.page</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>NIHR WoundTec HTC</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>WoundTec HTC</gtr:description><gtr:id>5F549ED4-0D9E-4685-9AD9-F9BF79B173FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Support provided for successful NIHR paediatric call</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint networking events</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Professor Bader is Co-I of original application and has supported successful continuation of funding from NIHR.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Devices for Dignity (D4D)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Devices for Dignity HTC</gtr:description><gtr:id>A07AE5CD-CD75-45F3-A18F-6C9EBC2B5216</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Facilitations of PPI activity</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Joint networking events</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Joint networking events</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Nottingham (PLUS)</gtr:description><gtr:id>AF689FFE-C6E3-4A8F-9B5B-C5FF5696FF1F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>MDVSN funded partner project on 'Optical fibre sensing at the interface between tissue and orthosis or prosthesis'</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Named CO-I on MDVSNPLUS Award and working on funded project: Optical fibre sensing at the interface between tissue and orthosis or prosthesis</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Named CO-I on MDVSNPLUS Award
