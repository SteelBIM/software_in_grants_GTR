rural livelihood transformations in Africa.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J018090/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>How can the impact of development activities intended to benefit poor men, women and children caught up in complex processes of rural transformation best be assessed?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research sets out to develop and evaluate a protocol for impact assessment based on self-reported attribution without the use of comparison groups as an alternative to experimental or quasi-experimental designs based on statistically inferred attribution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The three year project, starting in September 2012, is led by James Copestake at the University of Bath, and being conducted in collaboration with three NGOs - Self Help Africa, Farm Africa, and Evidence for Development. It is jointly funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and Department for International Development DFID. The research has three strands that will be applied to four projects: two in Ethiopia and two in Malawi.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Strand 1 comprises a baseline and two rounds of annual monitoring of food security and income at the household level by NGO staff.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Strand 2 comprises two rounds of annual in-depth interviewing to elicit self-reported attribution from intended project beneficiaries.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Strand 3 comprises two rounds of qualitative evaluation of what Strand 2 added to the understanding of project stakeholders.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>There is continued and growing demand for high quality evidence of the impact of development activities, both in countries where such activities are taking place and in those that provide financial and technical support. In the context of some scepticism about &amp;quot;what works&amp;quot; demand from the general public is also important (e.g. Horton, 2010). 

The project aims to have an impact on methodological debates over appropriate forms of M&amp;amp;E and impact assessment at various levels: (a) within SHA and FA, and through them within the NGO networks in which they participate; (b) among other development agencies engaged in work similar to SHA and FA; (c) within academia - see note on academic beneficiaries; (d) within aid policy networks within the UK and globally - e.g. through policy forums run by ODI, 3ie, Oxfam; (e) at the national level within the two countries where field work will be undertaken; (f) among the general public. 

Positive impact on methodologies for strengthening feedback and organisational learning within development agencies and along the aid chain should result in improved rural development practices and outcomes both within the countries where the research is undertaken and potentially more widely.

There is widespread uncertainty about the effectiveness of alternative strategies and modalities for promoting household level economic security in the context of complex rural livelihood transformations: over the terms of smallholder participation in national and global value chains, for example. While the primary goal of the research is methodological, the pilot studies will also deliver more immediate and tangible benefits in terms of better understanding of the impact of the specific rural development activities of SHA and Farm Africa. These insights will impact most immediately on their own programmes in each country and more widely across the other countries across Africa where they work. They should also contribute to national and global debates over rural development strategies more widely. 

The impact of both methodological and substantive empirical findings will be maximised through networks at global, national and local levels. Given the primacy that SRA based IA places on the validity of beneficiary perceptions of change and attribution of impact, ensuring feedback and enabling dialogue within the communities where the studies are undertaken will also be important. The NGOs conducting the research will lead in supporting communities to use the information to increase understanding of the relative impact of specific development activities in their locality for different community members. This will help inform decisions and be used in participatory planning processes.

Diageo saw the QuiP as a pilot &amp;quot;deep dive&amp;quot; to explore possible positive and negative effects of their smallholder barley procurement in Ethiopia at the household level and below. We found evidence of positive impact on household incomes and education. We also found some rising inequality, due to rising land rents and more seriously negative shocks to some farmers arising from credit being advanced against poor seed.

As planned, we designed an innovative qualitative impact assessment methodology, called the QUIP, for impact assessment of NGO interventions on rural livelihoods and food security at the household level in the context of rapid and complex rural transformations taking place across Africa. The methodology was successfully tested on four projects alongside project monitoring using the individual household method (IHM) designed by Evidence for Development (EfD).. This revealed household level changes and impacts that were highly context dependent and heterogeneous.

What are the four most significant achievements from the grant? 

Achievement 1. New knowledge generated about changes in livelihoods and wellbeing in complex rural contexts in Ethiopia and Malawi, and their causes. 

Project changes over a two year period in livelihood and food security indicators were obtained for a longitudinal survey sample of 172 households using the IHM. Plot QUIP studies included semi-structured interviews with 48 households and 16 focus group discussions (four per project). The final round of QUIP studies covered 98 households, all of whom were also part of the baseline IHM sample survey. Detailed findings are summarised in working papers. For each project these comprise an IHM baseline survey report, an IHM endline report, Pilot and Final QUIP reports. The data reveals very wide variation in households' livelihood characteristics and wellbeing indicators between projects, within them and over time. They also reported on a wider range of positive and negative drivers of change during the two year period. Evidence on short-term project impact (both explicit and implicitly supporting project theories of change) was largely positive, but not always sufficient to offset exogenous negative drivers . 

Achievement 2. Development of new and improved methods for qualitative impact assessment of rural development interventions in complex contexts 

The QUIP methodology was successful in generating substantial impact evidence. While broadly based on a combination of contribution analysis and process tracing, the research has pioneered some innovative features. First, the project successfully tested the feasibility of blinding field researchers and respondents from knowing the precise purpose of interviews (beyond finding out about local livelihood changes), thereby reducing the threat of pro-project confirmation bias associated with self-reported attribution methodologies. Second, a substantial amount of work went into developing a highly transparent, auditable and efficient way of organising the impact evidence obtained so as to facilitate quick and easy interpretation and lesson learning. This entailed substantial investment in development of Excel spreadsheets and associated protocols to ensure consistent and useful coding. This investment goes a long way to reduce the 'black box' characteristic of much qualitative research. 

Achievement 3. Insights gained into implementation of mixed methodologies: how and how not to integrate quantitative and qualitative approaches to monitoring and impact assessment.

The project was successful in generating a longitudinal dataset that enables data from the IHM and QUIP studies to be combined and cross-analysed (work that is still ongoing). However, the two methods proved more complicated to integrate than hoped. While the data is useful in highlighting heterogeneity at the household level, it is harder to assess the relevance of the findings to the wider population of intended beneficiaries of the projects than hoped. Lighter touch quantitative monitoring of key proxy indicators could have established a stronger frame from which to select QUIP samples

Achievement 4. Successful model identified for building within-country collaborative relationships for impact evaluation. 

An unanticipated lesson gained from the project relates to the process of commissioning impact evaluation and building the pool of researchers available to conduct them. The QUIP studies required that a third party (in this case the University of Bath) recruits local researchers who were not known to the evaluand. However, once data collection and analysis was completed the dialogue between field researchers, project staff and analysts (which took place at country level workshops) proved both fruitful in itself and effective in forging new relationships between externally funded NGOs and local universities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings might be taken forward and used by others in four ways - indeed this is already happening.

1. There is scope for further cross-analysis of the combined data set to explore household level livelihood dynamics and wellbeing outcomes in complex contexts, including the effect of commercialisation.

2. Substantive findings from the four pilot studies have been internalised by the participating NGOs, forming part of their final evaluations to donors and contributing to future programming. More generally, the studies offer evidence in support of the potential to achieve substantial benefits from carefully tailored NGO interventions to help rural households adapt their livelihoods to changing environmental and market opportunities and constraints - the Assela malt barley project being perhaps the most clearly so.

3. Development of the QUIP has proved timely in relation to growing interest in qualitative impact evaluation as both complement and alternative to more established quantitative approaches. Interest has centred particularly on the wider relevance of our experiences with blinded data collection, and use of Excel to imitate qualitative data analysis packages. 

4. Interest in the QUIP has been reflected in substantial demand to share our experiences with researchers, evaluators and development agencies who are also exploring scope for improved qualitative impact evaluation. Conference presentations, seminars and meetings are listed separately, and have led to discussions over collaboration in using the methods with other NGOs, aid agencies, consultancies and firms (e.g. Oxfam, Irish Aid, OPM and Diageo). These are being actively pursued, both directly, and through plans to set up a spin-off consultancy dedicated to impact evaluation. The team secured additional funding to carry out further market research into the potential of the approach to meet demand in the sector. This has enabled us to meet so far with over 70 different organisations and individuals to share the results of the research, and to identify interest in adapting the methodology to suit other sectors, including microfinance, urban livelihood promotion, housing and education.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>858D4BAD-669C-43DA-B3E6-7564A5BB99FB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://go.bath.ac.uk/art</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of Programme Advisory Board of Gorta Self Help Africa</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Africa</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A32601E9-9FBA-4117-8AB6-098D5E15FFEA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing role as advisor to Gorta Self Help Africa, an Irish and UK registered development agency dedicated to improving livelihoods and food security of poor and vulnerable households across Sub-Saharan Africa.

However, as both an exploratory and confirmatory evaluation method it does incorporate some innovative features that are relevant to purer or academic social science research methods (e.g. in relation to methods to reduce confirmation bias and improve data coding). In addition to pursuing opportunities for commercialising the QuIP in development practice and among impact investors, we have also presented it to more academic audiences, and are planning applications to more academic work (e.g. through Maconachie's new project for Humanity United) on assessing wellbeing along informal mining value chains in West Africa).</gtr:description><gtr:id>8CA52382-3177-479F-8540-BF2EA0B33365</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The QuIP has attracted a lot of interest among other researchers, and been presented at several conferences (including in Bordeaux, London, Manchester, Pretoria, Stockholm) and through invited seminars (including for DFID, Save the Children, Oxfam UK, OPM Ltd, the National Audit Office and the Aga Khan Development Network).
