&lt;p>This research project investigates whether and how lay members add (and are perceived to add) value as judges in such cases. Thus it will examine the circumstances in which lay members sit on cases and their contribution, including whether there are minority decisions; success rates; and differential appeal rates (judge alone/full tribunal); as well as the views of the Employment Judges and the lay members themselves, plus other stakeholders such as representatives of the parties and key civil servants. Information on the role of lay members in other UK tribunals and labour courts abroad will also be gathered, so that comparisons can be drawn. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The methodology will involve searching the judgments of Employment Tribunals and the Employment Appeal Tribunal, together with interviews with tribunal user organisations, representatives and key civil servants, and questionnaires to Employment Judges and lay members. The findings will have significant public policy implications for what is now a key employment relations institution.&lt;/p>

added value. Specifically the surveys found:

? Lay members' main contribution derived from their provision of workplace experience, which the professional 

judges did not have and their injection of a practitioner perspective which balanced judges' legal perspective. 

? High percentages of both Employment Tribunal lay members and judges (100 and 80 per cent respectively)

 assessed unfair dismissal as a jurisdiction where lay members added value to decision making, despite 

government plans to enable judges to sit alone in unfair dismissal cases. 

? Few judges or lay members assessed lay members' contribution to the hearing in terms of the lowest score 

on a 1 to 4 scale, with average respondent scores suggesting a greater contribution at the ET than at the 

Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT). 

? Respondents broadly agreed that a three person tribunal is likely to have greater legitimacy for the parties than a judge alone.

? The majority of judges, both at the ET and the EAT preferred to sit alone at least some of the time, with small percentages always wishing to do so.

? Comparing English and Scottish respondents, two clear patterns emerge. First differences between ET judges and ET lay members overall were much greater than geographical differences, although on the whole Scottish respondents were less fulsome in their views than their English counterparts.

Most interviewees said that they valued the presence of lay members on employment tribunals (ETs) because they were able to reassure parties that two out of the three people deciding their case had workplace experience and that it 

would not just be a lawyer who would be the decision maker. As to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, interviewees

 had mixed views. Some interviewees could see no point in having lay members on a tribunal that determined points 

of law, but others held a contra- view, while some interviewees were equivocal.



The selection of lay judges to the labour courts of Great Britain (GB) is unique. First, since 1999 there has been 

self nomination to the employee or employer panel, replacing nomination by trade union and employer organisations, 

which occurs elsewhere in European labour courts. Second in GB, self nominees are then assessed by formal selection processes. Elsewhere the social partners formally or informally check nominees' credentials. Third, in GB, the

government has gradually given sole adjudication to professional judges. Elsewhere, governments have not 

questioned the role of lay members.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Public policy debate by government, Advisory Conciliation &amp;amp; Arbitration Service, Trades Union Congress, Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development.
