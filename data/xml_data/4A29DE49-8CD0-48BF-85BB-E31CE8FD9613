culture</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/I031839/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>This project brings together University College London, the University of Nottingham, which also hosts the HORIZON Digital Economy Hub, the London Borough of Waltham Forest, the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and Leytonstone Business Improvement District (e11bid) to investigate how the urban experience mediated through connected large screens can be designed to augment real world interactions, support communities, and promote and develop culture so as to maximise the quality of the public experience within the urban realm.This project is inherently cross-disciplinary bringing together methods from Architecture and Computer Science. We will work in 'action research' mode engaging research organisations with the end user communities and Waltham Forest council. We will also engage at a national level through the involvement of CABE and Mike Gibbons, Head of Live Sites (a network of permanent large-scale digital screens across the UK). Through an iterative prototyping methodology we will integrate the content development, placement, local interactivity and distributed connectivity of four re-locatable screen nodes connecting Nottingham with London. This set-up will allow us to explore remote connectivity by comparing two with three and four networked nodes, creating situations and experiences that differ in their urban settings and the types of populations they support through different seasons. The screen content will be compared across different locations, allowing us to identify outcomes that are site-specific and ones that can be generalised across different sites. We will develop the screen content (such as applications and experience) and evaluate mediated public interactions around these screens by engaging with the London Borough of Waltham Forest, the local communities around all four nodes locations, and commissioned artists in definition of the research challenges as well as in the programme of research itself. These creative experiments will, however, be carefully designed to contribute to our research understanding of the dimensions of possibility and acceptance by the community. We will document design, management and public meetings and, as research results are generated, feed research findings back into local and policy debate, and feed forward into the design of the experience and interactions mediated through connected screen technologies. Our research takes a targeted and longitudinal approach in order to understand a complex range of social, technical and interactional issues.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Non-academic impact is fundamentally embedded in the structure of the funding call and our resulting research strategy. The London Borough of Waltham Forest is the core stakeholder partner which will enable our Research-in-the-Wild driven research programme through the public deployment of the urban screen network. The district of Woolwich in the London Borough of Greenwich Council is an additional supporting public sector partner, providing research input and aiming to help disseminate the results. The project's Advisory Board will play an important role in ensuring meaningful impact takes place in an iterative process whereby the insights of the project research are fed back to potential end users and revised as necessary. Pathways to impact will be considered for the following groups: the general public as inhabitants of urban space, screen managers and curators and content creators, the management of urban space at councils, designers of urban space and planners, community leaders and policy makers, and finally the research associates employed on the grant. The general public - Inhabitants of urban space including local and connected communities: Our emphasis on participative community engagement as a specific objective based on a framework of action research will result in iterative experiments, observation and documentation to engage the public and local community. This will contribute innovatively to the current debate on the potential of urban screens for serving as an exchange platform between people in a range of cities supporting novel forms of social interactions. Content creators and Artists - people making content for urban screens: We are committed to engage Christian Nold as Artist in Residence. Christian Nold is an artist, designer and educator working to develop new participatory models and technologies for communal representation. His involvement will not only allow for creative engagement of community members, but will also provide a pathway to impact. Managers of urban space - Town centre management at council(s): The project will generate an increased understanding of how the urban experience (mediated through connected urban screens) can be designed to augment real world interactions, support communities, and promote culture. This will be achieved by embedding multidisciplinary research directly within the community. Participating authorities will benefit from learning how such screens perform through different seasons, how they work in conjunction with surrounding uses within and near to a space, and how they may be used in respect to major events either of national or local significance, such as sporting fixtures or mass participation cultural events. Designers of urban space, and planning regulators: The project outcomes will be of direct relevance to those involved in designing new urban screen implementations, whether they are designers themselves or public bodies that advise those designers. This is particularly timely as urban screens are often considered as parts of regeneration strategies for urban renewal. The Research Associates employed on the grant: The research project will have a positive effect on the staff development and research careers of the three research associates employed on the grant. Pathways to Impact are inherent to the structure of the bid as already highlighted at the beginning. In particular, we will channel impact through CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment), the HORIZON DEH offering access to over 100 commercial partners. This will be complemented by dissemination in non-academic magazines and journal as well as the attendance at relevant Urban Screen gatherings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>233914</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This annual event was held on Sunday 8 September 2013 and was organised by the London Borough of Waltham Forest.

June 2013, Sustainable Society Network+ and NEMODE Network+, ran the ?Urban Prototyping London? festival. An initiative of the Gray Area Foundation for the Arts (GAFFTA), Urban Prototyping (UP Festivals), which explores how technology, art, and design can serve as new tools for civic participation in a digital age.

The festival theme in London: Digital Innovation to create resilient environments, economies and communities. UP London explored how digital technologies can be used to create a Sustainable Society through empowering, engaging and connecting citizens tin order o create resilience in their local communities.

The significance of this collaboration can be summarised below:
+provide a unique networking opportunity with a variety of disciplines, SMEs and Start Ups who are involved in digital innovation and connected communities.
+provide exposure to our outcome during the UPLondon Festival.
+provide funding opportunity to build on the 'Screens in the Wild' project outcome in relation to digital innovation, change on behaviour and local communities.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>St James Big Local Trust</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with St James Big Local</gtr:description><gtr:id>4335EEB9-C825-49CE-A9F3-9EE7C800DB72</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>St James Street Big Local group is still in an early Stage.

These screens were installed at two locations in Nottingham, UK (an Arts Centre and an Independent Cinema) and two locations in East London (with a Business Improvement District and at a volunteer-run community centre respectively.) Each of the four nodes has a touch screen, a camera, a microphone and a speaker. This technology brings interactivity into the public realm as anyone can interact with content created for the network from the street.



The project developed a framework to tackle the challenge of embedding the screen network in the public realm and within the community. It has engaged in detailed urban analysis of flows, activities and behaviours to define the nodes' locations and to support content creation. The project then lead the development of initial experiences to provide seed content, e.g: an experience to generate music across the four sites. The project has engaged with local businesses and venues, which represent possible screen placement locations (identified through the urban analysis). The project has further engaged with local, creative and academic communities to build up a 'set' of experiences over time. These include experiences to express your mood, share photos, take photos, and to interact over video. These are run on the screen network via a scheduler, changing the content of the interactive screen network in unison with the urban flow at the various locations. The full network of four screens has been operational for more than 12 months and continues to operate beyond the end of the project. 



The availability of the network long-term has given rise to detailed insights into the functioning of a screen network in a diverse set of urban spaces. This lead to an increased understanding of how the urban experience (mediated through connected urban screens) can be designed to augment real world interactions, support communities, and promote culture:



- The project has lead to a well-understood and fully deployed network of interactive screens, including a technical and managerial support infrastructure.



- The project has resulted in multiple levels of engagement with members of the local, creative and academic communities, both nationally and internationally.



- The project has demonstrated how to operate a set of screens where interactivity is networked, combining global automatic scheduling with locally relevant content. 



- The importance of the relationship with host venues cannot be overemphasized. Venues are key in enabling the network, supporting it technically; providing a platform for community engagement and guiding content development. They are also key partners in taking the project forwards.



- Significant tensions exist between multiple venues over what content should be running and when. The project has used the strategy of scheduling diverse content over time to cater for multiple requirements.



- Community engagement is fruitful when it occurs on a spectrum between 'invited', or semi planned ('part of an existing community event') and 'serendipitous'. The project has deliberately engaged through workshops and events producing content that is relevant to specific communities. The project has also created experiences that engage passers-by in unexpected ways.



- The project has created a core set of experiences that engages people on the street, for example, to express their mood, share one of their existing photos, draw musical patterns, or to take a photo with their friends. Simple 'one-touch' interactivity enables this. Levels of local engagement have been persistent at all four nodes. However, the nature, timing and duration of interactions is largely framed through the interplay between the venue related activities; the urban rhythm and the adjacent activities taking place in the surrounding area, in addition to the affordance of the medium.



- Creating open access and understanding what it takes is challenging. More research and testing needs to be carried out on this front. 



- Creating network interactivity remains a challenge with few of the project's current experiences creating synchronous engagement with someone at another site. Some local content triggered such engagement, and longer-term engagement across sites was possible.



- The project has provided the four participating venues with a core understanding of the use of urban interactive screens throughout different seasons and times of day; the relationship to surrounding uses in the vicinity and their use with respect to major events in their respective areas.



- The project has provided an understanding of the dynamic nature of interaction spaces around interactive urban screens and people and how people relate to such screens (a typology of interaction spaces).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Screens in the Wild was funded under a Research in the Wild call and the non-academic context was at its heart from the outset. All experiences created with the network directly engaged with members of the public as users and content generators. It is only now that we are investigating more academic uses, for example as a platform for the streaming of teaching content in university outreach work or as a living lab and research test platform embedded in the local communities.



The activities conducted during the project can also be continued in a non-academic context. For example, project activities covered a number of community engagement events. This included researcher-led community engagements, and artist-led workshops. The involvement of the project 'artists in residence' allowed for creative engagement with members of the local artists' and residence community. With the right funding, such activities can be continued to enable the potential of the SITW network in future.



Impact

The non-academic context was at the core of the project and we are witnessing growing interest in exploiting the screens network by various parties.



Project activities covered community-driven engagement events, both researcher-led and artist-led workshops. These activities were culminated by the project show-and-tell event, 



The involvement of the project 'Artists in Residence' allowed for creative engagement with members of the local artists community and the residence community, which is continuing to grow, but also offered a pathway to impact.



On the content level, this collaboration has lead to a tried-and-tested experience, running on the screen and captured through non-academic material. We anticipate that the content creators will pick up these as appropriate.



The London Borough of Waltham Forest (the core stakeholder partner) has enabled our 'in the Wild' driven research programme through the support of the public deployment of the urban screen network. The e11BID (public private partnership representing Leytonstone's town centre businesses) is a strong supporter and enabler of the project implementation and engagement with the local businesses, youth and women's organisations as well as the residents. It continues to support our attempts to explore suitable business models beyond the actual research project life time.



The research project resulted in a body of critical visual and descriptive case material detailing the urban screens network and the applications and experiences developed for it. Through documentary videos (made available on YouTube) and publicly available non-academic published material (available on the project website), other content creators and artists will be able to draw on our findings and further their own project and design work.



Managers of urban space in the partner organisations and at other organisations looking after urban space elsewhere will have access to practical documentary evidence on individual media experiences, observed public behaviours and stated public responses.



In addition to the above, we have targeted conferences aimed at non-academics, such the Media Architecture Biennale 12 and Media City, TodaysArt 2013 and Urban Screens series to ensure the widest possible exposure to our project findings. Moreover, we have continued developing our national and international links through the Urban Screens Network UK, and the 'In the Wild' talk series we have establish to engage nationally and internationally in the debate around the implementation of networked screens. 



The project was invited to be exhibited in a series on digital media events such as 'Digital Shoreditch 2013' and 'Digital Futures: Urban Open Space 2013 at the V&amp;amp;A in London.



The project was also part of the street expositions at the local art festivals, such as the Art Trail 12 in Walthamstow and the council led event 'Love Your High Street 13' in Leytonstone, where thousands of residents came out to enjoy the free events and celebrate their local high street. In addition the project was an attractor in the high street during the Car Free Festival in Leytonstone 2012, and continued to paly a significant role beyond the project life time during the recent Car Free Day on 8th Sept 2013.



The project aimed to draw up with CABE (Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment) detailed best practice guidance on the technical, social, managerial, editorial and ethical issues involved in the placement of urban screen technologies. The aim was to take on a broader perspective, generalising from our case study projects. However, due to significant changes introduced in Oct 2010, CABE's role was affected, meaning that CABE was unable to be a formal partner on this project as initially planned. This has hampered the delivery of the intended best practice guidance and, as a result, we are actively working on developing a way of replacing this input.
 The project is currently exploring various models to attract commercial funding for the network and experiences to continue operating the network. The Partnerships built up during the funded period will form the basis for this. The University of Nottingham has provided the base funding for maintaining the existing screen network until the end of 2014, which will enable the exploration of these pathways. UCL has provided base funding to explore viable business models. The screen network can already be put to use to link people to explore content together in urban space, might this be educational, informational or entertainment.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>CE2FBF5F-C84D-4F2A-8F03-C2BEDE1EB966</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.screensinthewild.org</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>a design process that tackles the complex challenges: social, spatial and regulatory around urban screens and implementation of urban screen in urban communities.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CFFA4D04-C294-4F8E-93E7-64A6C29173F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A framework and a design process for the implementation of networked urban screen in urban space</gtr:title><gtr:type>Systems, Materials &amp; Instrumental Engineering</gtr:type></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/CED3B579-B885-4241-9B88-D43A465AA659"><gtr:id>CED3B579-B885-4241-9B88-D43A465AA659</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Rise of Physical-Virtual Spaces: Understanding the Convergence of Physical and Virtual Spaces, the Changing Use, Conventions and Perception of Space and Place, and its Effect on Spatial Planning</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1617036310750b7b4a6ec8d8fc802234"><gtr:id>1617036310750b7b4a6ec8d8fc802234</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Petrusevski, I.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE0CB3DE-73F0-4464-BF2F-C086D88E4BEA"><gtr:id>BE0CB3DE-73F0-4464-BF2F-C086D88E4BEA</gtr:id><gtr:title>Longitudinal, cross-site and &amp;quot;in the Wild&amp;quot;</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/03efcb14ce716c89683434181f284522"><gtr:id>03efcb14ce716c89683434181f284522</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Memarovic N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781450347495</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/49C7FFDB-A287-4AEC-8BD0-C792977DCD4B"><gtr:id>49C7FFDB-A287-4AEC-8BD0-C792977DCD4B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Human-Computer Interaction -
