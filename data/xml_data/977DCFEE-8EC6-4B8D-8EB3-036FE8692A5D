Resource patterns are typical for personnel scheduling problems and for project management; job patterns are usually studied within machine scheduling. In spite of the differences in the nature of two types of patterns and the differences in application areas for two types of problems, there are a number of complementary features in the underlying models which have not been explored in the past. Within this project, we intend to complete the in-depth analysis of the two models, perform the knowledge exchange between the two areas and develop a new methodological framework for solving problems with patterns. The study of the separate problems with resource patterns and those with job patterns will be concluded with the study of the combined problem with both types of patterns, which models new features of real-world applications not studied before.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The SRP and SJP models which we plan to study share important common features, but arise from different application areas. Historically, they were studied by two different research communities. If successful, our project will bring together the two research areas and address them in a systematic manner. Translating the results from one research area and making them applicable for the other area will enhance the solution toolkits for both problems and will stimulate the development of new methods for them. Furthermore, the project will make the first attempt to study the combined problem with resource patterns and job patterns which models new features of real-world problems not explored before.

Our research will lead to several research papers and one major review paper on the methodology of scheduling with patterns. Contrary to the existing survey papers on personnel scheduling in which problems are classified according to application areas (like hospitals, supermarkets, call centres, airports, police stations, etc.) we will classify problems with respect to the underlying patterns. Furthermore, our work on pathway scheduling and assembly job scheduling will cover application areas for which a theoretical background is still missing.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-01-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-07-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>24165</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Osnabr?ck</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Prof. Sigrid Knust and her research group</gtr:description><gtr:id>C75702A7-8273-4A7E-A258-17D3BBFA6A05</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1) &amp;quot;Complexity results for storage loading problems with stacking constraints&amp;quot;

Since publishing in 2016, our paper &amp;quot;Complexity results for storage loading problems with stacking constraints&amp;quot; has already received 3 citations. 

The project outcomes related to area (B) were presented at the main scheduling forum MAPSP'2015 (Methods and Algorithms for Planning and Scheduling Problems). It was discussed that our results are of potential impact in the area of fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. We also expect that our research will have theoretical impact in the area of optimisation with Monge arrays. They are applicable to synchronisation of transmissions in satellite communication and in other areas with underlying models related to assignment problems. 

Results in area (C) can be used in making scheduling decisions in the presence of flexible machines, capable of performing operations of different types; the corresponding systems can be considered as generalisations of classical flow shops and open shops. Our new research direction is &amp;quot;Flow Shop and Open Shop Scheduling with Pliable Jobs&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:id>230820CD-A039-45FD-947E-0F35D95FEAE3</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The following scheduling models were studied: 
(A) optimisation aspects of the storage loading problem, 
(B) open shop problem with synchronised job patterns,
(C) flow shop problem with flexible job patterns.

Model (A) arises in several practical applications related to loading container terminals, container ships, warehouses or steel yards. In such problems incoming items arrive at a storage area by trains, vessels or trucks and have to be assigned to stacks. The typical constraints are 
- only the topmost item of each stack can be directly retrieved, 
- stacks should be build avoiding future reshuffling of containers, 
- stack height is limited, 
- items allocated to one stack should be compatible (not every item may be stacked on top of every other item). 
We studied structural properties of the general model and its special cases. Besides providing polynomial time algorithms for some of these problems, we established the boundary to NP-hardness. Although the algorithms we proposed are designed for rather special situations, they can be used as building blocks for more general problems with additional features and constraints typical for real-world applications.

Model (B) arises in manufacturing with synchronised job patterns. An example of such a system, presented in the literature, is related to assembling shelf boards for kitchen elements. Another example arises in scheduling satellite communication. For the scheduling problem under study, we formulated the underlying model as a special multi-dimensional assignment problem, related to an important research area of optimisation problems with Monge-like arrays. We advanced the theoretical study of the assignment problem with nearly Monge arrays and demonstrated how our findings can be applied to the subject of our study, namely the open shop problem with synchronised job patterns. 

The problems of type (C) arise in applications which admit some degree of flexibility in relocating parts of processing from one machine to another. The jobs are given by their processing times and processing patterns (open shop or to flow shop). The task is to split every job into operations and to sequence operations on processing machines in order to minimize a given objective function. In a fully flexible model, it is allowed to perform job splitting at any point; in a restricted model there are given lower and upper bounds on the lengths of operations. The main outcomes of our study are properties, reductions, complexity results and algorithms for various versions of the problem.

The outcomes of our research in areas (A) and (B) are published in Discrete Applied Mathematics, European Journal of Operational Research and Journal of Scheduling. The results for area (C) are accepted for presentation at the 15th International Conference on Project Management and Scheduling (Valencia, Spain); the journal paper is under preparation. 

Research in areas (B) and (C) had led to a successful PhD thesis by Christian Weiss. He had his viva on 17 February 2017 and was recommended the award of PhD (subject to editorial and presentational corrections).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results can be considered as a first attempt of a systematic study of optimisation problems (A), (B) and (C).
