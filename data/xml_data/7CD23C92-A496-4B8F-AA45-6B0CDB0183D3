Thus the aim of this study is to assess the impacts of devolution on the provision of renewable energy, and address the following questions:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;To what extent has devolution affected the volume of new renewable energy being delivered in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Have the devolved institutions made different use of the powers and capacities for promoting renewable energy given to them by devolution?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What lessons can be drawn for the effective delivery of renewable energy from these experiences across the UK?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The research starts in 2012 and runs for two years. It focuses on how the devolved administrations have set targets for renewable energy, and coordinated this with national (UK) and EU-level targets. Careful attention is also given to two key sets of policy instruments for renewable energy: financial support mechanisms and planning policy.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research combines qualitative data, gathered from documentary sources and interviews with government, business and pressure groups, with quantitative data derived from data-bases of renewable energy development.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>217426</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>World Wind Energy Association bulletin 2012, December issue, pp.10-15</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B287F641-B0F3-4DD0-83E8-5581D2044AA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The article arose from my presentation and role as conference convenor, at the WWEA Annual Conference, Bonn 2012

This was stimulated initially by the DREUD Report (see 'Publications'), published December 2013, but expanded to cover wider energy issues. 

Both David and Peter gave evidence at the Select Committee of the Scottish Parliament on Economy Energy and Tourism, with Dr Toke appearing on 30th April 2014. Peter Strachan and David Toke also wrote articles for numerous publications, including the Scotsman, Energy Voice, Ecologist and The Conversation. Separate entries have been made to ResearchFish where possible. Peter also did radio and TV work with the BBC, the Turkish national broadcaster and Spanish television. Peter's work on the referendum also made the Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Bloomberg and Wind Power Monthly. Scottish Government ministers (Fergus Ewing) referred to Peter and the December 2013 DREUD report on numerous occasions.

See above. The effects of the various debates that took place in the lead up to the independence referendum have yet to be seen, and will only become apparent after the next general election.

This is the finding of a two-year research project undertaken by Cardiff University, Queens University Belfast, Robert Gordon University and Birmingham University. The collaborative project seeks to examine how devolution has affected the development of wind, wave, solar and biomass energy technologies. 

&amp;quot;The level of renewable energy capacity in place prior to devolution in 1998/1999 was low. In general, capacity has expanded most significantly since 2002-2003.&amp;quot; says Dr Richard Cowell, Principle Investigator of the study at Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography. 

&amp;quot;We can point to a range of actions by the devolved governments - especially Scotland - that have shown significant support to renewable energy in the UK. The Scottish Government has led in using its powers to give greater support to wave and tidal power technologies, while Northern Ireland has used their powers - greater than Scotland's - to facilitate small-scale renewables and bio-fuel processes.

&amp;quot;The centralisation of the consent process for major energy generation is another major factor of Scotland's success. Energy policy is executively devolved, which gives Scottish Ministers full control over major energy consents and planning - onshore and offshore - and scope to adjust the details of market support. &amp;quot;

To a lesser extent, Wales and Northern Ireland have also helped promote renewable energy. The Welsh Government's use of strategic spatial zoning has helped pull in a larger volume of on-shore wind development interest than could be expected in a comparable region of England. Yet concentration of these developments has triggered public opposition and political conflict. 

A key feature of the devolution settlement is that the devolved governments have different sets of powers that are relevant to the delivery of renewable energy development, with the Northern Ireland Executive possessing the most powers and the Welsh Government the least. 

But a key finding of the research is that the powers available to the devolved governments do not automatically determine which country has been able to make greatest headway. For example, Scotland has achieved significant renewable energy development despite having fewer powers than Northern Ireland. Several factors have contributed to this. The key ingredients of the Scottish Government's success in promoting renewable energy relative to other governments are as follows:

Time - Among the devolved governments, political commitment to large-scale renewable energy development is longest standing in Scotland, allowing debates about delivery to develop sooner than in Northern Ireland and Wales.

Political support - The centrality of energy issues to the Scottish National Party (SNP) and its independence agenda is a key factor, but so too is cross-party support, and the galvanising of a wider but still compact policy network which includes major energy businesses.

Positioning - Scotland has been more consistent over time in presenting the expansion of renewable energy as a national economic agenda, rather than just an environmental or rural development agenda.

Sites - The availability of larger, windy, but relatively less contested sites for on-shore wind in Scotland has also been a factor, and also meant more projects went through central consenting procedures rather than local planning authorities.

The research suggests that it is this cohesion and consistency of elite interests in Scotland around the importance of renewable energy - spanning successive governments, political parties and business - which explains why Scottish Governments have been empowered and enabled to make robust use of the powers available. As it has achieved successful growth in the sector, this too helps cultivate credibility among key business interests, and gives increased leverage to its position in policy discussion with UK government. 

Dr Cowell added: &amp;quot;There is a high degree of commonality between the governments in Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh over the broad direction of energy policy and the place of renewable energy within it. 

&amp;quot;With the exception of Scottish opposition to new nuclear, both Scottish and Welsh Governments have been broadly comfortable with a 'UK energy development pathway' that consists of large developments, international investment and includes conventional generation technologies. 

&amp;quot;Devolved governments have not taken major steps to increase public engagement in renewable energy development: there is positive support for community renewables but also a shared view that planning processes for major energy infrastructure should be centralised and streamlined.&amp;quot;

Professor Peter Strachan of Robert Gordon University, who led the Scottish component of the research, said: &amp;quot;Scotland has shown the high level of cohesion between top-level politicians, officers and businesses required to make the UK energy pathway work. Such cohesion around the direction of renewable energy development has been harder to find in the rest of the UK, making progress more uncertain.&amp;quot;

Nevertheless, the research does not conclude that the actions and activities undertaken by the devolved governments are necessarily the most important factors shaping the development of renewable energy in the UK. This is because devolution is still a relatively new dimension of energy governance in the UK, and decisions affecting key drivers for renewable energy investment are still made mainly in Westminster, with the Treasury exercising close budgetary control. In all areas of the UK, grid capacity expansion remains slow to achieve. The major growth in offshore wind is driven mainly by Westminster and cross-UK bodies, with the most significant capacity growth being in English territorial waters.

The Energy Minister for Scotland, Fergus Ewing, said:
&amp;quot;This report underlines the importance of the flexibility which Scotland has over energy policy, and the effective use to which that flexibility has been put since devolution. Successive Scottish Governments have taken distinct approaches where necessary - these have built upon the advantages presented by our huge renewable resource, and helped Scotland establish itself as a hub for investment and a byword for emerging renewable technologies.
&amp;quot;Scotland has hit the natural lottery twice, first with oil and gas and now with our green energy resources. We have astounding green energy potential and vast natural resources with about a quarter of Europe's wind and tidal energy and 10% of its wave power.
