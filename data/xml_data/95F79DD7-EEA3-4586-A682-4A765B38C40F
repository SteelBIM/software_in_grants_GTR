Each of these cells is a specialist that contributes through a large number of activities to the support of an organism. Cells are composed mostly of a liquid interior that accommodates the precious machinery including the building blocks of life and all the information to produce proteins. A water insoluble protective lipid layer called a membrane surrounds the cell. To function properly and also when necessary to adjust the interior workings of the cell to changing external demands the cell needs to be continuously supplemented with nutrients and instructions that come from the outside. To help with this, a large number of molecules, called membrane proteins such as e.g. ligand receptors are embedded in the lipid layer, where they span the membrane. They are the liaison centres of the cell and communicate between interior and exterior worlds to shuttle information and material across the cell-interface. Their involvement in so many complex information transfer processes and their implication in a large number of diseases have made them prime targets for the majority of existing drugs on the market. Biologists and chemists study the properties of such molecules in order to better understand the cellular and biomolecular processes. One important aspect is to understand the three-dimensional organization of these molecules. While this can be obtained quite routinely and with great success for water-soluble molecules, it is much more difficult to achieve for membrane embedded proteins using the traditional structure determination techniques of X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Consequently structure determination of insoluble membrane proteins is still in its early stages. Our proposal aims at the development of the NMR technique to solve the structure of such membrane proteins. We concentrate our studies on a particular member, for us a model system that belongs to a family of proteins with many analogies to receptors. The latter have proven particularly evasive to structural studies so far and our research efforts will improve this situation.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>A multitude of problems make structural studies of membrane proteins a substantial challenge. Membrane proteins play key functional roles and their dysfunction is directly involved in many diseases. Elucidating the structure of membrane proteins is invaluable for understanding their function. Given the extensive difficulties, encouraging advances have been made recently using X-ray crystallography and NMR in solution and solid. Solution-state NMR spectroscopy is rapidly winning importance in the study of structure and dynamics of integral membrane proteins but so far has primarily concentrated on the more accessible b-barrel porin proteins with only few smaller a-helical proteins studied. We will study a helical transmembrane protein as a representative of a wider group of key membrane protein receptors. Our immediate goal is to determine the structure of the seven-helix transmembrane protein pSRII solubilized in a detergent micelle. We will concentrate on the development of the NMR methodology required to study such large protein-detergent systems (50-70 kDa). The feasibility of our approach is backed by our recent breakthrough results achieved over the last 12 months where we show the complete sequential assignment of this 7TM receptor. In addition, we will map the interaction of pSRII with its downstream transducer HtrII. Our techniques will be generally applicable to the study of other helical membrane proteins in solution. We will use the full potential of NMR and study protein dynamics and modes of detergent interaction and assess how these are governed by detergent choice. How far the properties of functional membrane proteins in their natural lipid environment can be correctly reproduced in detergent micelles has been the focus of a longstanding debate. Based on structure and dynamics we will be able to compare our findings with the results on pSRII available from X-ray and solid-state NMR. All our objectives will be met within the grant period of 36 months.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>376498</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science</gtr:department><gtr:description>NMR analysis of the structure, dynamics, and unique oligomerization properties of the chemokine CCL27.</gtr:description><gtr:id>62FAC375-D789-4C6D-BD03-206C658EEE24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>1 Publication. doi:10.1074/jbc.M109.091108

Our work was initially delivered in form of a proof of principle study and was highly acclaimed in its reception, with responses and interest from academic research and pharmaceutical companies remaining strong throughout the grant period. Our methods are the foundation for further NMR studies of seven-helical membrane proteins involved in regulation of cellular processes and disease e.g. G protein-coupled receptors.



Publication of our major results was accompanied by a 'Research Highlights' in Nature Methods and has resulted in the dissemination of our results through the PI as an invited speaker at over ten major international conferences in the fields of membrane protein biology, structural biology and NMR spectroscopy. Three invited, peer-reviewed reviews have further resulted from this (one published, one in press, one accepted for publication).



Next to advancement in the areas of membrane protein expression and NMR methodological developments this has also lead to the expansion into novel NMR data recording and processing methodologies. The latter are universally applicable and are leading to generally substantially increased performance of the NMR equipment. 
 We advanced academic research. We created training opportunities on national/international level. We triggered technical development in new areas. We attracted the interest of pharmaceutical research, which in longer term will lead to R&amp;amp;D investment. While our results are not immediately commercially exploitable they are relevant for drug research and via novel drug based therapies will improve public health. This will lead to economic prosperity and higher economical competitiveness.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>9D7B64D3-4953-49D9-AD71-15B61D5A6CFB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Cultural</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Membrane proteins with seven _-helices are particularly difficult to study. Only little structural information on them is available. This is very unfortunate since many of these proteins are highly abundant. Located on the cell-surface as receptors they transfer extracellular signals across the membrane boundary into the cell interior. Involved in a multitude of signaling pathways they play a central role in many physiological processes. Their malfunction in particular is related to many forms of disease. Displayed on the cell surface, it makes them attractive targets for drug treatment thus gathering structural information would help to understand how these proteins function and how to guide future drug development. 



Currently, the majority of structural information relies on X-ray crystallography, which captures proteins in a static form. NMR spectroscopy on the other hand is a highly complementary technique to X-ray and it is able to uniquely provide information on dynamics as well as structure in solution. The obstacles with NMR studies of membrane proteins are the need for isotopically labeled samples and rising difficulties to achieve full structural studies of proteins with a molecular weight larger 40 kDa. Here the situation is aggravated by the need to solubilize these proteins using membrane mimics such as detergent micelles, which increases the overall size.



This work investigated into the possibility to use NMR spectroscopy for a full structural study of seven-helical proteins. 



Using sensory rhodopsin (pSRII) as a test system, a microbial seven-helical protein receptor, our research shows that by applying our methodologies NMR can now be used to study such proteins in their functional state. Our work represents a proof of principle indicating that provided adequate samples can be prepared other 7TM proteins of comparable size, such as many class A GPCR receptors might become amenable to similar NMR studies. Encouragingly, the quality of the data indicates similar studies using even larger protein systems to be feasible.



To succeed we optimized protein expression to make a range of suitably labeled NMR samples. We developed an NMR strategy, which resulted in a high-resolution NMR structure of functional pSRII; a first for a seven-helical membrane protein solved by solution-NMR spectroscopy. The quality of the structure is excellent and was validated against X-ray structures of the same protein. The protein dynamics were studied using NMR relaxation methods. These indicate that the helices are well structured but that inter-helix loop regions and residues near the bound chromophore co-factor show dynamics on different timescales. We are able to measure dynamics of backbone and side chains. 



We mapped protein-detergent interactions. The protein is surrounded by a torus of detergent molecules that covers the exterior of the hydrophobic sidechains. We assess the impact that differing protein environments have for NMR and protein stability. Further, we developed means to allow NMR structural studies to take place in more realistic membrane mimics, such as bicelles and nanodiscs. This will benefit studies of less robust membrane proteins. pSRII binds to a transducer as part of its signaling function and we mapped the binding interface to its partner protein.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Pharmaceutical research and small company bioscience businesses involved in drug development directly benefit from our proof of principle study and will be able to capitalize from our research. Primarily, our studies gather scientific data on membrane protein structure, dynamics and binding to other molecules. This knowledge is gathered to further mechanistic insight into the diverse cellular regulatory mechanisms involving membrane proteins.



Using NMR we are addressing particular problems, which are difficult to pursue by X-ray crystallography (i.e. a main structural tool) but where atomic resolution information is necessary or where the results of NMR studies are highly complementary. Our research is into generating quality, world-leading research results to enhance the knowledge of biochemistry at the level of molecular processes. Our work furthers academic understanding and is relevant for the advancement of international science.



More specifically in this project:

Only insufficient structural information on the abundant family of seven-helical membrane proteins is available. Consequently, exploiting the use of all available structural methods that can provide information at atomic resolution is important. X-ray crystallography is the main structural technique. However, NMR spectroscopy is a complementary technique to X-ray crystallography since next to structural information it can provide information on dynamics, ligand binding, conformational changes at atomic resolution that no other high resolution technique is able to do. 



Through our research we have developed a strategy and methodology, which makes the study of seven-helical proteins accessible to NMR spectroscopy. 



The methodology employed to do such studies has been made available by us in the literature and was widely disseminated during a number of international conferences. The methodologies can be applied by other research environments, which have access to the specialized NMR equipment and are experienced with studying large size proteins. 



While microbial proteins such as the one studied by us are easier to handle, studies of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) the largest family of eukaryotic proteins are a bigger challenge. These proteins are of significant physiological relevance as they function as relays for signal transmission into the cell. Central to many cellular processes they are also involved in a multitude of diseases and thus as drug targets become of medical and therapeutic relevance. A successful drug design benefits from structural information as a source that contributes towards unraveling how the molecular mechanisms of action work. Our study indicates that NMR can now be used to gather information on such difficult systems.



Unfortunately, structural studies of GPCR proteins are still more difficult to achieve on a regular basis, as these proteins are less stable, express in small quantities and are believed also to be mobile. The extensive dynamics displayed are thought to be crucial to facilitate function, where these proteins interconvert between various states that have different activities. Influenced through binding to different ligands this results in the moderation of the downstream responses. 



NMR spectroscopy has the unique ability to report on the dynamical behavior of GPCRs and on ligand binding. In the near future, the study of mobility and changes in dynamics of various GPCRs upon ligand binding will contribute towards a detailed mechanistic understanding of how these molecules work. Additional molecular information on ligand binding will also be obtained from NMR spectroscopy. It is important to understand where the ligands are binding and how the protein structures are changed. This will help to direct the development of potential drugs that aim at influencing the activity of such proteins. While GPCRs tend to bind to a range of ligands, which result in different downstream effects, intention is to develop drugs that lead to a selective rather than broadband response. Influence of potential drug candidates on structure and dynamics and how the equilibria between different protein conformations are affected will be obtained from NMR studies, thus providing priceless complementary information to push ahead the drug development with the aim to combat disease. Out of this a new generation of drugs will be developed which will make better potential use of the easy accessibility of these proteins on the cell surface. 



While academic research, pharmaceutical and small bioscience companies are the ones immediately benefitting from the potential of our proof of principle study, the long term effects via development of drugs and a better understanding of cell signaling at a molecular level will reach much further: they will be the fight of disease and an improvement of health of the general public.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>92CE7109-8430-429D-AF54-57F9878564D9</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>3D and 4D NMR data takes a long time to record.
