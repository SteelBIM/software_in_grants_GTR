Metals catalyse the reactions of life and these demands are expected to grow.

Some of the earliest discoveries, uncovering metals as vital components of proteins and not mere contaminants, were made in the UK. Today we have world leaders uncovering how cells handle metals and the mechanisms of metal-dependent enzymes. Now is an opportune moment to exploit this knowledge to the benefit of industry and society. UK businesses which will innovate with this knowledge include established world leaders in their sectors and new entrants. 

Metallo-proteins contribute to bio-energy production, bioremediation, biomedicine, synthesis of high value industrial feed-stocks and more. The metal-handling systems of cells are vital to sustain adequate metal-protein speciation in vivo. As nearly a half of enzymes, perhaps one third of all gene products, are estimated to require metals, the impact of this network will be pervasive.

Metal-handling circuits can also be subverted to inhibit microbes. The exploitation of metals and metal-chelators as antimicrobials is a form of bio-mimicry since we are now starting to discover that immune systems manipulate metal-supply to inhibit microbial growth. Indeed, many common antibiotics tightly bind to metals and some antibiotics are closely related to iron-scavenging molecules (siderophores).

Metal-supply pathways can be engineered for the manufacture of supplements such as cobalt-requiring vitamin B12 and enzymes with metallo-prosthetic groups. Talented individuals are currently scattered in different UK research communities. The efforts of biologists, chemists, mathematicians, engineers and others will be drawn together by this network to allow effective knowledge and skills transfer with industry and with the relevant regulatory authorities.

The network will run for three years with structured workshops, a large community building meeting and additional ad hoc workshops throughout the tenure of the network.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The prevalence of metallo-enzymes means that success in synthetic biology may pivot upon an ability to engineer metal-supply inside microorganisms, plants and animal cells. For example, the sustainable manufacture of isobutanol has required the engineering of cellular iron-circuits: Aft1 and Aft2 levels were adjusted to activate genes for iron uptake to provide sufficient metal-cofactor for an introduced dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) enzyme.

The abundance of each metal is controlled inside cells by sensors (such as Aft1 and Aft2) that regulate metal import, metal export, metal trafficking and metal storage systems, they also switch metabolism to take advantage of more available metals and to minimise demand for those in deficiency. Metals which form tight complexes with proteins are held at low abundance while weaker binding metals are maintained at concentrations many millions of times higher. Under these controlled conditions the metallo-enzymes acquire the correct metals.

Network members will work with the bio-processing sector to optimise metal availability inside cells to give consistent biologic quality and yield. They will develop antimicrobial-chelants, ionophores and metal nano-particles that subvert the metal-handling systems of micro-organisms, they will explore the impact of microbes on the mobility of metal contaminants in the environment and engineer metal bio-accumulation and bio-detection. Members will collaborate with multiple companies to engineer synthetic metallo-enzymes and will optimise metal uptake and assimilation into biomolecules required for bio-energy production, bioremediation, biomedicine and synthesis of high value industrial feed-stocks. 

This network will consolidate the activities of communities working on Metals in Biology and speed the exploitation of those aspects of their research relevant to industrial biotechnology and bioenergy.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The network will have diverse impacts due to the pervasive nature of metals in biology (refer to case for support). Contributions to Industrial Biotechnology and Bioenergy can be categorised under the following headings:

Metals in bio-processing
Metal-related antimicrobials
Metal circuits for synthetic biology, bio-energy and industrial biotechnology
Metals in the environment
Metal-related nutrition and supplements
Metallo-enzyme engineering for bio-energy and industrial biotechnology
Tools and technologies for metals in biology

A purpose of this network is to promote interactions between the Metals in Biology research community and non-academic beneficiaries. 

We already have over 100 members and yet consider that a major role for the network will be to disseminate awareness of the significance of the sub-discipline and the opportunities that it presents, most especially outside the confines of academia. We intend to grow these numbers especially from industry. The names on the members' lists provide an early indication of some of the many beneficiaries, in academia and also within industry, regulatory and advisory bodies. Most of these individuals approached the network to request membership and all have been re-contacted in the closing week before submision of this proposal to ensure that they wish to be on these lists (this efficiency has avoided innumerable letters of support).

Throughout the term of the award, and in response to enquiries for expertise (from BBSRC, industry, government, outreach organisations and others) the network manager will liaise with the membership to source the best individuals to provide advice. The PI and CoI are actively involved in outreach activities including the generation of press releases, and the CoI has written popular science books and contributed to BBC TV series. Throughout the network such best practice will be disseminated within this community. 

The network manager and clerical assistant will deliver communications and promote the network, support members, maintain databases, gather information, assemble reports and brochures throughout the term of the award (see work-plan). The network manager is already part of a business engagement team so will bring contacts and sector knowledge into this role.

The research emanating from funded projects will be published in open access high impact journals and oral communications given at international conferences (after adequate protection of IP where needed). The track records of the PI, CoI and management team, attest to their commitment to such forms of impact activities.

Knowledge and skills acquired as a result of network activities (by PI's and also by RAs linked to funded projects) will be applicable to a broad swathe of academia and industry. 

Crucially, the intellectual property (IP) resulting from the projects associated with the network will be protected via company/institutional innovation and enterprise offices. The network will foster rapid routes to exploitation of such IP.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-19</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-20</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>325410</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biocatalysts Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Mag-Tag: magnetite nanoparticle affinity tags for industrial biotechnology protein purification</gtr:description><gtr:id>3D5B803C-F76A-44CA-9522-26E489651B67</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project on-going</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Enzymes are protein catalysts which can perform highly specific biotransformations to convert starting materials into desired (often) complex products using mild, aqueous reaction conditions. These key capabilities are difficult to achieve with conventional catalysts, making enzymes ideally suited to the industrial manufacture of foodstuffs, biofuels, pharmaceuticals and a range of other industrial biotechnology. The current challenge to the widening the use of enzymes is the expense of producing them. Large scale industrial purification of enzymes is often prohibitively costly due to the need for expensive, highly functionalised purification resins. This cost barrier limits the use of enzymes to industrial applications where unpurified, crude enzymes are suitable, or where the end product is sufficiently prized to enable the cost of purification to be recouped. 
We propose a revolutionary, cheap, universally applicable, enzyme purification method to widen the use of purified enzymes in industry. We will use protein fusion-tag technology to purify enzymes directly from crude preparations using cheap, unfunctionalised magnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles, which can then be bulk purified through magnetic separation. By substantially reducing the costs of purification we seek to make enzymes an affordable, green and sustainable method of producing a wide range of products.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Sarah Staniland of University of Sheffield (POCMIB011)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Biocatalysts Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Optimisation of heme incorporation into a commercially important enzyme</gtr:description><gtr:id>C930B8C1-10AE-4ED1-ACAD-322EC645D5EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The aims of the project were met in that it was determined that:

The poor protein expression and truncated form(s) of the protein were unexpected outcomes and point to some fundamental problems with the expression system.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Metals as cofactors of proteins and enzymes are essential for all of life. Many metalloproteins have properties that are useful outside of the cell, for example in the synthesis of useful materials or medicines. However, to exploit this the metalloprotein must be purified with the metallo- cofactor fully incorporated, requiring a matching of protein and cofactor synthesis/insertion. In this project, the academic partners, who are experts in metalloprotein chemistry, will provide analyses of commercially generated metalloprotein samples to assist the commercial partner in solving a problem of highly variable cofactor insertion.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Nick Le Brun of University of East Anglia (BIVMIB003)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UCB Pharma</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>UCB Celltech</gtr:department><gtr:description>Proline Hydroxylases for Biocatalysis</gtr:description><gtr:id>3884F179-FA26-442D-915B-FA983CFA4BAA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Enzymes are incredibly powerful biological catalysts that already have widespread applications in industry and the home. In microorganisms they make an enormous range of natural products, some of which are incredibly useful medicines, e.g. the penicillins. One of the strategies nature uses in the biosynthesis of many natural products is to modify a common intermediate to give multiple other products, which may have very different biological functions. Harnessing the power of such late stage modification has potential to generate many molecules from a single drug candidate. Such a process could expedite drug discovery by enabling the efficient discovery of optimised molecules. However, the natural enzymes are often not suitable for such use, because they have evolved to catalyse the production of specific products. What is needed are less selective enzymes, that can be subsequently optimised to be made selective if need be.
Our BBSRC NIBB work concerned studies on a family of metal dependent enzymes that add oxygen, or sometimes chlorine or bromine, atoms to drug-like small-molecules and proteins. To accomplish these reactions the oxygenases employ oxygen from the atmosphere and iron in its ferrous form, as well as a common small-molecule metabolite, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG). Our BBSRC NIBB project principally focused on a specific subfamily of these enzymes that catalyse the addition of oxygen, or hydroxylation, to proline, an amino acid with a 5-membered ring. In one line of investigation we explored the proline hydroxylases for its selectivity towards different ring sizes and substitutions. We found that they can catalyses the hydroxylation of an unexpectedly wide range of rings, including tricyclic ring structures; some of these products are precursors for conversion into potential antibiotics. We also explored how these hydroxylases bind iron, using both assays for product formation and by X-ray crystallographic analyses of 'mutant' enzyme structures. Interestingly, we found that the proline hydroxylases can work with only two, rather than the normal three, points of attachment (ligand) of iron to the protein. These results inspired us to study metal binding by enzymes in cells (employing mass spectrometry) and to study variations on iron binding by other types of hydroxylases. In one case we found the hydroxylase can work with only one protein ligand.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Biocatalysis is a successful method for the industrial production of small- or macro-molecules and can enable production of molecules that are difficult, expensive or often impossible to synthesise. Metallo-enzymes (biological molecules that use metals to catalyse chemical reactions) are abundant in nature and are used by microbes for biosynthesis of small-molecules such as antibiotics or for the modification of biological macromolecules. The long term objective of this project is to develop and provide access to metallo-enzymes useful for biocatalysis in cells on an industrial scale. In collaboration with UCB Celltech we will focus on enabling discoveries that will support useful bio- catalysis and bio-transformations for the generation of end products or intermediates involved in the manufacture of biofuels, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, or flavours and also for the late stage diversification of tools for drug discovery (i.e. compound libraries) in a sustainable manner (i.e. Green Chemistry). There is a current lack of accessible libraries of oxygenase enzymes suitable for use in biocatalysis and little information on how their activity is limited by metal binding in cells. Our wide range of resources will allow us to efficiently explore and engineer novel methods for accessing industrial production of new chemical entities.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Chris Schofield of University of Oxford (POCMIB016)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Metalloenzyme system for Hydrogendriven NADPH recycling in pharmaceutical synthesis</gtr:description><gtr:id>B1846053-A49A-4629-829E-DAEF20D538CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Introduction. Biocatalysis is gaining increasing importance in synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other speciality chemicals, yet barriers remain - in particular the dependence of many redox enzymes on the expensive nicotinamide cofactor, NADH, and more costly NADPH. We have previously demonstrated a novel H2-driven NADH recycling system, and in this Business Interaction Voucher project we have extended this system to recycle NADPH. The project exploits genetic variants of an NAD+ reductase generated in the lab of Dr Oliver Lenz, Technical University of Berlin, which are designed to have higher affinity for the related cofactor NADP+. We have identified a suitable NADP+ reducing variant, and we have demonstrated NADPH recycling by coupling the cofactor recycling beads with a C=C bond reductase, PETNR, supplied by industrial collaborator GSK.
Project outcomes: During the project we have recorded KM values for the most promising NAD+ reductase variants and identified one which functions as an NADP+ reductase with a KM of 1 mM NADP+, compared with &amp;gt;8 mM for the wild type. Data on the affinity constants for a series of variants will form the basis for the publication to be submitted in the coming months. The selected NADP+ reductase was then incorporated into cofactor recycling beads. A nickel-iron hydrogenase oxidises H2 and transfers electrons, via its internal relay chain of iron-sulphur clusters, to the electrically-conductive carbon bead. Electrons are then transferred through the bead to the co- immobilised NADP+-reductase which also possesses a relay chain of iron-sulphur clusters for fast electron transfer to its flavin active site. Thus H2 oxidation is coupled efficiently to NADP+ reduction. The imine reductase and ene reductase enzymes supplied by GSK were examined in biochemical assays with product detection by HPLC or GC. The C=C bond reductase PETNR was selected as the best enzyme for a first demonstration of NADPH recycling. In the presence of H2, NADPH was supplied to PETNR which was co-immobilised on the beads or handled in solution, for the reduction of cyclohexenone to cyclohexanone. Near-complete conversion (&amp;gt;99%) of the alkene to the alkane was observed by GC. Thus we have generated promising results on the feasibility of coupling H2-driven NADPH recycling to a NADPH-dependent hydrogenation. These results will be prepared for publication later this year as part of the demonstration of the modularity of the H2- driven cofactor recycling system which can be adapted for operation under different conditions by varying the hydrogenase or the NAD(P)+ reductase.

Pharmaceutical companies have recognised the benefits of using enzymes instead of traditional chemical routes to make drug molecules. Enzymes generate less waste, make purer chemical products, and allow chemistry to be carried out in water rather than in toxic, polluting solvents. However, there are challenges to overcome before enzyme approaches can be widely adopted. Many enzymes only work in the presence of special helpermolecules called cofactors, which are used up during the production of chemicals. The cofactors are expensive and for enzyme processes to be economically viable, it is essential to have some way of recycling the cofactors. We have demonstrated a novel approach for recycling a common cofactor called NADH. In collaboration with GSK, this project extends the approach to a related cofactor, NADPH, and demonstrates NADPH recycling for enzyme synthesis of pharmaceutically-relevant molecules.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Oxford Biotrans Ltd.</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Metallo-enzymes for production of nootkatol, a potential new citrus flavour</gtr:description><gtr:id>97A19318-7CFC-48D1-93E9-FDDBCAA59A42</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Samples of the pure nootkatol isomers were produced and delivered to the industry partner.

Haem enzymes are involved in the biosynthesis of numerous natural products, including flavours such as menthol and nootkatone but also medicinal compounds such as antibiotics, the antimalarial artemisinin and the anticancer drug taxol. The industry partner is developing commercial scale biocatalytic synthesis of nootkatone from valencene. The academic partner will modify the haem enzyme used in this process to produce nootkatol, which is found in minute quantities in grapefruit, to explore it's potential as a novel flavour. This primer-project and the nootkatone process will underpin future collaborative work within the metals-in -biology community (1) to test strains optimised (by others) in haem production to further enhance nootkatone/nootkatol synthesis, (2) to manipulate the primary and secondary coordination sphere of the haem moiety to further enhance nootkatol synthesis.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Luet Wong, University of Oxford (BIVMIB008)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Roche</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Development of new refolding methodologies for expression of heme protein targets</gtr:description><gtr:id>401F6F5A-EF9C-4509-BDBD-8B1FCCA02E94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In this project, protocols for expression methods were developed for a range of different heme enzymes that are not readily expressed using conventional methodologies in E. coli.

For a number of complex reasons, the interactions between industry/biotechnology and academic laboratories are often less facile and less extensive than they could be, so that new (often Specialist and/or unpublished) information is not transferred fluently to industrial partners. Our overall objective is to use this project to develop new refolding methodologies for expression of difficult (insoluble) heme protein targets, and to set up an on-going dialogue between industrial and academic partners with mutual cognate interests in specific heme enzymes targets. The methodologies that we develop will open up new avenues for industry partners in cases where they have intractable (insoluble) protein targets.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Emma Raven of University of Leicester (BIVMIB013)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Kirkstall Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Novel disposable cell culture systems for microbial growth in metal-regulated environments</gtr:description><gtr:id>F1DD0981-99A4-4D30-BF5E-E05F061CA6EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This project aimed to test the suitability for microbial growth of miniaturised growth chambers (Quasi Vivo&amp;reg; by Kirkstall) that were developed for culturing mammalian cells.

Important factors include design of the culture apparatus and growth medium, which must provide all nutrients including metals in biologically accessible forms, but not in excess.

If so, the expression conditions could be adjusted in an effort to improve the metal supply to the enzymes.

A single class of enzyme was selected for analysis, a set of three variants of magnesium-dependent galactosidase. We hypothesised that magnesium's position at the bottom of the Irving-Williams series would make it likely that these enzymes could wrongly acquire a non-native metal ion from further up the Irving- Williams series, either during heterologous expression or during sample preparation. Such association with the non-native metal cofactor is likely to lead to inhibition of the enzyme activity. The project partner, Biocatalysts Ltd. supplied the PI (Newcastle University) with a set of samples of these three enzymes, manufactured over an ~18 month period, to enable a longitudinal comparison of the metal content of these preparations. Each sample was solubilised and then analysed for total metal content by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). As a positive control, this confirmed the presence of abundant magnesium in each of the preparations (the product is exchanged into a buffer containing elevated magnesium concentration prior to drying). Importantly, in addition all preparations were found to contain significant trace quantities of (in order of amount detected) iron, zinc, copper and nickel. As the target enzymes in these samples are not homogenous however, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, further analysis was required in order to determine the amount of this trace metal detected in the preparations that was associated with the enzyme. Each sample was resolved by liquid chromatography, and the resulting fractions were again analysed for elemental composition by ICP-MS and for protein by SDS-PAGE. This method allowed accurate quantitation of the enzyme-associated metal, by separating it from unbound metal ions and from metals bound to contaminating proteins. The results of these analyses were that small amounts of copper, zinc and nickel (though not iron) were found to be present on the target enzyme in the preparations. The quantity of contaminating metals varied slightly between the longitudinal samples, and interestingly also varied between the three enzyme variants suggesting possible differences in their metal-binding properties. Importantly, though, the absolute quantity of these contaminating metals was low as a percentage of the total enzyme present (ranging from 3.8 - 12.8% occupancy), suggesting that they would make only a minor diminution of the total enzyme activity of the enzyme preparations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Biocatalysts Ltd produce a number of metalloenzymes of commercial value through expression in bacteria and fungi. However, metal supply to these 'foreign' enzymes may not be optimal in these protein production hosts, so that a proportion of the commercial product is either bound to the 'wrong' metal, or lacks a bound metal ion altogether. Increasing the proportion of the enzyme that is correctly metal-loaded can directly increase profitability of metalloenzyme products.
We will analyse the metal content of samples of the metalloenzymes produced by Biocatalysts. Where metal occupancy is found to be sub-optimal, we will work with the Biocatalysts technical team to test the effect of altering the bacterial/fungal growth conditions during enzyme production in order to increase the proportion of the target protein bound to the 'correct' metal ion. We will analyse the resulting enzyme samples to determine the effect of these changes on metal occupancy.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Business Interaction Voucher in a collaboration with Kevin Waldron of Newcastle University (BIVMiB001)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Procter &amp; Gamble</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Interaction with industrial sponsor</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB98995B-CEAA-4B1E-B65D-443E578ADFF0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing and confidential</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>See above</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Regular teleconference meetings (in excess of 50 over 24 months including all forms of interaction) with industrial collaborator

Metals as cofactors of proteins and enzymes are essential for all of life, and metallo-proteins/enzymes represent a significant subgroup of commercially important enzymes/proteins. A potential problem for the use of metallo-enzymes is that their activity is wholly dependent on the cofactor (which is usually the active site at which the catalytic process occurs) and so the efficiency of production is dependent on the efficiency of cofactor insertion. Expression systems are capable of producing a target peptide up to 50% of total cell protein; in many cases, the metallo-cofactor and insertion apparatus of the cell cannot keep up with protein synthesis. This results in major inefficiencies in the production process. An obvious answer is to carefully match protein and cofactor synthesis/insertion. This can be achieved, in some cases at least, by slowing down the rate/reducing the extent of, protein synthesis such that the cofactor pathways can better keep up. However, this is unlikely to be suitable for a commercial context where achieving maximum yield is key. In 2015 we applied for and were awarded a PoC grant from the BBSRC Metals in Biology.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Metals as cofactors of proteins and enzymes are essential for all of life. Many metalloproteins have properties that are useful outside of the cell, for example in the synthesis of useful materials or medicines. However, to exploit this, the metalloprotein must be purified with the metallo-cofactor fully incorporated; incomplete incorporation results in major inefficiencies in the production process. A strategy to improve cofactor insertion is to more carefully match protein synthesis with cofactor synthesis/insertion. While in some cases this can be achieved by manipulation of the growth conditions, for example by slowing down protein synthesis, for commercial processes where protein yields are key, important economic and production benefits should be achievable through the engineering of cell factories to increase their capacity to incorporate the cofactor. In this project, the academic partners, who are experts in iron metabolism and iron-protein chemistry, propose to generate strains of E. coli that have significantly increased capacity to incorporate iron sulfur clusters and heme into a range of protein targets. These strains, together with growth protocols developed to use them to best effect, will be tested for the production of examples of commercially relevant iron-sulfur and heme proteins by the commercial partner.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We funded and administered a Proof of Concept Award in a collaboration with Nick Le Brun of University of East Anglia (POCMIB002)</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metal Circuits, Synthetic Biology and C1 Gases Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4F158262-9C4C-45FE-9EAA-15B588AE0D9F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We organised a workshop bringing together academics and industrialists to discuss research opportunities: http://prospect.rsc.org/MiB_NIBB/metals-synthetic-biology-c1-gas-scoping-workshop/
