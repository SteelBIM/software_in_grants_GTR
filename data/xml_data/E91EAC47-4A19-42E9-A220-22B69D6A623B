In addition, RHAPSODY attempts to improve the management of people with YOD by supporting their carers using an educational, web-based, interactive e-learning programme.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A multi-disciplinary team of eight main investigators from academia and industry representing the fields of psychiatry, neurology, neuropsychology, neuroscience, health economy and information systems as well as a patient and carer advocacy organisation from six countries will deliver the research. They will analyse, evaluate and compare health and social care policies and strategies (macro level), as well as needs and access to service provision and care (individual level), using documentary analysis, focus groups and qualitative analysis. Using the evidence obtained, the content and format of an internet-based e-learning programme will be tailored to the requirements of the carers of people with YOD. This method of support is particularly appropriate for the target audience in view of barriers related to low prevalence, geographical spread and reduced mobility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A pilot study will evaluate the telemedicine intervention with regard to feasibility, acceptance and cost-effectiveness in three countries.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact on policy and practice will be provided by each component of the project. The analysis and trans-national comparison of pathways to care will pinpoint the focus of strategy development for optimally supporting people with YOD (ambulatory care, respite care, special care units). The assessment of individual needs will result in extending the services of specialised institutions (e. g. memory clinics) by behavioural modification, family counselling and resource management. The intervention for carers will complement the services of patient and carer support organisations. Furthermore it will increase the competence of healthcare professionals with regard to YOD and thus foster early diagnosis and treatment.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>201321</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>69BA10B1-85FC-4B86-B96E-53B39E3FFB39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation, 'The Development of an online information and support program for informal carers of people living with YOD: The Rhapsody study'. Presented by Dr Bridget Jones.

Key objectives of the RHAPSODY study were highlighted. The presentation summarised the research and development stages involved in producing an online program of information for family carers who provided support for someone diagnosed with young onset dementia. Common service and support needs of carers from six countries (England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden) were evident from early research phases. The challenges of developing an online program in German, English and French were discussed. The protocol for a randomised controlled pilot study to evaluate the program was presented. The presentation provoked discussion among the multidisciplinary audience about the particular needs of younger people living with dementia, including physiological differences and the broader family impact.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young Dementia Network Video (Young Dementia UK)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A27CFE41-A4BE-419D-876A-BCF9AFF191CF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A brief video recording / comment on the value of research into young onset dementia (Dr Bridget Jones).

(Delivered by Dr Bridget Jones.) Some students had worked (or still worked part time) in clinical or care environments and the module was scheduled in the semester before work-experience placements.

The session started with an overview of dementia and considering the differences between dementia diagnosed at older age and young-onset dementia. The broad implications of diagnosis, family impact, health economic aspects and service needs and provision were considered. The RHAPSODY research project provided a basis for discussing approaches to research and the online program was demonstrated. Students discussed and evaluated the program from the perspective of information provision and they considered the potential value of the program from the perspective of carers. There was lively discussion, sharing of experiences and debate on all aspects of dementia, care provision and the service and support needs of different groups.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Fronto-Temporal Dementia Conference (Munich)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D430BC34-14BD-46C8-8DA8-1CA023F7C840</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster presentation on 'Service needs in Young Onset Dementia: How 'closest' relatives balance being a carer, being a care manager and meeting their own needs'. Presented by Professor Jan Oyebode.

The poster provided background information on the RHAPSODY project and the aim of developing an online information and support program for family carers. Findings from focus groups conducted in the UK highlighted the experiences of relatives providing care for someone close to them who was diagnosed with young onset dementia. Three key aspects of the participants' discussion were, firstly, a focus on providing support and care, secondly, fulfilling an essential care manager role and, thirdly, not necessarily recognising their own needs. The presentation raised awareness of carers' circumstances, the effort involved in supporting someone with young onset dementia, and the lack of appropriate services. Conference delegates had the opportunity to ask questions and discuss the on-going research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.icftd2016.de/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Young Dementia UK: Different Impact Positive Solutions (Conference, Birmingham)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6A6465BF-6C9B-4860-A468-BA50D883B407</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Oral presentation, 'RHAPSODY - an international study to improve care for people with young onset dementia by supporting their carers'. Presented by Professor Jan Oyebode and Dr Bridget Jones.

The presentation outlined the objectives of the Rhapsody project and emphasised the mixed-methods approach. In-depth interviews and focus groups provided insight into carers' experiences and the difficulties they faced due to the lack of age-appropriate information. Findings from these early studies provided the basis for developing an online information program. The process of developing the program in English, German and French was explained. The protocol for a pilot study to evaluate the program was presented and the vital contribution of carers as participants at every stage in the research was highlighted. The presentation provoked extensive comments and discussion about individual experiences.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Patients, carers and/or patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There are several stages to this project and six countries are involved: England, France, Germany (lead), Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden. Early work reviewed information available on young onset dementia (YOD) for patients and carers in each country, providing an overview of the amount, type and content of information. A cross-country analysis was completed in England and a paper was submitted to Patient Education and Counseling journal. Reviewers' comments are currently being addressed in preparation for invited re-submission for publication. A parallel search for policies, guidance and standards on management of YOD for health professionals was undertaken and findings are being compiled for a draft paper to be submitted to a leading journal. Data collected on information guided the development of an online information resource (work package 4). The multi-media online program for family carers was completed in German, French and English. Volunteer carers were recruited to evaluate the usefulness and acceptability of the online progam and the data from this pilot study is currently being processed and analysed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As outlined in the summary of the research findings to date, the data collected on information sources for patients and carers has informed the development of the online information resource (work package 4). Findings from the focus group study contributed to the pilot study protocol and measures used in work package 5. 

The online resource for carers has been piloted and data are currently being analysed. Results and qualitative feedback from this pilot study will indicate how and where the program should be refined. It is expected that the program will then be made widely available to people with YOD and their carers through support organisations, such as the Alzheimer's Societies in Europe.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E9E861E1-9BEF-42B5-9793-4D0901499E10</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2A5C363B-05E8-411A-BF37-30FB4D367892"><gtr:id>2A5C363B-05E8-411A-BF37-30FB4D367892</gtr:id><gtr:title>RHAPSODY - Internet-based support for caregivers of people with young onset dementia: program design and methods of a pilot study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International psychogeriatrics</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/0efe02fcf137ba739aff63d621a9a4e4"><gtr:id>0efe02fcf137ba739aff63d621a9a4e4</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kurz A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1041-6102</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C6C57183-93D0-4879-961A-D9E94A04564D"><gtr:id>C6C57183-93D0-4879-961A-D9E94A04564D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Service needs in young onset dementia: How 'closest' relatives balance being a carer, being a care manager and meeting their own needs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Neurochemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d26108a5e16ceebe0094409101180b01"><gtr:id>d26108a5e16ceebe0094409101180b01</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Oyebode, J.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AF7BBB24-0723-4336-A221-A72CDEA0A576"><gtr:id>AF7BBB24-0723-4336-A221-A72CDEA0A576</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Development of an online information and support program for informal carers of people living with YOD: The Rhapsody study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinsonism</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4e24b3b122a2587415eb33049309a1cf"><gtr:id>4e24b3b122a2587415eb33049309a1cf</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Jones, B on behalf of the RHAPSODY research group</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/L008866/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6723A70B-A523-40AB-9740-B6AD2A0677B7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Medical &amp; health interface</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>ACFABADE-E54A-4FC7-B9F5-259A19D97CDB</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>3C193D18-12BD-4B15-8347-037BA623E0FF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Mental Health</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>13B8FF54-243A-4AFA-9EE2-F6869124F305</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Work with Adults</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
