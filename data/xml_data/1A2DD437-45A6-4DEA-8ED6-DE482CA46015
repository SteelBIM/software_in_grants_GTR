project is to answer three questions about the role of churches and other faith groups in helping to spot early signs of violence and stop it from happening.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>what is&amp;nbsp;distinctive&amp;nbsp;about faith-based approaches and what makes them different from the activities that are carried out by people who are not working from a faith point of view&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what are the&amp;nbsp;dilemmas&amp;nbsp;that emerge when faith groups get involved in trying the prevent violence and what possible tensions can we foresee with people who do not share their beliefs&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>what&amp;nbsp;scope&amp;nbsp;is there for improving the work that churches and faith groups do to help prevent violence and what changes do we need to make for this to happen.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will help us to know more about the work taking place, helping churches and their partners to plan effectively. Activities to ensure that the research makes a difference include a high-level meeting of people from the church, government and charities hosted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, sessions with Bishops in the House of Lords and the production of a set of resources on conflict prevention for church-goers in conflict areas.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research project has the potential to make a significant demonstrable impact and provide tangible benefits for our user-beneficiaries. 

Who will benefit from this research?

Our primary users are key offices within the Anglican network of churches which provide leadership and support to churches in conflict-affected areas. Around 80 million Anglican live in 165 countries worldwide, with the vast majority in developing countries in the global south and many in countries which are conflict-affected. Another user groups we target are policymakers engaged in agenda setting on conflict transformation, particularly those in UK government agencies working overseas who have expressed their interest in this area of work, notably the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence. A final user group are practitioner and academics working and researching in the conflict prevention field. 

Our wider circle of beneficiaries includes Anglican churches in conflict-affected communities and broader populations in places where they do or may engage in conflict prevention activity. Particular beneficiaries include faith groups and populations in Nigeria and Solomon Islands, where extensive evidence-based analysis will be conducted. Where churches at grassroots level change their activity as a direct result of the capacity building materials to be provided by the Anglican Alliance, we also consider them as an additional user group. 

How will they benefit from this research?

Ultimately, we expect that this research will contribute towards building the body of knowledge and tools which provide pathways to resolving conflict situations before they become violent. Where successful conflict prevention and early response mechanisms are able to deescalate conflict situations, the serious social harms that violence brings can be avoided. Damage to economies, infrastructure and social relations can be successfully avoided. Rather than being diverted towards war and conflict, resources can be used for provided public services and improving quality of life. This is the overall purpose of conflict prevention activity, and our expectation is that by researching the scope for new community actors like faith groups to mainstream conflict prevention in their work we can expand the range of contributors to conflict prevention enterprises. 

Our particular user and beneficiary communities will benefit in specific ways. The Anglican network of churches will benefit from evidence-based insights regarding the distinctiveness, dilemmas and scope of faith-based conflict prevention activities. This responds directly to a call made by the church to build its conflict prevention capacity during a series of global consultations in 2011. The UK government will also benefit from our insights, as this research project works at the intersection of two key priorities highlighted by UK government agencies working overseas: to ramp up conflict prevention activity and to engage more with faith groups in delivering development goals. Finally, the academic community will benefit from our research in an area where there is currently a clear knowledge gap. 

The immediate impacts of this research project will be generated through our impact generation activities, a programme of activities designed to engage with senior leaders and influence their decision making (see pathways to impact for a full plan). However, we also expect other benefits to accrue over the longer term as changes in policy and programming begin to yield results.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-11-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-11-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71189</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Office of the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with global Anglican and other faith-based development partners</gtr:description><gtr:id>C175F504-0B0A-4DE5-B709-4B15EB7F8D54</gtr:id><gtr:impact>- completion of research visits in Nigeria and Solomon Islands

In this context it has started to produce impact and we expect to build significantly in coming years. 

The project has begun to transform the way that national churches in 10 conflict-affected countries understand broader issues of conflict prevention. They have begun to recognise their existing activities as having preventative value, and to consider the ways in which they can link in with the wider conflict prevention agenda. Faith groups in Nigeria and Solomon Islands, with whom we have jointly conducted research visits and workshops, have benefited significantly from the evidence-base that has been created. In the Solomon Islands the renewed the confidence of Anglican Church of Melanesia to engage with peacebuilding and wider governance issues has revived efforts to establish the region's first Melanesian Peacebuilding Centre. This comes at a critical moment in the country's post-war history, as the Regional Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) scales down in anticipation of withdrawal, and involvement in the research has helped to secure offers of external support. 

Likewise, the project has highlighted to secular and governmental agencies in the UK and elsewhere the crucial role faith groups play in building peace and the urgent need to partner with them when opportune moments arise. We better understand the apprehensions of donors as well as their general desire for secular/religious collaboration, and we believe there will be significant openings to explore and pilot new forms of partnership as we continue our impact generation. Finally the project has played a significant role in building a network of churches, non-church agencies and academic researchers, which have committed to continue and expand this work far beyond the initial one year of the funded project.

So far we have engaged the following potential beneficiaries:

1/ Nigeria: 249 respondents from 30 organisations (faith-based organisations, non-government organisations, security forces and government agencies).
2/ Solomon Islands: extended sessions and overnight visits with 20+ senior leaders from the faith, government and diplomatic community. 
3/ Pakistan, South Sudan, DRC, Kenya, South Africa and USA: a total of 10 senior faith leaders who attended the international consultation in Coventry and London, UK. 
4/ UK: 30+ organisational representatives from the government and policy communities, third sector and academia who attended the afternoon conference concluding the international consultation. 
5/UK: DfID conflict advisers from around the world - organised a half day session on faith-based conflict prevention as part of a DfiD-organised training programme on engaging faith communities.
6/ US (Washington and New York) 30+ organisational representatives from the government and policy communities, with private briefings and round table sessions. 
7/ Global - advocacy from Most Rev'd Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury. This includes convening a debate in the UK's House of Lords on 'Soft Power and Non-Military Options in Preventing Violent Conflict' and giving a keynote lecture on 'How do we Build Communities of Trust and Peace?'

KEY FINDINGS:
1/ Many faith groups are delivering relevant and impactful conflict prevention projects, but may not necessarily frame this in terms of 'prevention'. Different terminology may mean that faith-based projects do not get access to opportunities (e.g. for funding or consultation). Faith-based forms of conflict prevention often get overlooked within the field, with lost opportunity costs in research, policy and practice.
2/ 'Conflict prevention' includes work that is preventative in effect even if not by design. Researchers, policymakers and practitioners often only include activities that are specifically designed as prevention projects within their understanding of 'conflict prevention'. In reality these represent a fraction of the activities that are effectively preventative. Again this constrains our understanding of prevention and has lost opportunity costs.
3/The starting point for preventing violent conflict should be to consult with local people about what the risks of violence are - what keeps them awake at night? A lot of time, energy and resource are expended countering political violence and instability. Early warning and response platforms monitoring indicators of violence are a step forward from reactive approaches to addressing conflict and can show real results. But they are the tip of the iceberg in tackling violence that affects people's day-to-day lives. Programmes countering violent extremism can also have value, but they are rarely rooted in addressing the long-term drivers of conflict and are often more about the security needs of foreign countries. We believe the starting point for conflict prevention should be to understand what forms of violence are most pervasive and problematic in the community. This might be violence associated with crime, cultural violence or violence in the home. 
3/ Faith groups are architects of their own approaches, not just implementers. Faith groups have their own approaches to conflict prevention based on local culture and local lived religious experience, and drawing on their faith-based values. These are often locally appropriate, effective and efficient. However in many partnerships faith groups are seen as sub-contractors, translators of secular tools and/or gatekeepers. We found that faith-based initiatives were at their best when they built on their own firm foundations, and when they were enabled to play to their faith-based strengths. They sometimes struggled when they attempted to fit into a mould designed by secular donors. 
4/ Technology is an important amplifier in conflict prevention, but it can't replace motivation, relationship or trust. The excitement around technology's potential in peacebuilding stems from increasingly affordability and the transformative impact that it has had elsewhere. However we stress the importance of focusing on the appropriate use of technology based on whatever the current prevailing norm is. At best technology is an amplifier of messages - and a non-selective amplifier at that. It cannot replace the importance of relationship in building trust and peace, and motivation remains key in addressing root causes of conflict. 

Other achievements:
1/ Full engagement of faith-based and secular partners in research design and discussion of findings, forming a network of contributors in the research process. This is underpinning significant impact-focused activity in 2015.
2/ Successful linking of grassroots agencies in conflict-affected countries with institutions concerned with conflict prevention. We invited representatives of faith groups from Kenya, Nigeria, Solomon Islands, Pakistan, South Africa, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and USA to a three-day workshop and consultation held in Coventry and in Lambeth Palace, London, at the invitation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, from 5 to 7 November 2014. They met with more than 50 senior leaders and representatives, including government MPs, interfaith leaders, development agencies and peacebuilding/conflict prevention specialists.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our main partners were Anglican churches in conflict-affected areas. Church leaders noted that they wish to introduce training on conflict prevention at different levels in their local church communities, and further develop their links with local, national and international partners in conflict prevention. Since the Archbishop of Canterbury has highlighted reconciliation as a key priority, such issues are likely to be mainstreamed.
Our workshop hosted UK agencies including Tearfund, Christian Aid, Islamic Relief, Concordis International, Conciliation Resources, and the Tony Blair Faith Foundation, as well as MP's working on peace and development issues. We evidenced a growing awareness that faith groups and faith-based organisations are legitimate partners in conflict prevention work, despite a traditional reluctance to provide funding to non-secular organisations. We believe further mutual understanding between faith-based agencies and secular institutions is vital, and we are actively exploring opportunities to pursue this within the context of DfID's Faith Partnership Principles.
Thirdly, churches and other faith groups in countries with a long history of violent conflict have much experience and expertise in conflict prevention. We believe their skills and insights should be shared with UK religious and secular institutions, in the current climate of religious tensions and conflicts.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E413E499-535B-41A1-AB53-CCB2760757AE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>JLI agenda setting</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>290BDA75-2152-4261-8B08-6BAB28BF5611</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In 2016 a working paper emerging from this project was published by the Joint Learning Initiative on Faith and Local Communities.
