In Britain, election turnout, party membership, and trust in politicians are all declining. This worries governments who respond with policies to renew democracy. But such policies have struggled because the causes for such disenchantment and disengagement are not clear. Relationships between measures of political participation and numerous other variables, from levels of political corruption to levels of social capital, have been explored. But few clear patterns have emerged. Missing from research to date on this topic are the voices of citizens, in which can be found their shifting understandings, expectations, and judgements regarding politics and politicians.

The overall aim of the proposed study is to understand better what and how British citizens have thought about formal politics since the late 1930s (when relevant datasets begin). This overall aim translates into three objectives: 1) to establish the range of popular understandings of politics among British citizens; 2) to establish changes in prominence of certain popular understandings over time; and 3) to suggest causes for these changes.

To achieve these objectives, three interconnected stages of research will be completed:
1. A contextual review of relevant and existing survey data will be used to establish broad trends, fluctuations, and cycles of public opinion regarding formal politics. Sources to be consulted, some of which date back to 1937, include Gallup poll results, National Opinion Poll results, and Ipsos-MORI results.
2. Analysis of qualitative data found in the Mass Observation Archive. On eight occasions between 1945 and 2010, hundreds of Mass-Observation panellists were asked to write about politicians, elections, and political parties. Responses will be analysed for displays of shared understandings of politics in British society at particular historical moments.
3. Integration of findings from the historical research - stages 1 and 2 - with relevant contemporary research including work from the last decade involving the ESRC and the Hansard Society seeking to audit political engagement in twenty-first century Britain.

Potential benefits for politicians, political parties, civil servants, social scientists, and, ultimately, citizens include: a better knowledge of various popular understandings of formal politics and how these have changed over the decades; a better understanding of how people think and act - and come to think and act - in relation to formal politics; a better understanding of the historical specificity and, related to that, the likely causes of current disenchantment and disengagement from formal politics; a set of evidence-based reform options in the field of democratic renewal; and, ultimately, if such reform options are taken up, the increased engagement of citizens with the democratic process, and more legitimate and effective government.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We expect direct users to include: politicians, political parties, and civil servants, all of whom desire to understand more about current disenchantment with formal politics and how to improve current democratic engagement; and political scientists, historians, and human geographers, many of whom desire to know more about popular understandings of formal politics, whether and how they change over time, and their relationship to political participation.

We expect these direct users to be mostly UK-based - at the national, devolved, and local scales - since the data relate to British politics and citizens only. But we expect indirect users to include similar groups in countries experiencing similar problems with trust in formal politics (e.g. the USA).

We also expect indirect users to include citizens in the UK and elsewhere, since ultimately the project aims to give ordinary citizens a voice in debates about democratic renewal, and to address their alienation regarding formal politics.

One short-term impact will be the provision of new data to scholars. Here, a special Mass-Observation directive will be funded by the project. It will ask Mass Observation's panel of volunteer writers to share details of their practices and thinking regarding politicians, political parties, political positions and policies, and elections. The data will be available to all interested scholars via the Mass Observation Archive at the University of Sussex.

But we expect short-term impacts to be mostly conceptual in character. We aim to provide the users listed above with a better knowledge of various popular understandings of formal politics and how these have changed over the decades; a better understanding of how people think and act - and come to think and act - in relation to formal politics; and a better understanding of the historical specificity and, related to that, the likely causes of current disenchantment and disengagement from formal politics.

We expect medium-term impacts to be mostly instrumental in character. Based on public discussions informed by the empirical research (see Pathways to Impact document), we aim to provide the users listed above with reform options in the field of democratic renewal.

We also expect long-term impacts to be mostly instrumental in character. Reform options, if taken up, could lead to increased engagement of citizens with the democratic process, including increased election turnout, increased party membership, and increased reported-trust in politicians. Ultimately, such attitudes and behaviours are thought to be important for legitimate and effective government, and so for those areas of life in which government plays a significant role (e.g. economic regulation and provision of public services).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194864</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Report launch at Westminster</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B69016C6-5725-46C9-B857-0C03C6770653</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The title of the event was 'The rise of anti-politics in Britain'.

They are publically available at the Mass Observation Archive, Brighton.

We have confirmed that no democratic 'golden age' existed in Britain immediately after the Second World War. During the late 1940s and early 1950s, commercial polling data and volunteer writing for Mass Observation indicate that substantial proportions of the population disapproved of governments and prime ministers, thought politicians to be out for themselves and their party, associated political campaigning with vote-catching stunts and mud-slinging, and imagined politicians to be self-serving gas-bags.

We have established that, despite this baseline, there has been a rise of anti-political sentiment in Britain over the last six decades. According to survey research by numerous organisations, along with qualitative data archived by Mass Observation, this rise has taken three forms. Anti-politics has increased in social scope, in that more and more citizens have disapproved of governments and prime ministers, and judged politicians to be out for themselves and their parties. Anti-politics has also increased in political scope, in that citizens have held more and more grievances regarding formal politics. In the immediate post-war period, they judged politicians to be self-serving and not straight-talking. In the current period, they judge politicians to be those things but also: out of touch; all the same; a joke; and beneficiaries of a broken and unfair system. Third, anti-politics has increased in intensity. Citizens have disapproved and held grievances more and more strongly. We see this in the language used by Mass Observation panellists, which was not generally deferential in the mid-twentieth century, and is not generally angry in the early twenty-first century, but which did go through such a change in the case of politicians and the institutions of formal politics.

Analysing polling data, we have confirmed that anti-political sentiment is associated with support for populism. In Britain, negative feeling towards the institutions of formal politics predicts support for UKIP to an equal degree as key social demographics.

Anti-politics is a complex phenomenon likely to be explained by multiple factors. Comparing writing for Mass Observation in the mid-twentieth century and the early twenty-first century, we have suggested two potential explanations for the rise of anti-politics in Britain. First, citizens images of 'the good politician' have changed. They have become more multi-faceted, less coherent, and consequently more difficult for politicians to achieve. Second, these images have become more difficult for politicians to achieve especially by current forms of political interaction. With the mediatisation of politics and the professionalisation of political campaigning, this political interaction between citizens and politicians has also changed, making it more difficult for politicians to perform virtues to citizens and for citizens to calibrate judgements of politicians.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have published our findings for academic audiences in journal articles and one book, and have plans for a second book. We see three main ways for academics to take forward our findings. The descriptive findings for the case of Britain could be compared with other cases. The explanatory findings, generated as suggestions from inductive analysis of qualitative materials, could be tested by more deductive and quantitative research. Third, if we have established that anti-politics has been on the rise in the UK for the last six decades, then more research is needed on the consequences of this development.

We have communicated our findings to non-academic audiences in blogs, newspaper articles, radio and television interviews, talks at Westminster and elsewhere, and policy briefings. We see three ways for politicians, parties, and journalists to take forward our findings. Citizenship education could be supported - especially where it focused on criteria for judging politicians and images of 'the good politician'. The specific grievances of citizens could be addressed by reforms to MPs' pay and expenses, campaign finance, lobbying, candidate and leader selection, electoral reform, and proportional representation. Third, politicians could speak with citizens more directly and journalists could facilitate this.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D23C9643-F4EE-4F7C-8C02-B6A3C6A3CECE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://antipolitics.soton.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in House of Commons Briefing Paper</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8F373606-B465-473A-A479-490A7E83E773</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7501</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The project commissioned a Mass Observation Directive on politics.
