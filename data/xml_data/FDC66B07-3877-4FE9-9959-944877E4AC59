Things</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/N02334X/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Today we use many objects not normally associated with computers or the internet. These include gas meters and lights in our homes, healthcare devices, water distribution systems and cars. Increasingly, such objects are digitally connected and some are transitioning from cellular network connections (M2M) to using the internet: e.g. smart meters and cars - ultimately self-driving cars may revolutionise transport. This trend is driven by numerous forces. The connection of objects and use of their data can cut costs (e.g. allowing remote control of processes) creates new business opportunities (e.g. tailored consumer offerings), and can lead to new services (e.g. keeping older people safe in their homes).
 
This vision of interconnected physical objects is commonly referred to as the Internet of Things. The examples above not only illustrate the vast potential of such technology for economic and societal benefit, they also hint that such a vision comes with serious challenges and threats. For example, information from a smart meter can be used to infer when people are at home, and an autonomous car must make quick decisions of moral dimensions when faced with a child running across on a busy road. This means the Internet of Things needs to evolve in a trustworthy manner that individuals can understand and be comfortable with. It also suggests that the Internet of Things needs to be resilient against active attacks from organised crime, terror organisations or state-sponsored aggressors. 

Therefore, this project creates a Hub for research, development, and translation for the Internet of Things, focussing on privacy, ethics, trust, reliability, acceptability, and security/safety: PETRAS, (also suggesting rock-solid foundations) for the Internet of Things. The Hub will be designed and run as a 'social and technological platform'. It will bring together UK academic institutions that are recognised international research leaders in this area, with users and partners from various industrial sectors, government agencies, and NGOs such as charities, to get a thorough understanding of these issues in terms of the potentially conflicting interests of private individuals, companies, and political institutions; and to become a world-leading centre for research, development, and innovation in this problem space. 

Central to the Hub approach is the flexibility during the research programme to create projects that explore issues through impactful co-design with technical and social science experts and stakeholders, and to engage more widely with centres of excellence in the UK and overseas. Research themes will cut across all projects: Privacy and Trust; Safety and Security; Adoption and Acceptability; Standards, Governance, and Policy; and Harnessing Economic Value. Properly understanding the interaction of these themes is vital, and a great social, moral, and economic responsibility of the Hub in influencing tomorrow's Internet of Things. For example, a secure system that does not adequately respect privacy, or where there is the mere hint of such inadequacy, is unlikely to prove acceptable. Demonstrators, like wearable sensors in health care, will be used to explore and evaluate these research themes and their tension. New solutions are expected to come out of the majority of projects and demonstrators, many solutions will be generalisable to problems in other sectors, and all projects will produce valuable insights. A robust governance and management structure will ensure good management of the research portfolio, excellent user engagement and focussed coordination of impact from deliverables.

The Hub will further draw on the expertise, networks, and on-going projects of its members to create a cross-disciplinary language for sharing problems and solutions across research domains, industrial sectors, and government departments. This common language will enhance the outreach, development, and training activities of the Hub.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Privacy, Ethics, Trust, Reliability, Acceptability, and Security in the Internet of Things, (&amp;quot;PETRAS&amp;quot;), concerns us all. Being able to understand, control, and exploit their interaction in this space will have huge societal, economic, and third sector impact - let us mention personalised healthcare, better transport experience, more effective energy and water supply, more robust facility and supply chain management, new economic mechanisms for data sharing, and trust relationships of particular interest to the third sector. 

The Hub's strategic focus is on co-designing solutions in this socio-technological space that are acceptable to their users and that judiciously, if not optimally, trade off conflicting considerations such as security and cost-effectiveness. The Hub will create and provide an environment in which researchers, users, and partners from multiple sectors can bring together expertise, experiences and experimental environments to engage in such co-design. This approach has impact and effective value generation at its core: the Hub has already secured pledges of considerable funding from partners who provide this support for research with impactful outputs; also, the Hub's overall strategy, governance structure, and operational oversight are designed to nurture and evaluate impact and productivity -generating activities - as reflected, for example, in the criteria for internal project selection in the initial and future internal calls. 

One large environment for impact creation will be The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Within it, the &amp;quot;Smart in the Park&amp;quot; initiative - led by UCL and partnered with The Mayor of London's Smart London Board - has provided full and open research access to the study of PETRAS aspects of the entire site infrastructure: from waste and water through to energy, lighting, smart homes, future retail, and the logistical complexity of 9.5 million annual visitors across the 257 acres site. The pathways from this research to impact are 6-monthly &amp;quot;Smart in the Park Events&amp;quot;, and IoT Weekenders linked to the Future Cities Catapult and the Digital Economy Catapult to showcase research. Additionally, workshop space for PETRAS R&amp;amp;D will be provided to SMEs, think tanks, and innovation incubators within a planned long-term IoT showcase called &amp;quot;The Heart of the Park&amp;quot;. All this will be enhanced by facilities that engage citizens with PETRAS and the Internet of Things, such as controlling park lighting via the Internet of Things. We will have similar impact activities for other demonstrators such as the Smart Streets in Lancaster, Wearable Devices in Healthcare in London, the Smart Campus in Surrey, and the Edinburgh Festival. 

The Hub will have two full-time Impact Champions serving in key management roles of the Hub; they will ensure that our approach to impact will be agile to allow the Hub to learn from seed projects, and will be inclusive to support an innovative environment in which also disruptive research and development can flourish. Through its linked, nationwide network of experimental environments, exhibition spaces and showcases the Hub will foster impact generation through co-innovation such that outputs have global reach and will help to secure the UK as a world-leader in PETRAS research in the Internet of Things.

PETRAS aspects of the Internet of Things are clearly visible to the general public, policymakers, and decision makers. Therefore, the Hub will maintain and lead a dialogue with those groups and others regarding the importance of PETRAS aspects in our future lives. This is aimed to be high profile, aided by a professional media campaign engaging with the full spectrum of today's media. The Hub will also tap into existing outreach channels such as a Hub website, UK Museums, Academies and Professional Societies. The aim is for the Hub to become an authoritative global voice of PETRAS/IoT aspects, and to create brand value for its long-term, sustainable and impactful future</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-02-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>4559840</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The development of humanised IoT devices has created an emerging discussion around 'Smart Gnomes' aimed at deployment around QEOP.

Anonymous prayers submitted by members of the congregation are projected onto the floor of the church to promote empathy within the church community. Focus groups held with community groups within the parish demonstrated a very positive response to the installation and consequently we have recently partnered with a second church (The Church of St Michael and All Angels) in Cumbria to allow the trial of remote digital empathy between an urban and a rural parish. This second church was selected for this work as, aside from the significant distance between the two locations (approx. 370km), there is a significant contrast between the typically younger and relatively static community at St Peter's, and the typically older community of St Michael's which is extended in the summer months by many tourists to the Lake District who visit the church. Of particular interest will be the extent to which it is possible to develop a 'community spirit' between the two churches, the extent to which the two communities are able to feel empathetic towards the other, and the potential for the development of pro-social and pro-community behaviours between the two communities.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Defence Science &amp; Technology Laboratory (DSTL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>DSTL Letter of Support for PETRAS Internet of Things Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>6CCE5A48-87B2-46B7-8224-1DE5D334C1D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DSTL have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

Re: TRL Statement of support for the Centre for Internet of Things
TRL, the UK's Transport Research Laboratory, is an internationally recognised centre of excellence providing world-class research, consultancy and product testing, covering all aspects of transport. TRL was established in 1933 and since that time has continually made significant and lasting contributions to the development of safe, efficient and effective transport systems in the UK and beyond. We currently employ around 375 staff, most of whom are technical specialists in their field, with experts in engineering, statistics, software, psychology and human factors. TRL has access to a range of dedicated facilities including modelling &amp;amp; simulation software, advanced driving simulators, crash test rigs and test tracks. Our head office is in Crowthorne, Berkshire and the company has an annual turnover in excess of &amp;pound;30m. Satellite offices operate in Scotland, Wales, Dubai and Qatar. TRL operates the TRL Academy, an internal body with responsibility for maintaining the academic and research strengths upon which the organisation is founded. The Academy also manages our ongoing engagement with a range of universities and research organisations from the UK and beyond.
We are well aware of the strong capabilities of the core university partners and have a number of research connections. We are, for example, working with Warwick on a &amp;quot;Towards autonomy - Smart and connected control&amp;quot; EPSRC project so are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative.
TRL's business focuses on the generation and application of knowledge in the transport domain. We anticipate that IoT will be a major driver for innovation and development in transport over the next 10 years and will have a huge impact on the safety, efficiency and effectiveness of transport systems of all kinds. It is therefore vital that we understand these developments so that we remain relevant to our markets and customers and are better placed to generate and apply new knowledge in the area. We anticipate that IoT will impact particularly on connected and automated vehicles and on smart cities/smart infrastructure, all of which are important areas of work for us but also areas where the threat of cyber-crime is increasingly high-profile. We also need to understand how these aspects will be handled and will affect our clients and our work.

We intend to engage with and contribute to the Research Hub in a number of ways. Firstly, we would seek to participate as members of the External Advisory Group to help provide direction and governance to the programme. Secondly, we would help to develop the scope for projects undertaken within the Centre's programme based on our knowledge of the domain and future research requirements; this will include participation in workshops, &amp;quot;sandpits&amp;quot; and the like. Thirdly, depending on the scope of the research, we may be able to supply research data or access to specific facilities or equipment. Finally, we would hope to find suitable projects in which we can collaborate (e.g. by contribution of staff effort, secondment of staff to the centre, hosting of centre staff at TRL and co-supervising PhD students).
It is difficult to define the precise financial value of our proposed in-kind support. For budgetary estimation purposes, we suggest maximum values for the four items described over a three year period as follows:
1. Participation in External Advisory Group activities &amp;pound;10k
2. Project scoping and advice &amp;pound;10k
3. Access to data and facilities &amp;pound;30k
4. Project collaboration &amp;pound;60k

In conclusion, we are very pleased to be supporting this impressive initiative directed by Professor Jeremy Watson of UCL. The Centre for the Internet of Things can develop as a Research Hub of activity in this priority area for the UK and TRL can play an active role in supporting its development and operation. We highly commend this proposal and look forward to joining a first class team.
Yours sincerely

We have weekly meetings with the entire team (CEO and two senior engineers) and we have constant updates in cases of work that affects our experiments.
Grove IS helps develop the Powbal platform. This allows us to schedule the switch-off events for hundreds of plugs, collect the status of each plug and store the data. The platform also calculates the reward points based on the performance of each individual (if they abide by the smart grid choices or not and the power consumed). The company supports the platform, hosts the server on its cloud infrastructure, stores the data for our work and provides support related to the performance of the platform. We also have a two-year Premium support (worth 9,600 GBP) for a 24/7 phone and email support, In version maintenance, feature enhancement support and version upgrade protection (See contract).
Poplar Harca hosts the testbed for SeMIoT experiments, these are the residences that host the plugs we measure. Poplar provides us with access to their facilities, connection with impact champions (energy sensitive individuals to &amp;quot;spread the word&amp;quot; about our work), background information (addresses, names, etc) for the participants, management of the lists and the changes in their premises, etc. They also have organised bi weekly calls with us to provide updates about the progress of the experiments. 
An individual researcher (Alexandros Kosiaris) has helped us to produce the new version of the Powbal platform and contributed to the previous rounds of these experiments. Without his support on a weekly basis this platform would not have become a reality.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The research team creates the algorithms the randomly allocate switch off events to the plugs. The team analyzes the responses from the participants and informs them about their performance. The team distributes rewards and monitors the use of the plugs consequently. The research team manages the distribution of the plugs, the resolution of technical faults and the replacement of equipment. The team also reports the results on the dedicated website : www.powbal.net and the PETRAS hub.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Institute for Sustainability</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>Institute for Sustainability Letter of Support for PETRAS Internet of Things Hub</gtr:description><gtr:id>F71282E1-8F5F-45FA-B61A-0E01BBE8F225</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Institute for Sustainability have written a letter of support committing their resources to the furtherance of this project.

They will turbocharge some jobs and replace others. They will also create new industries that call for workers with skills that do not yet exist. Policymakers must start thinking now about how to realise the potential for AI and Machine Learning to increase economic productivity and to improve the lives of millions-especially people in the developing world.

As a consequence of putting IoT on the agenda, we were introduced to counterparts in China with whom we will continue to collaborate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture - Ethox Centre seminar series - 2016 - University of Oxford, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D05C0922-F1D0-44C3-93DC-9885661793A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk title: &amp;quot;From individual to group privacy in biomedical Big Data&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> PETRAS SGP: User Engagement Secure by Default (IoT) - Europe, Data, Digital and Security Directorate / Department of Culture, Media and Sport</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9F8488C8-66EA-46BA-B82A-B741515FC1D3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Meeting with Edward Venmore-Rowland, Secure by Default (IoT) Project Manager of the Europe, Data, Digital and Security Directorate within the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

The report explored how the UK can create a 'data-enabled' economy through the use of data analytics supported by advanced data connectivity. It examined the opportunities and barriers for organisations and sectors to improve products and services using data analytics, and identified where innovations are possible that can help address the UK's productivity deficit. The sectors explored were advanced manufacturing, built environment, energy, transport, health, aerospace and defence, and insurance.

A key theme emerging from discussions at these workshops was concerns around the integrity and assurance of data, devices and systems in applications such as critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things. In particular, the interconnection of different systems will create systems of systems, either designed or accidental, that are vulnerable to anticipated emergent behaviour, including cascades of failure. One possible source of weakness is the poor quality of software in embedded systems. 

This workshop responds to the first recommendation of Connecting data on 'Strengthening the foundations' (see page 4 of the report). It aims to explore what kind of enabling structure is needed that will ensure safety and resilience, without restricting innovation. Consideration of the need for best engineering practice and systems engineering approaches is a key part of this, as well as incentives to improve the quality of software, hardware and systems. It is also important to understand the cyber-challenge from a socio-technical point of view, with social science playing a key role alongside physical science and engineering in addressing knowledge and capability gaps.

The workshop will bring together representatives from industry, academia, government and infrastructure regulators, with an interest in the safety and resilience of the Internet of Things and critical infrastructure.

Objectives of the workshop:
? To explore the nature of the vulnerabilities created by the interconnection and interdependence of the systems associated with critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things, and identify examples.

? To explore the key objectives and characteristics of an enabling structure, that promotes innovation while ensuring safety and resilience. This would need to apply both to the implementation of new infrastructure and to the phased improvement of legacy systems. 

? To identify possible tools and methodologies for much higher quality in software development. This could include consideration of best engineering practices, and in particular, systems engineering approaches, as well as other rigorous methods built on mathematical foundations. 

To discuss additional mechanisms to incentivise the quality of software, hardware and systems, such as the introduction of enhanced liability in certain situations on producers and importers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>12th October 2016 - Presentation at Research Strategies: Europe 2030 and the next Framework Programme</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>02E548A7-8FCE-402F-BE32-A0E528F05293</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Carsten Maple participated in an event that was designed to shape the future of research in cyber security.

The aim of the conference was to bring together leading academics, law enforcement professionals and representatives from industry and the voluntary sector, on the theme of modern crime prevention. In particular, the focus was on updating prevention in the context of two significant and urgent challenges: firstly, minimising the opportunities that the internet and new technology offer criminals, including organised criminals; and secondly, the need to do more to tackle the victimisation of vulnerable people through crimes that have often been under-reported in the past, such as domestic abuse, child exploitation and slavery. It was intended that the conference, which will be hosted by the Home Secretary, provide a platform to highlight new research, showcase frontline innovation and generate new ideas from a wide range of partners with a stake in protecting the public.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at International Conference on Cyber Crimes in Abu Dhabi</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>583DB4D7-06A2-4555-8C0D-EBF8C5CFDDC2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Carsten Maple gave a presentation at the International Conference on Cyber Crime in Abu Dhabi

The Design Informatics exhibition, Living with Data, is displayed in a Pavilion produced by Biomorphis architects. It features a range of products and experiences which look to the future: 
In this demo we introduce Bitbarista, a coffee machine that exemplifies a new approach to data access and usage for the design of IoT devices. Bitbarista is connected to the Internet and attempts to communicate complex data processes, gathering consistent information on the state of coffee producing countries. It reveals the social, environmental, qualitative and economic aspects of coffee supply chains affecting end-prices, of which consumers are often unaware. Bitbarista allows people to choose a source of future coffee beans for the machine, and situates their choices within the pool of decisions previously made. In doing so, it places customers within the complexity of factors involved in coffee production, distribution and purchase. The aim is to expose this complexity in order to re-engage users in the market forces that influence and are driven by their choices, providing a positive experience of data display, usage and sharing.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/news-events/recentnews/design-informatics-at-the-festival</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>PETRAS SGP: User Engagement UK-Japan Exchange on the &quot;InterNational Cyber Security Center of Excellence (INCS-CoE)&quot;</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E19FCBFC-203F-4212-BA9A-95FD1B8E89A0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a meeting between PETRAS and in particular its Standards, Governance and Policy Stream to discuss the establishment of the world's first &amp;quot;InterNational Cyber Security Center of Excellence&amp;quot; (INCS-CoE) in Japan and the potential involvement of PETRAS researchers in this project.

Within STiPS the aim is to explore the particular challenges of developing systems for secure, low-friction, transactions in public spaces. In this workshop we are interested in exploring not only in the exchange of monetary currency, but also in the concept of trading data and personal information, where the line between data and currency blurs, and data becomes currency. As well as the explicit exchanges taking place between people, we are also interested in the trading and transfer of data taking place between devices and systems, of which people are generally unaware, but which forms part of this complex web of data transactions.
 
In the STiPS project so far we have begun to map out the practices and transactions currently taking place in a series of ethnographic studies, and have explored reactions to the BitBarista a hacked coffee machine that sells coffee for Bitcoin. We are looking to move into adopting technology developed at the RBS that may support new data transaction systems.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Technology Road Mapping Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>83F05396-098C-466B-BE0C-C2581FCD4B40</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prof Jeremy Watson presented a Keynote Speech at this workshop, which was arranged by UCL Enterprise, and was held with construction companies on the area of technology road mapping for IoT in the built environment</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>13th September 2016 - Meeting with Pinsent Masons</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9A815DF-AE3E-4360-955A-0219C539F61C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussions on Pinsent Masons collaboration with PETRAS around the core themes of transport and mobility and privacy and trust</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at Workshop on Theory and Practice of Secure Multi-Party Computation</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EBF14BF8-3D4F-4571-A6B2-5A9EC42D4FB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Patrick Ah-Fat attended the above workshop to learn more about this research topic and its practical relevance.

We are investigating a technology which involved secure identifier management systems to describe the deployment, the data produce and protocols for access. The resultant database that be utilize in the IoT implementation and subsequent operation.

It is realize that one of the key barriers to the acceptability of IoT applications is the need to ensure security and privacy. Similar concerns will apply as to whether different IoT applications will be permitted to use the same deployment of assets.

We are investigating a generic approach to resolving this problem by the use of a secure identifier management system, We will use an existing open source system called Handle. This is nearly to allow rapid progress in tackling the problem. Handle seems to provide the sort of security, distribution and large scale capability to meet most of our requirements.At in an early stage we will explore to what extend the facilities such as security, maintenance and extension in the IoT domain.

While both of problem and the approach are generic, it is important to applied them in an specific application domain which is both important and tractable. One such domain is that of the building information model (BIM) which has been mandated by the UK government for our future procurement from central fundings. 

A current level 2 of that standard foul of the needs of IoT and security. We are making contributions to the migration of that technology towards BIM Level 3, which is targeted to solved this problems completely.

One of the main technologies to represent building models is IFC (Industry Foundation Classes). The present state,named IFC4 can help automate building design and construction, but it not rich enough to include IoT and security. 

To achieve our goal, our work is based in two different contributions:IFC+ and the use of Handle System as support for digital objects.

The extension of IFC4 have to had detail descriptions of the attributes required for networks, security and data description. Handle System is a Secure Identifier Management System open available resolve, store and manage system which is globally accessible and widely used in other domain areas. It already contains hundreds of millions of entities in large number of servers. It provides a complete infrastructure for the prevision of types of encryption techniques to ensure the authentication and protection of the digital objects.

In addition, the use of Handle permits access control of what entities can perform operations on the deployment database we show in some sample instances how to transform the file based IFC into the sort of database suitable for secure operations with Handle. It is this form of database which is then used for secure IoT applications.

Because data and procedures can be incorporated into the Handle system database and in its integrated fashion, this technology can be used also to describe how the data is transmitted and can be accessed. This goes considerably beyond the current achievements of BIM Level 2.

The use of both technologies, IFC+ and Handle System, allow to deploy IoT scenarios (Smart buildings) ready to be used by multi stakeholder IoT applications, assuring the privacy and security aspects.

This specific Handle implementation includes a number of facilities to improve performances and resilience, we will investigate to what extend this relevant in this application domain.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A645A3A7-C0EE-4BA4-A9DE-D3585DA0D518</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We dont yet have any notable impact result.

Note: the IoT Egg forms part of the IoT-smart display campus testbeds in Surrey and Lancaster, part of the DiSSC project within PETRAS.</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD5C96EC-3324-4216-BD65-6825B3013D31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>to this date the app is only used in experiments and exhibitions.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Magic Lense for the IoT Egg</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>An open IoT data management platform based on CKAN to support the storage and distribution of highways maintenance datasets</gtr:description><gtr:id>2C96F496-E93D-4123-BDBE-37ED56233440</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This platform is enabling highways maintainer organisations to open and share typically silo'd datasets to facilitate new applications that will shape future highways management working practices.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Highways Maintenance IoT Data Hub</gtr:title><gtr:type>Webtool/Application</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/30073571-3AD5-437E-BC36-1472BD1D668F"><gtr:id>30073571-3AD5-437E-BC36-1472BD1D668F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Digital Built Britain</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8348ebf63cd6f0c035c747a49a73625b"><gtr:id>8348ebf63cd6f0c035c747a49a73625b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Bew M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3B3E1DAE-0510-4958-989D-6E153BE69EA2"><gtr:id>3B3E1DAE-0510-4958-989D-6E153BE69EA2</gtr:id><gtr:title>PETRAS - Cyber Security of the Internet of Things</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>AG Adjacent Government</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/e3c09e1691d079f2c1777648003336f0"><gtr:id>e3c09e1691d079f2c1777648003336f0</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Watson, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6C52E3F5-4F9A-4F0C-A3A0-CD7B52CD04C0"><gtr:id>6C52E3F5-4F9A-4F0C-A3A0-CD7B52CD04C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Faultless responsibility: on the nature and allocation of moral responsibility for distributed moral actions.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical transactions.
