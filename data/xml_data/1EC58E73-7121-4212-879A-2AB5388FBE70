&lt;p>This network will explore China's role as the new 'shaper' of global development under the ESRC's Rising Powers' Programme. The aim of the network is to bridge the gap between the currently prevailing understanding of China's policy interests and processes and its development impacts in low income countries. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Network members are leading academics, policy analysts and policy-makers from China, Europe and low income countries who will be led by Dr Frauke Urban of the Climate Change and Development Centre, Institute of Development Studies (IDS) in cooperation with Open University and Tsinghua University. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three workshops will be organised in Beijing, London and Brighton. The first workshop willl discuss the implications of a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of the domestic processes behind China's development activities for its external engagements.The second workshop will analyse the actors, institutions and modes of interaction through which China and low income countries engage. The third workshop will apply the analytical framework developed throughout the network activities to particular areas of on-going research on energy and climate change, focusing on the Mekong Region and Africa. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>66222</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Open University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rising Powers dams project - OU, Nottingham Ningbo, SOAS</gtr:description><gtr:id>9564470E-D8A2-418A-BFA3-31EF24294ED7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Project:

networking grant under the ESRC 'Rising Powers' scheme. The project contributed to a wide range of workshops and networking activities with non-academic audiences, most importantly non-governmental organisations and government agencies such as the UK Department for International Development DfID. As a result of the project, long-term collaborations with these organisations (most importantly the NGO International Rivers) continued and led to further funding and research activities under the ESRC-funded 'China goes global' project, which deals with large Chinese hydropower dams in Asia and Africa. The project had a direct influence on the sustainability practices of large dam-builders.

Project summary
The emergence of China as a global player challenges the pre-existing dominance of the OECD
countries and will continue to be a crucial force for global change in coming decades. The implications
of China's rise will be most significant for Low Income Countries (LICs), but the outcomes will also affect
China's relations with traditional donors like DfID, and the understanding of the process of development.
The aim of the network was to improve the understanding of China's rise as a global development actor,
the implications for LICs and the international development community. From this enhanced
understanding and the strengthening of international networks the longer term aim is to pursue further
research projects. The network was lead by the Institute of Development Studies, the Open University
and Tsinghua University. The network was composed of leading academics and policy-makers from
China, Europe and LICs. Three workshops were organised in Beijing, London and Brighton. The first
workshop discussed the implications of a more nuanced understanding of the processes behind China's
development activities for its external engagements. The second workshop analysed the actors,
institutions and modes of interaction through which China and LICs engage. The third workshop applied
the analytical framework developed throughout the network activities to particular areas of research on
energy and the environment. This served the goals of testing the analytical framework. This project
confirmed that while traditional powers often consider China's rise as a competitive threat, China can
offer an alternative model of development for LICs.

Project implementation
The network was composed of leading academics, policy analysts and policy-makers from China,
Europe and low income countries (LICs). In addition we invited key actors from donors such as DFID
and the EU, research institutions, think tanks and NGOs to the workshops. Three two-day workshops
were organised in Beijing, London and Brighton. The first workshop in Beijing in July 2010 discussed the
implications of a more nuanced and in-depth understanding of the domestic processes behind China's
development activities for its external engagements and how this compared to the OECD's development
activities. Desk research was undertaken to analyse the debates that inform China's development policy
thinking and the OECD's policy thinking as a contrast. This formed the first position paper (See Urban,
Mohan and Zhang, 2010) which was distributed to the network members before the first workshop. It
examined the place of foreign aid and overseas development in the Chinese political discourse. It
identified the range and nature of actors and their incentives, and current forms of regulation and
institutions of development management, all of which shape China's development engagements and
impacts. The second workshop in London in September 2011 analysed the actors, institutions and
modes of interaction through which China and LICs engage. Desk research was carried out to review
existing literature from different countries and regions, and identify knowledge gaps particularly around the non-economic modes of interaction between China and LICs. The third workshop in Brighton in
November 2011 applied the analytical framework developed throughout the network activities to
particular areas of on-going research on energy and the environment. This served the goals of testing
the analytical framework, refining the framework and methodology and synthesizing the lessons from
the three workshops. Desk research was on China's rise as a development actor in the Mekong Region
and Africa in relation to energy developments, where energy is a cross-cutting theme involving
environmental, economic, social and political issues. A second position paper was developed around
China's engagement in the oil sector in Africa (see Urban et al 2011), which tested the analytical
framework developed throughout the network activities. The Visiting Fellows played a critical role in
supporting the desk research and in the development of the position papers.

The international research community still has a limited and Eurocentric understanding of the
complexities of China's internal processes and thinking on international development. Debates from
Western 'development studies' are virtually non-existent in China. The workshops enabled fruitful
exchanges with Chinese colleagues about the nature of development. That said, Western theory and
practice has tended to focus on criticising modernity and searching for more effective solutions to
development problems while the Chinese debates inject a useful dose of Realpolitik around the need for
technology, infrastructure and growth. Representatives of various agencies discussed their stance on
these issues in the workshops. In workshop 1 we discussed the areas where Chinese and European
policy is actually in agreement, which is far more commonplace than the more antagonistic analyses of
China as a 'rogue donor' would have us believe. This provides opportunities for trilateral cooperation
between Europe, China and LICs. Other key debates of workshop 1 were around the diverse and
fragmented actors and motives of China's international development, which goes far beyond the idea of
a 'Beijing Consensus'. That said, we need to avoid treating China as endlessly unique since with
globalisation its development is inextricably linked to the dynamics of other states and markets so that
its trajectory can never be endogenous despite the strong state. Our current frameworks for
understanding the multiple actors and channels of interaction are inadequate and too focused on the
economic drivers. Crucially, by disaggregating channels we miss the many ways in which different
channels interact, reinforce or undermine one another. Important non-economic drivers, such as
environmental and social drivers, are often neglected. This was discussed in detail in workshop 2.
Furthermore the heavy reliance on economic drivers of much existing analysis significantly underplays
the environmental aspects of China's global role. China currently has the world's highest greenhouse
gas emissions, however at the same time it also plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. China also plays a crucial role for transboundary water management, such as in Southeast Asia along the Lancang / Mekong river, and plays a role in overseas environmental degradation (e.g. soil, air, water) and resource depletion (e.g. energy, minerals).
Nevertheless we still know very little of how China 'exports' its environmental footprint, both positively
and negatively, for example through hydropower projects and low cost, low carbon technologies for
LICs. These issues were discussed in detail in Workshop 3 and link into research plans for the second
phase of the ESRC Rising Powers call.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Summary of impacts to date:
The network was a very policy-oriented network; hence separating the 'scientific' from the 'economic
and societal' seems artificial as we attempted to do both at the same time. The project had direct policy
implications by sharing information and engaging through the workshops and outputs with donors and
policy-makers from DfID, the European Union and Chinese authorities. One of the outputs of the project
was a policy brief which gave policy recommendations for policy-makers from China, traditional donor
countries and low income countries. The network has lead to the publishing of a Policy Brief which
made an impact in the policy arena by making recommendations for policy-makers and policy analysts
in China, the traditional donor countries and LICs. The target audience are donors from DfID, the
European Union and other traditional donors, along with government representatives from China and
LICs, particularly in Africa. The workshops influenced the academic and policy debate around China's
development activities in LICs and the actors, institutions and modes of interaction through which China
and LICs engage. The workshop made an impact by developing a new analytical framework for
assessing China's rise. The workshops, discussions and newly-formed relationships generated a
number of new bids and proposals for further research. To date, 14 funding proposals have been
submitted and at least 11 funding proposals will be submitted as a consequence of the network. In
addition the network has generated about 30 publications, including peer-reviewed journal articles, book
chapters and books. There has been a range of media outputs, web stories and policy briefs which were
generated by the network members and workshop participants. The network has further lead to more
than 30 presentations at scientific conferences and policy-relevant events at the national and
international level. More than 15 new partnerships were formed according to the information from the
network members and workshop participants. We also have a project website which holds all PPTs and
summaries from the workshops, working papers and other material. The website has been very well
frequented by users (http://risingpowers.open.ac.uk/). This is in addition to the uploaded outputs on the
ESRC Rising Powers website. In addition there is an IDS project website
(http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/idsproject/china-as-the-new-shaper-of-global-development).

A follow up project of the network project was the ESRC 'China goes global' project, for which a wide range of findings and outputs is available.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>EFCAFA0C-D34E-46FA-9F3E-F1333956B7BD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://risingpowers.open.ac.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE4F068D-8F49-495F-8C25-A604F540AB83"><gtr:id>BE4F068D-8F49-495F-8C25-A604F540AB83</gtr:id><gtr:title>The Ambiguous Role of Corporations in Climate Change Mitigation: An Explorative Appraisal of Corporations in China, Malaysia and the US</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65"><gtr:id>b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban, F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4D6931D1-4971-4F01-9853-D2FAED242BA1"><gtr:id>4D6931D1-4971-4F01-9853-D2FAED242BA1</gtr:id><gtr:title>The understanding and practice of development in China and the European Union.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65"><gtr:id>b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban, F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FB66CB95-8332-4F0C-A7B4-0BAA47F54A90"><gtr:id>FB66CB95-8332-4F0C-A7B4-0BAA47F54A90</gtr:id><gtr:title>Special Issue - China as a new shaper of international development: the environmental implications.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment, Development and Sustainability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2be8eacd0372b1fb01b0eb157f2b4ca9"><gtr:id>2be8eacd0372b1fb01b0eb157f2b4ca9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban, F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/B77977C4-340E-4EB7-AC02-F1CF05140F2D"><gtr:id>B77977C4-340E-4EB7-AC02-F1CF05140F2D</gtr:id><gtr:title>China and the African oil sector: channels of engagement, motives, actors and impacts.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65"><gtr:id>b9612c49e0628ffb96d120cbb3f53f65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban, F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A363AE4F-D17D-4E6B-8276-0E5FD42A0CB9"><gtr:id>A363AE4F-D17D-4E6B-8276-0E5FD42A0CB9</gtr:id><gtr:title>China's Rise - Implications for Low Income Countries.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2be8eacd0372b1fb01b0eb157f2b4ca9"><gtr:id>2be8eacd0372b1fb01b0eb157f2b4ca9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban, F.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2010-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/5F5056F5-2F8C-4510-9EC9-0695FEAB9EF7"><gtr:id>5F5056F5-2F8C-4510-9EC9-0695FEAB9EF7</gtr:id><gtr:title>China as a new shaper of international development: the environmental implications</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Environment, Development and Sustainability</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1280c3e3c0b2d168c3855c5e980a8dd1"><gtr:id>1280c3e3c0b2d168c3855c5e980a8dd1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Urban F</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2012-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RES">RES-075-25-0019</gtr:identifier><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/H03272X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EBACD6D4-D1E5-4970-8BEC-7F4568EB26BA</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp;
