Engagement (Social Media Enhancement)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/M001628/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>There is now a broad consensus that new forms of social data emerging from people?s day-to-day activities on the web have the potential to transform the social sciences. However, there is also agreement that current analytical techniques fall short of the methodological standards required for academic research and policymaking and that conclusions drawn from social media data have much greater utility when combined with results drawn from other datasets (including various public sector resources made available through open data initiatives).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this proposal we outline the case for further investigations into the challenges surrounding social media data and the social sciences. Aspects of the work will involve analysis of social media data in a number of contexts, including:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>transport disruption around the 2014 Commonwealth Games (Glasgow)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>news stories about Scottish independence and UK-EU relations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>island communities in the Western Isles.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Guided by insights from these case studies we will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>develop a suite of software tools to support various aspects of data analysis and curation&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>provide guidance on ethical considerations surrounding analysis of social media data&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>deliver training workshops for social science researchers&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>engage with the public on this important topic through a series of festivals (food, music, science).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Key beneficiaries include:

1. Academic researchers who are considering use of social media data in their research plans.

2. Policy makers who have difficulty understanding the validity of findings from social media analytics;

3. Public transport operators and agencies who currently struggle to develop coherent social media strategies; 

4. Market research organisations who would benefit from more sophisticated analysis, including perceived pros and cons, identification of claims that hold widespread support, and arguments that are found to be convincing;

5. Developers of tools for social media analytics;

6. Members of the public who may be frustrated by the ways in which social media are used by commercial organisations and agencies.

How will they benefit?
1. Through the availability of training events, ethical guidelines, case studies and data (where possible).

2. Via a series of case studies we will highlight the potential and pitfalls of social media analysis, and will share these experiences with a range of academic and non-academic audiences.

3. By harnessing the potential for social media to be used constructively both as a means to develop more effective intervention strategies and as a platform for public communication, transport operators and agencies will enhance the effectiveness of their operations as well as influencing public perception of their sector. 

4. Argumentation mining software offers clear benefits to policy makers and industry sectors such as market research. At present, sentiment (or opinion) mining tools, which identify positive and negative opinions on topics of interest, enjoy widespread success. Companies use sentiment analysis over social media routinely to understand public opinion about their products. Argumentation mining would allow more sophisticated forms of analysis.

5. Through the development of new prototype tools (for argument mining, qualitative modelling, dataset annotation) we will advance the state of the art in aspects of social media analytics, and data management.

6. The public will have the opportunity to engage directly with the social media data agenda and to influence both the direction of the research and its outcomes; in particular, ethical guidelines will emerge that reflect public concerns.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-02-14</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>541922</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Collection of photographs from Commonwealth Games 2014 as part of fieldwork activities associated with work on social media and transport disruption.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B6F44822-D428-4E50-A6E7-0510830BC3B4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Visual documentation of transport disruption during the Games</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Fieldwork Visual Documentation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Image</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Twitter and Transport - Commonwealth Games 2014</gtr:description><gtr:id>46E582F3-D8CA-40EA-A428-0C792E5A3018</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Interview data.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Engagement via interviews.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Engagement with marketing/social media representatives of Commonwealth Games 2014.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Robert Gordon University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Management</gtr:department><gtr:description>User requirements for social scientists collecting and linking social media (user requirements interview study)</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB93D8F9-BCCC-4CC1-94DF-3D68A7393B95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have developed an open source extensible software architecture to support social scientists working with social media data.

The three activities allowed participants to fish for twitter data to see how academic researchers investigate diverse topics such as travel disruption at major sporting events, UK-EU relations and the Scottish Independence Referendum. At the Social Media Spying Pool people discovered how national security agencies used fake social media accounts to investigate people.

- Results from the work analysing the Scottish independence referendum (2014) and UK General Election (2015) Twitter data have been communicated to various groups within the Scottish National Party. A paper was circulated around regional constituencies where there was significant interest in the electoral and policy implications of the findings. This was accompanied by three, very well received, invited presentations attended by party activists as well as local and national politicians. 

- Work undertaken with respect to the use of social media platforms (in particular, Twitter) for purposes of communication between public transport operators and passengers has been presented to employees of FirstGroup, a major public transport company, who have indicated interest in adopting 'lessons learned' into their social media practices. First in Aberdeen subsequently modified their social media practice as a result of this interaction.

- Work on opinion mining and methodological provenance is being used in collaboration with Foods Standards Scotland to build a Food Sentiment Observatory - a software platform designed to investigate policy issues associated with food safety and food crime.

- The social media ethics framework is already gaining traction, and has been adopted by a number of academic and professional groups.

- Researchers who participated in the two social media training workshops will have benefitted through their exposure to analytical tools and methods.

- A significant project activity involved engaging nearly 3000 members of the public with agendas related to social media and its use in society. While it is difficult to directly assess our impact on individuals, feedback from post-event surveys indicated that our engagements were often the first time when people began to consider issues such as personal privacy and social media.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>D9C86E50-F70A-40ED-92DE-C1C229F7DEEB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Government, Democracy and Justice,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project achieved the following:

Production of a number of novel open-source software tools to aid researchers (and others) with collection and analysis of social media data. These include: an interactive tool designed to guide social scientists in collecting, linking, coding and annotating social media data; software to identify and cluster points made in online political debates; code to analyse online texts to determine likely purchase intentions; a Web-based tool able to assess research methodology descriptions in papers/reports and then guide authors to ensure that their research using social media data has been sufficiently well-documented for it to be reproducible by others.

Investigated the use of social media data as a means to study society - via a number of datasets/scenarios: Twitter data relating to transport disruption during the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games; Twitter data gathered during the run-up to the Scottish Independence Referendum 2014; Twitter discussions during the UK General Election campaign of 2015; Goodreads online book reviews, recommendations and purchase intentions. Findings from these studies included: 

- The coordinated approach to Twitter used by a consortium of transport providers during the Commonwealth Games revealed both the extent to which social media may be used to communicate cohesive, reliable information to travellers, and the trust in that information revealed by public interaction. 

- While economic factors appeared to play an underlying role in mobilising public opinion during the Independence Referendum and General Election, contrary to many assumptions, identity and nationalist sentiments were much more central. There also appeared to be a significant focus on discontent over rising economic inequality, a factor potentially reflected in both support for the SNP's social democratic agenda in Scotland and support for Corbyn amongst younger left leaning voters in England.

Developed a set of ethical guidelines for research using social media data, for use by students, researchers, and institutional ethics committees. Issues considered within the framework include: platform-specific legal obligations, user privacy, risk, data sharing and re-use. The guidelines have already been communicated widely to audiences including the International Sociological Association, Social Research Association, and Academy of Social Sciences.

Supported the development of analytical capabilities within two cohorts of social science researchers through the delivery of social media data training workshops for early career researchers (April 2016) and doctoral students (June 2016). These events mixed presentations from researchers working on the grant, with discussions (on data ethics, data provenance, and curation); participants also gained hands-on experience using a range of analytical tools.

Delivered an extensive programme of public engagement events and activities that between them reached nearly 3000 members of the public across the UK. These explored a range of themes including the role of social media in political discourse, issues of trust and privacy surrounding social media data, and the role of such data in understanding and communicating transport disruption. Our experience in planning and delivering the programme of events featured in an invited ESRC blog post entitled &amp;quot;Public Engagement and Social Media&amp;quot;.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Several outcomes have the potential to be taken forward or used by others:

Open source software tools to support various aspects of social media data analytics have been made available for download - either for use or further development. For example, the summarisation and point extraction tools could be applied to responses collected from online policy consultations by government agencies.&amp;nbsp;

A number of social media datasets (and associated collections reflecting attitudes to social media data) have been made available; these could be used for further research or to support teaching activities. The web site http://indyref.abdn.ac.uk/ was established to visualise the topics extracted from the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum and 2015 UK General Election datasets, and to make these results more accessible to the public.

Findings from the analysis of social media data in areas such as transport disruption, online political discourse, and consumer reviews can be utilised by researchers, politicians, policy makers, and business. 

The framework for social research ethics has already been shared with a sizeable audience, and has the potential to be adopted by a wide community - both within the social sciences and beyond.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0A6B3DF9-417B-4483-892E-79E2DD07BCFD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in Defra Vision25 Environment launch event #openenvironment</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8CFC241A-A807-49AD-A0D9-42B4B980F8ED</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in Singapore Government Foresight study on Future Urban Transportation and Mobility</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DD1C9EFC-0C87-4A50-B332-AA604A2CEC4A</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Collection of Tweets associated with Commonwealth Games transport collected via the TMI interface developed at the University of Aberdeen.</gtr:description><gtr:id>7AD111B4-CDEC-4021-9DEB-6B00B8A3388B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>All impacts associated with the twitter and transport project have relied in part upon the underlying data</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>TMI - Commonwealth Games Transport</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Survey instrument and responses collected as part of a study into the level of documentation (provenance) associated with projects using (analysing) social media data.

A user would be able to create a topic based on a search term with multiple publishers and subscribers. Publishers in this case represent sources of social networking data. The subscribers perform actions on that data be it displaying the data in the GUI or performing analysis on that data. The system provides a default subscriber that stores and maintains the data whilst providing annotation features in the applications GUI. The GUI is a tabbed layout where each tab represents a topic (search term).

This tool satisfies the primary requirement of social scientists working with social media who we interviewed as part of our ongoing research activities for this project. Existing means of capturing social media data are typically licensed and acquiring data through api access is not suitable for social scientists lacking the technical knowledge required to capture social media data. We anticipate that this tool we improve the means by which social scientists (specifically participants we interviewed for this project) are able to collect, link / code/ annotate social media data as part of their research. In addition, due to the extensible nature of the software we have developed, we anticipate that this tool will have further impact by making available more sophisticated and advanced forms of analysis, utilising machine learning techniques such as text classification for sentiment analysis.</gtr:description><gtr:id>6A1A770B-FC63-4A71-84D0-1F9B879E0E7A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>None yet known</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>Social media data capture tool and annotation tool</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://github.com/ptravers/fsc</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>An online tool to assist social scientists with creation of textual descriptions of the use of social media data in their research.
