Similarly in diseases that are spread by contact, infected individuals are more likely to contact other individuals that are close by or in their social group. The disease therefore spreads spatially through the population. There has been a number of computer models that show that this spatial spread can have a major effect on the disease dynamics. Recent work has shown that this spatial structure can also have important implications to the evolution of parasites. If they spread locally, they are selected for lower transmission and virulence. It is very difficult to test this sort of theory, but we have developed an insect virus system in which we can manipulate how locally the hosts move. Our recent work using this system has confirmed the predictions of the model of the effect of space on transmission; it was lower in a more viscose population. We now want to examine the role of spatial structure on the coevolution of the host in addition to the parasite. As such we propose to build computer models and use some mathematical approximation techniques to predict the effect of local infection on host resistance. We will then test this using our insect virus system. This mixture of theory and ecological experimentation will give us a much clearer idea of the implications of different degrees of local interactions on the evolution of disease causing organisms. Given that anthropological changes are altering the mixing patterns within many populations, it is important that we understand what the implications are to wildlife and human disease.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>27760</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited academic seminar</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3D375B6A-8696-4072-9171-23CA53110664</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Departmental seminar in which around 70 people attended from undergraduates to full academic staff with a range of disciplinary backgrounds.

As such it made an important contribution to our ability to manage disease in a variety of important situations. It also developed spatial theory in general and so the contributions there are specific to disease risk management as well as to the development of the tools for studying evolutionary theory and spatial modelling.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>61236A94-17BD-4A19-876B-6DBB59BD096A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes/><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Our work emphasizes the importance of spatial structure to parasite evolution. This spatial evolutionary theory is important because it predicts how different pathogens may respond to changes in patterns of mixing.

We highlight the importance of landscape heterogeneity and the proximity and size of adjacent habitats when predicting disease risk in a particular location. In addition, our analysis could be useful for other pathogen systems with generalist vectors and may inform policy on possible disease management strategies that incorporate host movements.

Our work also emphasises that local processes are essential in determining parasite-driven extinctions, and the role of parasites in the extinction of rare species may have been underplayed due to the classic assumption of global density-dependent transmission.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Some mathematical models are currently used to describe macroparasitic infections, but they are designed to describe helminth infections in terrestrial systems and are not adapted for aquatic systems. Ectoparasites, although common in aquatic systems do not occur in terrestrial systems (the closest analogy are ticks). Models have recently been developed to describe G.salaris on salmon. In particular an individual based model of the dynamics of parasites on a single host has been developed. However there are limitations with these models, particularly with respect to the distribution of parasites on hosts. Most models assume a negative binomial distribution, this is often confirmed with data when an infection is well established. However, the mechanism for the formation of these distribution is not well understood and it is not clear what the pattern of infection loads would be either at the beginning of an outbreak (if GS were to arrive in the UK) or following treatment. This lack of understanding makes it difficult to identify the best way to target treatment or what to expect immediately following treatment. Future work should focus on developing a new modelling approach which allows us to understand the dynamics and distribution of parasite loads per host under a range of different life history strategies and environmental conditions.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>40DCF866-7D88-4F8F-B62A-9F3D4FDAE2E2</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/E14E80A9-9986-4FD5-A639-CB4F4487B069"><gtr:id>E14E80A9-9986-4FD5-A639-CB4F4487B069</gtr:id><gtr:title>A theoretical study of the role of spatial population structure in the evolution of parasite virulence.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical population biology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/907923dcf60849551e0b5c3c8c5c7dcb"><gtr:id>907923dcf60849551e0b5c3c8c5c7dcb</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Webb SD</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2013-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0040-5809</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/34FCA5BD-D3F0-4C52-9F93-0E1CF45F149F"><gtr:id>34FCA5BD-D3F0-4C52-9F93-0E1CF45F149F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Local transmission processes and disease-driven host extinctions</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Theoretical Ecology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/f4c716a9b1ee2eb6076a8df269199978"><gtr:id>f4c716a9b1ee2eb6076a8df269199978</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Best A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2011-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A1DC17E6-2C58-4275-8C06-9E2FA2142549"><gtr:id>A1DC17E6-2C58-4275-8C06-9E2FA2142549</gtr:id><gtr:title>Host resistance and coevolution in spatially structured populations.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Proceedings.
