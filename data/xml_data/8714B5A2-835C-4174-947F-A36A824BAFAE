Fundamental Science master classes for school teachers at KS2 and KS3</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ST/N002083/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Think Universe masterclasses aim at training KS2 and KS3 teachers in a novel and simplified approach to fundamental views about the Universe (described in the case for support attached).

The Think Universe educational project has proven its value in a couple of pilot schemes at primary schools in North London, under Royal Society Partnership awards.

Now it is time to escalate the project to a higher and wider level, where its impact will start to be significant. Is it time to train the teachers who will deliver it in the classrooms of partner schools and this is the main aim of this application.

Along the 15 months requested, there would be around 20 masterclass series to a total audience of around 300 teachers, and around 400 pupils will benefit in some way from part of this training as the masterclasses come to their classrooms.

The training includes the proper operation of delicate scientific equipment like microscopes, telescopes and hand-held spectroscopes, that are used in the classroom by the pupils (see case for support).

The equipment required for these demonstrations will be supplied by the applicant.

In the same way, the applicant will supply camera for stills and video recording of the events and interviews for evaluation. There is only a request for a few hundred pounds for digital storage and other minor components.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>- By publications on the Think Universe website and on specialised journals at the UCL Institute of Education, Institute of Physics and the ASE. all of which have wide coverage nationwide.

- At the end of this grant, the updated Think Universe website would have detailed lesson plans, list of resources and downloadable presentations and video materials for teachers.

- By email to partner schools and educational federations, consortia, trusts, etc some of which are already mentioned in this application.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-01</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-11-02</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9481</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UCL interdisciplinary studies of evidence, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C207AD22-9B93-4395-BA2C-8ABD0628E374</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is an annual event with a very interactive audience coming from many UCL departments.

Five session of 3 hours each. It proved to be insufficient. Teachers were engaged, but we were restricted by their time availabilities. Implementation in the classroom became an issue as our project prefers 2 hour sessions with the pupils, but schools are already in 1 hour slots. Primary schools would be more flexible on this, as proven in our pilot sessions that preceded this grant. For secondary schools, we are re-structuring the lesson plans. These workshops were very useful for this.

We are confident that this group of 6 schools will become a partner of the project in due course.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/think-universe</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Flamsteed Astronomy Society, Greenwich, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0F0DABF-80CA-48CD-8AC8-5558A3B94604</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a promotional presentation to amateur astronomers and educators.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://flamsteed.info/2016/02/origins-think-universe-the-importance-of-science-in-modern-culture/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>visit to Oakham School, Rutland</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3C75C83-26DD-49FB-AFFE-8A82CF3E1E39</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This was a major lecture/debate with secondary school pupils and their families.
