&lt;p>It evaluates how the US and the EU seek to navigate the conflict of interests between supporting democracy on the one hand and securing other complex security goals in the region; such as secure oil and gas supplies, the movement of military and commercial traffic through the region, counter-terrorism and intelligence cooperation, counter-proliferation, and the security of regional allies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Using a constructivist Institutionalist methodology ,and advances in computer assisted qualitative data analysis research methods, the research explores changes in US and EU policy and the challenges western policy-makers face in a shifting geopolitical landscape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research also seeks to cast light on the nature of political change in the region evaluating whether the end result of the uprisings will be more peaceful and stable democracies, a reversion back to autocratic rule after a temporary pro-democracy hiatus, the seizure of power by Islamist-dominated governments, or a complex combination of all three.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Impact is very much part of the overall &amp;quot;DNA&amp;quot; of this research, which will benefit multiple stakeholders directly and indirectly, having been designed to create both medium-term benefits and a legacy beyond the life of the project.

For Academic Stakeholders the project will:
- Address important security issues in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) following the developments of the Arab Spring.
- Generate new knowledge to contribute to the ongoing debate of the West's relationship with the MENA.
- Enhance detailed knowledge of the Arab Spring's effect on US and EU relation's with Egypt, Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
- Establish new networks of UK and international scholars through constructing an International Politics of the Middle East Working Group, and a project Advisory Network, which will cross-fertilise multiple networks inside and outside of academia and support this research project.
- Innovate methodologically by building on an interdisciplinary Constructivist institutionalist framework and advancing the state of the art in computer assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) techniques.
- Produce a qualitative database exploitable for future researchers by myself and other analysts.

To advance the state of the specialist literature I will use the project to produce my second single-authored monograph, produce three academic journal articles targeted at high impact publications, present my ongoing results at international conferences and to validate/challenge my previous research findings by testing my former results with the latest CAQDAS techniques only made possible by recent technological advances. This latter will be part of an emphasis on creating a lasting legacy by building advanced CAQDAS skills capacity through delivering skills training to academic staff and students at Warwick and updating my &amp;quot;how to use CAQDAS&amp;quot; CD Rom and workbook for wider distribution.

For Policy-makers and practitioners this project will:
- Provide an evidence base from which policy decisions can be informed at the international level.
- Provide a comparative basis from which to access policy within the US and the EU. 
- Inform policy practitioners of the wider concerns about democracy promotion strategies and inform discussions of how to balance this with wider national security concerns.
- Challenge the assumptions upon which &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot; policy is constructed in order to contribute to the ongoing policy debate of how to engage with the MENA in a context of conflicting interests following the Arab Spring.

To advance these aims the project will ensure that policy-makers and practitioners are part of the overall project construction by including them in the project's advisory network and engaging with them through existing, and to be expanded, networks.

For the public and ancillary beneficiaries this project will:
- provide a series of engagement strategies to increase public awareness of the issues generated by the Arab Spring for the &amp;quot;Western&amp;quot; policy and demonstrate how it affects national security in the UK and similar states.
- Provide a skills base in CAQDAS, beyond academia, that has a proven track record of providing core and advanced research skills that benefit research well beyond the purview of the research project's core focus.

To raise public awareness, a documentary will be made that makes this research tangible and accessible to audiences beyond academia. This will be combined with updates through a facebook page and my existing twitter account. The training of skilled people beyond academia will be facilitated through the &amp;quot;how to use CAQDAS&amp;quot; CD Rom and workbook.

Overall this research project is on an important and timely subject, will employ innovative research methods on the international stage, maximise its impact across disciplines and build my own skills that will strengthen my ability to carry out important research of benefit to society in the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>168181</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Carnegie Endowment for International Peace</gtr:description><gtr:id>639C77F4-0168-4B1E-BC35-7A0DE30E8531</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>As part of this grant I have developed an ongoing relationship with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington DC, which is ranked as the third most influential foreign policy think tank in the world</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Learned Society</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>German Marshall Fund Invitation &amp; Talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2682E3AD-1F40-42E7-B9D6-899D89F436AE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In February 2015 I provided a high level closed door talk at the German Marshall Fund in Washington D.C.

This has involved multiple meetings and workshops with policy-makers in Brussels, Cairo, London, and Washington D.C. In addition to these meetings, however, there was an emphasis placed on fostering regional dialogue around the issues of democracy promotion and national security. Whilst it is often difficult to demonstrate the impact of such meetings, the project has provided demonstrable results. Most notably, this emerged from evidence supplied to the House of Common's Foreign Affairs Select Committee (HOCFASC). This was then published (Ev W35) and cited three times in the HOCFASC report on 'The UK's Response to Extremism and Political Instability in North and West Africa' (see reference notes 10, 12 and 46). With regards to references 10 and 12, they fell with the reports section 13 on the role of Religion in the Region, and the following paragraph was produced by the HOCFASC directly based on the evidence supplied: 

&amp;quot;These movements do not necessarily preach violent jihad but concerns have been expressed that they can amount to a gateway into even more extreme belief and activity. We noted evidence during the inquiry that some of these groups have become adept at spreading their beliefs by linking their hardline theology to the provision of practical assistance, often in areas where the state is failing in its duty to provide basic goods and services to ordinary people. We also heard evidence that many of these groups seek to spread a false narrative,
increasingly by use of modern media, that their values and beliefs are under attack from Western interests and their local proxies, and that ordinary Muslims are threatened. Ministers and officials have assented to the proposition that the UK and other Western aid-providers are in &amp;quot;a battle for hearts and minds&amp;quot; with these movements in much of sub-Saharan Africa. It was therefore somewhat concerning to hear that the UK Government has no current programme to monitor their spread within the region, and the impact it is having&amp;quot;.

In addition to this sections 25 &amp;amp; 26 of the report, on the Link with Terrorism and Extremism, cite the evidence supplied as footnote 46, stating the following paragraphs: 

&amp;quot;We have taken some time to set the scene in this way in order to make two related points that we consider to be fundamental, and to precede the more detailed discussion of terrorism and extremism that takes up the rest of this report. The first is that terrorism has begun to thrive in the region in large part because the environmental conditions for its growth appear to be near perfect. In the longer term, the goal should be to address those conditions.&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;To put this idea in context, the evidence we gathered during our inquiry indicates that the terrorist groups we discuss later in this report-groups such as AQIM, MUJAO and
Boko Haram-comprise a jumble of three main mindsets united around a common revolutionary cause. The cause was summarised by one of our witnesses as a &amp;quot;revolt from
the margins&amp;quot;; a religiously-inspired rebellion against a corrupt, unjust and sinful status quo, whilst the mindsets comprise those of the ideologue, the gangster, and the disaffected. Many of our witnesses considered that the key to addressing terrorism in the long-term was to focus on the disaffected, as it was they who could most easily be prised
away from the cause. The ranks of the disaffected primarily comprise under-employed young men who are likely to have become attached to terrorist groups through a mixture
of frustration, social pressure and poverty. One of our witnesses referred to young men in northern Nigeria being &amp;quot;pretty biddable to anyone who has got $2 a head in their pocket
and wants to cause trouble&amp;quot; whilst a Parliamentarian in northern Mali told us of how terrorists lured youths into the cause by offering them free jeeps for smuggling. Our witnesses stressed that many of these young men could be won back over to the mainstream if it was shown that that it could offer a better alternative. This might not wholly neutralise such groups-an ongoing security response would still be required-but it would significantly reduce their power and reach&amp;quot;.

In May 2014 the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs issued a formal Government Response to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs report to Parliament. This specifically responded to the Link with Terrorism and Extremism section that the evidence from this project had informed, and was the basis of it conclusions and recommendations. 

&amp;quot;Addressing terrorism in the Western Sahel-Sahara region comprehensively means addressing the environmental conditions that are allowing it to grow: poverty and inequality, corruption and mis-governance, the pressure of fast-growing populations on depleting natural resources, insufficient cross-border co-operation, and the spread of extremist ideology. This is a huge task requiring international co-operation across a number of disciplines. We see signs that development and investment challenges are beginning to be addressed, but are concerned that co-operation on security matters should not be neglected.

The Government agrees that a holistic approach to tackling the problems that face the Western Sahel-Sahara region is needed. International co-ordination is essential and security co-operation an important element of this. That is why the UK supports the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) and the EU Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel, both of which seek to harness the combined resources of the international community to tackle the wide range of challenges facing the Sahel ...&amp;quot;

&amp;quot;We recognise that the UK Government has sought to secure international cooperation, for instance through the communiqu&amp;eacute; agreed at the 2013 G8 summit. We recommend that the UK Government, in its response to this report, outlines how it proposes to maintain momentum on this issue over the remainder of this Parliament, particularly in relation to security and intelligence co-operation.&amp;quot;

Accordingly, there is a demonstrable record of impact from the research carried out under this project, the submission of evidence Ev W35, it use and citation in the report, the government response and the adoption of the government's conclusions and recommendations.</gtr:description><gtr:id>C311CDD5-E48E-4D8E-AC7B-9D9CD3A1336A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This research has made significant advances in understanding how the US and EU have engaged with the Middle East and North Africa following the Arab Awakening. The research has identified that 1) the US and the EU balance their external approaches to democracy and security in the Middle East and North Africa through the lens of a &amp;quot;neoliberal-security paradigm&amp;quot;. This policy seeks to promote a democratic transition in the long-term whilst also allowing transatlantic elites to pursue more immediate security interests in counter-terrorism and counter-proliferation cooperation, the implementation of the Arab-Israeli peace treaty, and migration amongst other interests. Rather than abandoning this approach in the post-revolutionary environment, the transatlantic approach has continued on this path even as it has faced considerable &amp;quot;push-back&amp;quot;. 2) Within the context of the Egyptian case study, it was discovered that this approach combined with foreign aid altered internal military incentives in Egypt, which complicated the post-revolutionary environment. The research termed this, &amp;quot;the $74 billion problem&amp;quot; that has created an Egyptian-Military-industrial-commercial complex that threatens the likelihood of any democratic transition in the country for the foreseeable future. 3) Within the context of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia case study, it was argued that Saudi Arabia was pushing back against the transatlantic approach, but this was not to challenge &amp;quot;democracy&amp;quot; per say, nor due to religious doctrine, but rather because of the way Saudi foreign policy elites desire to secure a) the maintenance of the House of Saud; b) the preservation of security and order within Saudi Arabia; c) the possibility of an alternative Islamic model of state emerging in the region; and d) containing Iranian influence. With closer scrutiny, what emerges is a multifaceted picture of Saudi Arabia adopting country specific responses to the Arab awakening. 4) With regards to the Moroccan case study, it was discovered that increasingly the political dissent has moved into socio-cultural spaces making confrontation with the monarchy less pronounced and more sporadic. These findings highlight that the Middle East and North Africa is on a downward trajectory of spiralling violence and the US and the EU have been ill equipped intellectually to deal with the post-Arab Awakening environment. This has become coupled with a more inwardly looking approach and less willingness to act in the region. Indeed, as neoliberalism is becoming increasingly challenged by populism at home and abroad, elites have yet to rise to the challenge of these critical junctures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>I will continue to take this research forward by disseminating it within academic, policy-maker and public spheres. Within the academy this will include the continued publication of results that provide an alternative framing to the &amp;quot;Democracy vs. Interests&amp;quot; debate. This has been a successful strategy evidenced by the significant readership of the articles already produced as a result of this research funding. With policymakers, I will continue to build on the extensive relationships I have developed throughout the research-funding period, and continue to offer my expertise and knowledge to select committees and requests from the policymaking community. This will build on the project's existing track record of providing written evidence for parliamentary reports and oral evidence to policy makers directly in the UK, US and EU. To raise public awareness, I will continue in my efforts to provide talks and disseminate the knowledge produced under this research funding to written and broadcast media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>BBE97D77-1C39-4C61-AB0C-96A029E3A6C0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/people/hassan/publications/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in FCO Roundtable on the UK approach to the ENP</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>959BCAE6-9E73-4EA3-8A11-30D8B4350B34</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>US Pentagon SMA Technical Lecture Series Participation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>North America</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7B888B67-8DF1-45E7-9D5D-B94C8090945E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>MA/PhD Advanced Qualitative Research Skills Training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>583A630A-A8CC-464F-8D88-720DA7DEA896</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>FCO US-Iran Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9104F420-3F33-447C-8A85-E2E4DBB7FC40</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>The FCO's Human Rights work in 2013</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4100AB96-D74F-4F6B-9C50-532393962FD8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/foreign-affairs-committee/news/fcos-human-rights-work/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee Report: The UK's response to extremism and instability in North and West Africa</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61EEB88E-6F74-4C5F-97E7-D29E40112B0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research was cited in the report on three occasions - see footnotes 10, 12 &amp;amp; 46.

We recommend that the UK Government, in its response to this report, outlines how it proposes to maintain momentum on this issue over the remainder of this Parliament, particularly in relation to security and intelligence co-operation.&amp;quot;


Notably the Government response to this can be found here (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/313859/40581_Cm_8861_accessible.pdf) and includes the following direct response to the concerned paragraphs outlined above in the report:

Paragraph 29 response: &amp;quot;The Government agrees that a holistic approach to tackling the problems that face the Western Sahel-Sahara region is needed. International co-ordination is essential and security co-operation an important element of this. That is why the UK supports the UN Integrated Strategy for the Sahel (UNISS) and the EU Strategy for Security and Development in the Sahel, both of which seek to harness the combined resources of the international community to tackle the wide range of challenges facing the Sahel.
Examples of security co-operation, where the UK is contributing, include the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilisation Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) and the various EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) missions in Mali, Niger and Libya. In West Africa, the National Crime Agency's (NCA) regional manager is regional co&amp;shy; ordinator for an EU project aimed at weakening the capacity of organised crime to traffic cocaine and heroin to and within the EU. Home Office and NCA are active in the G8 West Africa Transnational Organised Crime Group and used the UK's Chairmanship in 2013 to press for closer international co-operation on this issue, including increased support for ECOWAS in implementation of the West Africa Praia
??
Plan to combat drug trafficking and organised crime in the region. Other international work includes the regional security training exercise Operation Flintlock involving 16 countries from Africa and outside the continent, including the UK, which fosters regional co-operation to support Counter Terrorism (CT) and stabilisation activities in North and West Africa. The most recent exercise was held in Niger in February 2014.
Together with Denmark, the UK is funding, through the Africa Conflict Pool Programme (ACPP), a conflict prevention and border security capacity building project in the Niger/Mali/Burkina Faso region. Its purpose is to build greater capacity in local communities and government bodies to work together to reduce armed violence in the shared 'Gourma' border area.&amp;quot;

Paragraph 30 response: &amp;quot;The Government has worked to translate the Lough Erne Communiqu&amp;eacute; language on combating terrorism into practical activity. For instance we have held high-level discussions with G8 partners directly and through the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum which has taken forward specific initiatives in the Sahel-Sahara region. The UK has supported a number of GCTF workshops to improve information sharing, and coordination of CT efforts in the region in 2014. The Government will continue to pursue initiatives begun at Lough Erne for the remainder of this Parliament and beyond.
A wide range of government departments have regular exchanges with partners on security and intelligence matters. This co-operation takes place in a number of multilateral and bilateral arenas as well as in the region, through exercises such as Operation Flintlock and the EU and UN programmes. As mentioned above, the Government believes security co-operation is, and will continue to be, essential to tackling the problems facing the region.&amp;quot;
