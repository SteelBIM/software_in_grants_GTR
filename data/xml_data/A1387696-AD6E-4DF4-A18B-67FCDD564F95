&lt;p>Adolescence is a period that is surrounded by social and cultural expectations, influenced by notions of normality. Disability complicates such expectations as those around disabled young people often make assumptions about how 'normal' the young person can be. The disabled young person may not necessarily agree with such expectations and views, but nevertheless they have to live with and deal with such expectations, alongside other factors that influence adolescence, such as gender and sexuality.&lt;/p>

Those narratives enact a distinct body that is constructed as distant from the norm and therefore 'damaged' but also fixable. In this seminar we explore how such narratives, and the practices they encompass, influence the stories disabled young people tell about their bodies and impairment. Drawing on interviews carried out with seventeen disabled young people over two projects, we explore the way medical and societal responses to bodily difference become part of the stories disabled young people tell about their bodies, and influence the way they work with the body as something which remains 'unfinished' and therefore both fixable and flawed. A narrative of an unfinished body is produced, as young people work with the body as something that is integral to their emerging identity, but also as a potential threat that could undermine and give away their labour in making an 'ordinary' functioning body and life.

The young people's discussions of how their bodies influenced their interactions with others, highlighted how social dynamics turn impairment - a different way a body functions and looks - into a disability - a bodily difference that is significant in a person's social position in the world - often to their detriment. Those social dynamics are constituted through both body narratives and practices and are open to challenge via the way impairment can be enacted - through doing things in different and creative ways - and framed - through being seen as an important part of someone's identity - as something valued. 

Imperatives to Fix
The participants in their previous and contemporary interviews spoke of the body as one that was involved in ongoing interventions; there was continuity in how medical interventions that occurred in childhood - such as surgeries and physiotherapy - continued into adolescence. However, in adolescence the young people had more say in what medical interventions occurred and also developed their own everyday interventions, which used activities such as walking, or doing things for themselves, as opportunities to maintain body strength and mobility. The focus on interventions across their life course maintained a sense of their bodies as unfinished and likely to require new and further interventions as the ageing process continued to affect the work that needed to be done. In this way impairment was both permanent - always there - and changing - always altering due to factors such as the body ageing or growing. 

Transitions
The body work the young people did and showed us was also influenced by their thoughts about the future. They spoke about and used imagery they produced to highlight their desire to be independent, to live on their own, to be like their friends and live 'ordinary', normal lives. Work they did to keep mobile, strong, fit, looking normal, was influenced by thinking about the work they had to do to become full adult citizens. The way such transitions were articulated was one aspect of their disabled embodiment that was gendered. For example, the ways in which body strength was worked at, and articulated, and the importance given to being self-reliant in order to have a family, were discussed differently by the young men and women. 

Pain 
Participants made distinctions between 'everyday pain' and pain they linked to their physical impairments. They saw everyday pain - for example, getting tired from walking too far - as something that was part of life and they took pride in their ability to work through such pain. Pain they associated with impairment was something they had to manage that others did not. The pain of everyday life they worked through to show their similarity to others; the pain of impairment was something they framed as a barrier to developing their bodies as they would like and their adult futures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic researchers can make use of the research to consider the interrelationship between identity formation, social and medical regulation and embodied practice and resistance in disabled young people's lives.
