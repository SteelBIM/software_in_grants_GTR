Further, it is now widely accepted that nutrition during early life (including fetal life and early infancy) may 'programme' our future risk of a wide array of non-communicable diseases; the so called 'Developmental Origins of Health and Disease' (DOHaD) hypothesis. Taken together, this understanding of the importance of both the immediate and longer-term health consequences of undernutrition during our early life period, has placed a much greater focus on a 'life-course' strategy for disease prevention, recognising that there are periods in early-life that provide a 'window of opportunity' for nutrition interventions aimed at improving life-long health. In populations with widespread maternal and infant undernutrition, optimising growth during this critical phase of development is fundamental for improving health. The key ambition of this research is to provide an evidence base on the mechanisms that link undernutrition to growth failure, so effective interventions can be designed. 

To meet this ambition, this research will focus on four main objectives:

1. To improve our understanding of what 'normal' and 'abnormal' fetal and infant development, with a specific focus on growth and brain development.
2. To identify mechanisms through which maternal nutrition (before and during pregnancy) impacts on fetal and infant growth and brain development.
3. To advance our understanding of the mechanisms linking infant nutrition to growth and development, with a specific focus on maternal nutrition and breast milk quality.
4. To use this research to identify possible nutrition interventions for improvements in women's nutrition and infant health outcomes globally, and to test these interventions in new trials.

This research will largely be focused in low- and middle-income settings, but with implications for nutritionally vulnerability globally.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The overall aim of my research is to identify mechanisms through which maternal and infant nutrition may impact on maternal health and influence infant development and hence identify pathways by which nutritional interventions to mothers and/or infants can be effective. The specific focus is on the nutritional regulation of 'healthy' fetal and infant growth, and in gaining a detailed understanding of the mechanisms underpinning this. The research is concentrated on vulnerable populations, especially mothers and infants in settings of widespread undernutrition in resource poor settings, but with implications for nutritional inequalities globally. 

Within this overall aim, the specific objectives of this research are to:
1. Improve understanding of normal and abnormal fetal and infant development, utilising detailed phenotypic data from existing and ongoing birth cohort studies and focusing specifically on growth and brain development.
2. Identify mechanisms through which maternal nutrition impact on fetal and infant growth and brain development.
3. Identify mechanisms linking infant nutrition to growth and brain development, with a specific focus on maternal nutrition and breast milk quality.
4. Identify and test nutritional interventions for improvements in women's nutrition and infant health outcomes globally.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who might benefit from this research?
Beyond the academic community, it is anticipated that this work will provide impact primarily through the provision of information that is relevant to public health professionals, clinicians and global health practitioners.

How might they benefit from this research?
In addition to the immediate health consequences of undernutrition, it is now widely accepted that the early life environment (especially the early life nutritional environment) has lifelong effects on human health. The 'Developmental Origins of Health and Disease' (DOHaD) hypothesis is built on a substantial body of evidence from epidemiological, animal and human intervention studies and demonstrates associations between the early environment and a wide range of health outcomes. These data have placed a much greater emphasis on a lifecourse strategy for disease prevention, recognising that there are periods in early life that provide a window of opportunity for both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive interventions. A comprehensive understanding of the timing and mode of action of early nutrition is therefore needed before interventions can be developed for lifelong health. Within this portfolio of work, I seek to understand these mechanisms and provide tangible targets - accessible to both the academic and non-academic communities - for intervention to improve infant and childhood growth and development.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-07-05</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-06</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>784965</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/P012019/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>160D22D0-5677-4513-A0AC-7F3526B7F336</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Metabolic and Endocrine</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>CF950C9A-DB16-4E23-8AEB-94548777BCA1</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.1  Normal biological development and functioning</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
