&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to understand the dominant patterns of expenditure among older people&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to explore how patterns of consumer borrowing, financial inclusion and over-indebtedness vary into and beyond retirement&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to determine the main components of wealth and how these vary into and beyond retirement&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to establish the relationship between financial well-being and quality of life among older people.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The methods used will include cluster analysis, multilevel analysis, multivariate logistic regression and longitudinal analysis. Seven major survey data sources (five with a UK/English focus and two international) will be analysed, complemented by a rigorous framework analysis of two qualitative datasets using specialist qualitative software.

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>producing a comprehensive research report&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>submitting three articles to policy-relevant peer-reviewed journals&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>hosting a research symposium&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>a range of seminars and methodological presentations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>presenting our work at three conferences.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from the research?

-Academics and other research professionals, particularly those with an interest in older people's wealth and expenditure, consumption patterns and financial well-being; poverty and social exclusion; social policy; the use of large-scale datasets; advanced quantitative reseach methods; comparative data analysis.

-Policymakers and policy-focused organisations (e.g. parliamentarians, government departments, regulators, think tanks such as the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, New Economics Foundation)

-Charities and other stakeholders with an interest in the practical and policy implications of the research (e.g. Age UK, Independent Age)

-The private sector (e.g. financial services providers)

-The wider public

How will they benefit from the research?

We currently lack policy-relevant quantitative research on the financial dimensions of well-being in older age. This research will provide new knowledge of older people's wealth, expenditure, consumption and patterns of financial well-being derived from major high-quality data sources and complemented by secondary analysis of qualitative data. By actively engaging academics, policy-makers, charities and the public and private sectors we can work towards ensuring that the specific needs of older people are recognised and appropriately addressed. In the longer term older people may benefit from changes to policy and practice brought about or informed by this research.

In order to ensure effective academic impact, we will seek to publish research findings in leading international peer-reviewed journals (particularly those with specific interests in social policy, economics and ageing). To enable other academics and research professionals to better exploit these rich data sources, the final research report will have technical appendices which detail the datasets and the approaches we have used. We will disseminate the research findings via presentations at a range of national, European and international conferences; through existing seminar programmes run by ILC and University of Bristol; and through presentations at survey user group meetings and similar events. The derived datasets from the research will be made available on request via University of Bristol's Research Data Storage Facility.

To maximise the potential economic and societal benefits we will hold a one day research symposium in London, inviting parliamentarians, representatives from relevant government departments, ageing charities and think tanks, and leading academics. We will also hold a seminar, via the University's Centre for Public Engagement, to bring the research to the attention of the wider public. Final outputs will be published on the University and ILC websites and distributed using our extensive networks, using a strategy that will promote and influence, as well as build new relationships. Our strategy will combine traditional dissemination activities (e.g. ILC's 5000-strong mailing list, press releases via ILC and the University, working with the national print media and specialist press) with an appropriate new media strategy that exploits ILC's expertise in the effective use of social media (e.g. LinkedIn, Twitter, blogs).

We routinely use our research evidence to more directly influence and inform policy. Both PFRC and ILC have well-established relationships with government ministers and government departments, the financial services industry and other relevant stakeholders. ILC and PFRC are regularly invited to provide verbal and written evidence to assist government enquiries (most recently PFRC provided evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills enquiry into Debt Management ). Both ILC and PFRC are experienced in producing policy briefings and presenting research evidence to a wide-range of audiences.

The collaboration between the University of Bristol's Personal Finance Research Centre and our non-academic partner the International Longevity Centre UK (ILC-UK) has successfully demonstrated how academic and non-academic institutions can, together, utilise research findings to inform and influence the way the public, media, policymakers and practitioners think about these subjects.

The research findings have been shared and used beyond academia to influence policy and practice relating to older people's financial wellbeing, by offering knowledge and evidence-based resources, as well as a variety of engagement routes, to encourage informed policy-making. We have very effectively engaged a wide range of stakeholders by convening high-profile, well-attended events to showcase research from this project, as well as providing a platform for others to respond to our research findings and share their own insights. 

In 2013, we convened an industry-hosted Expert Round Table on 'Understanding the Older Consumer', based around our analysis of the Living Costs and Food Survey. It was attended by senior representatives from marketing, consumer organisations, policymakers (including representatives from the Financial Conduct Authority), and journalists (e.g. Financial Times) who all expressed keen interest in the analysis of high-quality public data sources to better understand the spending patterns of older consumers. ILC-UK have followed-up this work extensively, producing blogs, policy briefings and entering into discussions with potential funders for further work in this area. The University of Bristol is seeking research funding to conduct further secondary data analysis, in particular to explore spending on alcohol and alcohol consumption among older people. 

In autumn 2013, we convened a Private Breakfast Debate, in partnership with StepChange Debt Charity, during the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, chaired by Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, a Labour Peer and Chair of Step Change Debt Charity. The title of the debate was 'Tackling problem debt in old age: What are the policy challenges and how can these be addressed?' It was attended by organisations including AgeUK, the BBC, Mail on Sunday, Prudential, the Association of British Credit Unions Limited and Macmillan Cancer Support. As well as presenting our analysis of older people's use of secured and unsecured credit, there were presentations by the Chief Executive of AgeUK and ILC-UK, as well as a response to the presentations from Stepchange's Head of Policy. We also convened a Private Dinner Debate at the same conference, which included a presentation by the relationship charity Relate on money and relationships in later life. 

In March 2014, we launched our report 'Financial Wellbeing in Later Life: Evidence and Policy' which described the main findings and policy implications from this research project. Held in central London, the launch event was chaired by Paul Lewis (a prominent financial journalist and presenter of Radio 4's respected Money Box programme). It was attended by around 130 people including policymakers, industry and academics (see below). As well as presenting our findings from the research, there were contributions from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Step Change Debt Charity. We received very positive feedback from participants, who commented in particular on the diverse and engaged audience, which included AgeUK, the Money Advice Service, the Financial Times, BBC News, Which?, the Guardian, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Department for Work and Pensions, Legal and General, Barclays, the Money Charity, Macmillan Cancer Support, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Institute for Fiscal Studies, Deloitte, Help Age International, Alzheimer's Society, Lloyds Banking Group, Saga and Public Health England. The report has been downloaded almost 700 times since its launch.

At a seminar co-hosted by ILC-UK and HelpAge International in London, we presented World Vales Survey analysis on the links between older people's finances and their wellbeing to around 50 policymakers, industry and academics. The research was also presented at a Westminster All Party Parliamentary Group joint round table discussion on Debt and Personal Finance and Mental Health attended by around forty stakeholders and chaired by Yvonne Fovargue MP. This event led to Co-I Hayes securing further funding from the ESRC's Impact Acceleration Account (see below).

The research has been used to shape media and societal responses to well-being in older age. We have shared our research through frequent press releases, short and accessible research briefings, blogs and podcasts that explain the findings in clear and non-technical language. Our findings have been widely reported on in the national and local press; within professional journals; and on the radio. We have actively used social media to extend the reach of our findings and stimulate debate, including sharing findings with ILC-UK's 4,700 Twitter followers. 

Such dissemination routes are particularly important given the prominent role of media and public opinion in shaping the debates that ultimately inform policies which impact on older people. For example, our working paper on levels of mortgage borrowing and over-indebtedness among older households was published jointly by PFRC and ILC-UK and accompanied by press releases and Tweets. This piece alone generated more than 200 news reports worldwide, including newspaper articles (e.g. Mail Online), an Independent newspaper blog and a BBC radio interview with the primary author; it also received direct interest from a concerned member of the public (who could be referred to appropriate advice services), and from DEFRA's Rural Communities Policy Unit. 

The findings of the research continue to be used extensively by the International Longevity Centre-UK at public consultations and to inform research briefings. They have presented the research at a number of events over the past year to mixed audiences of policy and practice experts.

The ESRC study has acted as a catalyst for further work in this field, in particular the formation of an expert group of senior stakeholders, policymakers and academics to look at the relationship between mental health and financial well-being, supported by the ESRC Impact Acceleration Account. One outcome of this expert group has been a collaboration that resulted in a programme of research on consumer vulnerability in financial services, led by PFRC and funded by the financial services industry. 

In 2016/2017, using a second award from the ESRC Impact Acceleration Account we plan to hold a series of problem-solving expert events around financial and mental well-being. One of the events, in Scotland in November 2017, will focus on older people and well-being. Others focus on suicide and debt; and gambling and debt. At the events, participants are asked to commit to taking a 'Small Step' after the event to make a difference to policy or practice. We will follow up with participants to see if and how they have carried out their 'Small Steps' and any impacts from them.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>12E987B5-9666-4A18-A560-5DAE96693540</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EC7C30D0-8238-457F-8F0B-120E424BB8BF"><gtr:id>EC7C30D0-8238-457F-8F0B-120E424BB8BF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Understanding the oldest old</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a0bbcbe630c5ba91f780989cf3e19ccd"><gtr:id>a0bbcbe630c5ba91f780989cf3e19ccd</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Hayes, D.
