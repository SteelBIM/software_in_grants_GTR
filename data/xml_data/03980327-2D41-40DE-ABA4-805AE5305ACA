probes the growth strategies of innovative small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Our research focuses on emerging green goods industries that manufacture outputs which benefit the environment or conserve natural resources, with an international comparative element involving the UK, the US, and China.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project investigates the contributions of strategy, resources and relationships to how innovative British, American, and Chinese SMEs achieve significant growth. The targeted technology-oriented green goods sectors are strategically important to environmental rebalancing and have significant potential (in the UK) for export growth. The research examines the diverse pathways to innovation and growth across different regions. We use a mix of methodologies, including analyses of structured and unstructured data on SME business and technology performance and strategies, case studies, and modelling. Novel approaches using web mining are pioneered to gain timely information about enterprise developmental pathways. Findings from the project will be used to inform management and policy development at enterprise, regional and national levels.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project is led by the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research at the University of Manchester, in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology, US; Beijing Institute of Technology, China, and Experian, UK.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research in the near and mid-term will include business, government, and intermediaries. Management insights will be developed and disseminated of value to enterprise managers, including those in technology-oriented start-up and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to business support programmes, and to those who undertake investment, financial, and procurement activities with innovative SMEs. Policy insights will be developed and disseminated to university and other technology transfer managers, and to local and national policymakers. Included among these users are the newly-formed local enterprise partnerships, other local economic and business development organizations, and agencies in the devolved administrations. Given our sector focus on green goods industries, we also value in the findings from companies and organizations involved in energy, environment, and low-carbon production and consumption. Methodological techniques (for developing business intelligence from unstructured enterprise web sites) will be of benefit to users in the academic and non-academic worlds, including other researchers, students, management analysts, and consultancies. In the longer term, potential beneficiaries also include metropolitan and regional communities that will benefit economically, socially, and environmentally from the additional jobs, products, and clean and renewable technologies that could accrue through management and policy actions influenced by this research and associated knowledge spillovers. 

The user groups will benefit from the research if the findings from the project stimulate changes in management strategy and policy actions that result in (a) additions to the number of SMEs that experience sustained growth in scale and scope in multiple regional agglomerations around the UK; and (b) are successful at home and abroad in marketing products and technologies that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources. Major changes in management strategy and policy take time and effort; the contributions of this project to such changes will be through new knowledge generation, the international comparative elements (learning is often facilitated through comparison), the development of clear and actionable recommendations, the new methodologies developed, training activities, and the active dissemination of results to the user groups directly (workshops and events) and indirectly (media, blogs, web presence, and linkages with other organizations).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>260541</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Georgia Institute of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Innovation Co-Lab</gtr:description><gtr:id>FC1F39CF-44D4-4A66-948D-0C7A7EE6BE3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outcomes from this collaboration include 2010, British Council seed funds; 2012 - involvement of HSE Moscow as an associated partner; 2012 - award of ESRC support for collaborative projects including the ESRC project on Emerging Technologies, Trajectories and Implications of Next Generation Innovation Systems; 2013, Designation of the Co-Lab as Innovation Base (Beijing Municipal Government); 2010-present, student exchanges; Conferences (IM2012, Beijing); Atlanta (2013); Academies (2013, 2014) and 2014 International Summer School on Emerging Technologies (Manchester).

A Policy Workshop on Sustaining Growth for Innovative Enterprises was held in London on 04 December 2014, co-organized by the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research and the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). The workshop presented results and discussed policy implications from the ESRC Project on Sustaining Growth for Innovative Enterprises. Presentations at the workshop were made by Philip Shapira, Abdullah G&amp;ouml;k, Marianne Sensier, and Elvira Uyarra. Additional input was provided by Mike Newman (ORE Catapult), Susanne Baker (EEF), Stephen Roper (Warwick University), Mark Franks (BIS) and Alan Harding (University of Liverpool). Other workshop participants were drawn from government, business organizations, research councils, non-profits, and academia. The project is probing differential strategies for SME growth and the role of regional clustering and policy resources in the growth of innovative companies, building on new and unobtrusive methods of web mining to gain timely information about enterprise developmental pathways. Research is focusing on the emerging green goods sector (comprising firms producing outputs that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources) with an international comparative element involving the UK, the US, and China. Papers, background reports, and the workshop presentation materials are available via http://bit.ly/sustaining-innovation. Opportunities for question and answer and open discussion were offered. About 35 people attend the workshop.

We received business and policy follow-up interest in obtaining more information about the results of the project, and will leverage this network to further disseminate information about the project findings to policy, business, and intermediaries.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://sustaininggrowth.eventbrite.co.uk</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Sustaining Growth for Innovative New Enterprises - Co-Lab and Project Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>37463E4C-A45D-41BE-855C-8D8AF8B46D20</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop brought together research team members of the project on Sustaining Growth for Innovative New Enterprises of the Innovation Co-Lab of the University of Manchester, Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Beijing Institute of Technology.

Exporting is also important for British firms; and innovative green goods SMEs are found in multiple locations in Britain, a positive finding in terms of rebalancing.

In China, rapid growth in green goods SMEs has been particularly dependent on government promotion of renewable energy sectors. But following recent declines in such areas as solar panel manufacturing due to over-production and reduced international demand, some Chinese firms are pivoting into more advanced technologies.

Variations in British firms' performance by sector highlight the influence of policy. SMEs in renewable energy equipment have seen relatively strong overall sales and job growth over the last decade, but performance has been weaker in green building technologies. Policy has encouraged offshore wind energy generation, yet proven weaker in supporting energy efficient homes and buildings. In general, SMEs in Britain are still experiencing difficulties in accessing early stage finance, which raises concerns about the UK's fragmented support landscape and a regulatory environment that lacks the predictability needed to provide incentives for long-term investment</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The methods developed have been, and will be, taken forward and developed by the research team and by other researchers to use in further projects. This includes web mining of business strategies of firms in innovative materials sectors (graphene) for Nesta (in progress). The findings will be useful for UK policymakers, businesses, and intermediaries at national and local levels in terms of intelligence for policy and management actions. The findings will assist in bench-marking UK efforts to support growth in innovative manufacturing SMEs in comparison with the US and China. Analyses developed by the project will also be helpful to UK SMEs seeking to compete with US or Chinese firms in the UK, the US, China, and other markets.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>D552F858-DDBC-41EE-ACB8-EC6952468FFD</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://research.mbs.ac.uk/innovation/Research/Currentprojects/SustainingGrowthforInnovativeNewEnterprises.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in Manufacturing Commission Report &amp;quot;Making British Manufacturing Sustainable.&amp;quot;</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>6ECA8773-EE75-4088-9CCE-F8A910B05705</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.policyconnect.org.uk/apmg/sites/site_apmg/files/industrial_evolution_final_single-paged.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Narrative in Britain in 2015</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>349882AE-0809-407B-9D6E-443CE985AAB0</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/magazines-and-newsletters/britain-in/britain-in-2015-jobs/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evidence Briefing (ESRC)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A1A55338-8EFD-4C7D-9716-CC3DC92870EC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/news-events-and-publications/evidence-briefings/support-for-green-goods-businesses/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The database contains anonymous firm data from a sample of UK firms (N=304) engaged in green goods production.
