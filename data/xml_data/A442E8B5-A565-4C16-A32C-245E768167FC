They result in major physical and psychological burden on many individuals. They also have huge impact on UK health system and economy. A few representative examples include: endometriosis which affects 1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the UK and cost the UK economy &amp;pound;8.2 billion a year in treatment, loss of work and healthcare costs; stillbirth - there are more than 3,600 stillbirths every year in the UK, and one in every 200 births ends in a stillbirth; and ovarian cancer that in UK alone kills nearly 12 women every day. Importantly, reproductive health problems are often linked to lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, but these links are not completely understood. 

The Medical Research Council - Centre for Reproductive Health in Edinburgh (MRC-CRH) is the only UK-based reproductive health/biology centre that brings together basic scientists, diagnosticians and clinicians specialising in health, biology and pathology of reproductive system and reproductive processes at all levels: from genes and molecules to population based studies and lifestyle-disease links. The Centre is located in the world-renowned Queen's Medical Research Institute in the direct proximity of the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (a teaching hospital for the University of Edinburgh Medical School run by NHS Lothian), a few other top class research institutions and a commercialisation incubator (Edinburgh BioQuarter). This optimises the use of resources, increases interdisciplinary collaborations and enhances commercialisation activities. Over the past five years the Centre grew significantly in both staff numbers and its research output and proved its value to society, for example, a single &amp;quot;STOPPIT&amp;quot; study on efficiency of progesterone treatment in preterm birth prevented 11,000 patients from painful ineffective treatment in the UK alone saving NHS &amp;pound;M annually. 

Within the next five years we intend to build on our past achievements to boost MRC-CRH research/education potential and infrastructure of the Centre. The main aims of this project are to (i) consolidate and reinforce MRC-CRH scientific activities, (ii) increase the Centre's educational role, and (iii) enhance interactions of the Centre's investigators and students with patients, medical practitioners and general public, rising awareness about reproductive health conditions and other topics related to our research. MRC funds will be used to (a) purchase specialised equipment that will increase research capability and open new frontiers for future investigations (micro-injection and oocyte handling, sophisticated interference and fluorescent microscopy), (b) recruit necessary expert personnel in imaging technology, database management/bioinformatics and scientific communication to sustain/expand our research capacity and outreach activities, (c) establish a top quality PhD programme in reproductive health/biology for clinical and non-clinical scientists.

It is our ambition through another five years of MRC funding to maintain and expand our world-class research into new areas including cancers of the reproductive tract, the effects of life-style (obesity, smoking etc.) on reproductive health and proliferative disorders of the reproductive system. It is our aim that our discoveries will impact the health and well-being of the Nation's population through their entire life-span. This improvement in health will have significant consequences for individuals, families and the society in general with noticeable economic benefits.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The MRC-CRH will integrate its proven strengths in reproductive health and biology (training, multilevel basic/clinical research, clinical trials and implementation of new treatments/procedures) around four scientific themes linking basic and clinical researchers to enhance translational output: (1) Reproductive resilience, proliferation, differentiation and repair; (2) Reproductive system cancers: aetiology, pathogenesis and therapy; (3) Optimizing life-long health through pregnancy and perinatal interventions; (4) Immune-endocrine interactions in reproductive health. These will be reinforced by a dedicated interdisciplinary reproductive health/biology PhD training programme (3-4 years) for both clinical and non-clinical scientists. The programme will produce and sustain a generation of new academic/clinical reproductive health/biology experts increasing UK research capacity in this important field. Emphasis will be put on extending our current research infrastructure by implementing state-of-the-art technologies in micro-injection and oocyte handling and increasing our capabilities for in situ quantitative monitoring of biological processes using real-time intravital fluorescent and interference microscopy. This will be associated with recruitment of imaging specialist and database manager to maintain the systems, provide training and facilitate image processing, analysis and bioinformatics. We intend to enhance our general public training/education activities and online presence which will be facilitated by recruitment of a dedicated scientific communications manager.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Diverse aspects of reproductive biology/health influence the society at multiple levels (health/wellbeing, lifestyle, culture, economy etc.) and are essential for survival of mankind. Basic, translational and clinical research performed at the MRC-CRH impacts a number of people, organisations and sectors in the population at local, national and global scale. Main non-academic beneficiaries of our activities include:
(a) Policymakers, public health educators and general population. Our research and clinical trials continuously provide data that directly informs many guidelines for treatment and lifestyle advice for the population. This is facilitated by MRC-CRH members siting in various advisory bodies linked to organisations playing leading roles in policy development nationally and internationally (e.g. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; World Health Organisation). Usually it takes at least a few years (2-5) to convey MRC-CRH generated clinical data into active public policies but we have also examples of much faster impact (e.g. results of &amp;quot;Outcomes of elective induction of labour compared to expectant management: a population based study&amp;quot; translated into international policy changes in less than 2 years from original publication (Stock et al. BMJ. 2012;344:e2838)). Our studies will inform the health of all of society, for example investigations on the effects of obesity, smoking and stress on pregnancy will lead to lifestyle advice to the population. Similarly studies in contraception (particularly male contraceptives), if successful, may lead to alteration in behaviour.
(b) Patients, their relatives and friends. Patients benefit from our research directly through ability to use new therapeutic approaches (e.g. MRC-CRH Anderson co-developed new procedures and protocols for freezing of ovarian tissue to allow women to have children after cancer therapy), possibility to get exposed to novel (potentially life-changing) therapies at clinical trial stage and patient-directed educational activities, and indirectly through improved health policies and practices that we impact. Pregnancy and healthy birth are not only life-changing events for a woman but they usually also have enormous impact on her family and friends. Routine induction of labour at 39 weeks for all women stemming from our research is calculated to prevent the perinatal death of 500 babies per year and we will continue our efforts to further improve this figure.
(c) NHS and health system. Our research influences NHS standards and operating procedures, it also leads to identification of improved or ineffective treatments and significant savings/ better allocation of resources in the health system (e.g. STOPPIT study led by Norman showed that progesterone was ineffective in women with tween pregnancy and has prevented ineffective treatment of 11,000 women annually with huge savings for NHS). Our research often targets conditions that increase morbidity without being life-threatening (e.g. endometriosis, fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding), these conditions are associated with enormous strain on the health system and big economic costs through loss of work. 
(d) Medical practitioners. These people benefit from our contributions to general medical knowledge (e.g. Pollard's research has been described in textbooks such as &amp;quot;Molecular Biology of the Cell&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Pathophysiology&amp;quot; where his work is featured on the front cover.), regular training opportunities and increased patient/general public awareness about reproductive system health and diseases promoted by MRC-CRH. 
(e) Economy and commerce. Our spinout company Ichthus Therapeutics is developing novel products focused on women's health (in particular endometriosis and endometriosis-associated pelvic pain). Within the next 5 years we plan to spin out additional companies and facilitate increase in job opportunities and capital gain generated by them with direct benefit for local economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2021-09-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1444459</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">MR/N022556/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories><gtr:healthCategory><gtr:id>FA7AA693-7EDD-4A7E-8CA3-6B5658FBF717</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Reproductive Health and Childbirth</gtr:text></gtr:healthCategory></gtr:healthCategories><gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>1A41A859-2076-46E6-B80F-CE4E1E8EDC1D</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>1.5  Resources and infrastructure (underpinning)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>93C4699B-9E5C-4982-9CCC-EFD5B9712D6E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>2.6  Resources and infrastructure (aetiology)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>A056411B-DD7A-4062-BE33-7849FBC9BFA7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>5.9  Resources and infrastructure (development of treatments)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity><gtr:researchActivity><gtr:id>208C592B-C1B7-4E87-A19A-04E8D9458E50</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>25</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>6.9  Resources and infrastructure (evaluation of treatments)</gtr:text></gtr:researchActivity></gtr:researchActivities><gtr:researchSubjects/><gtr:researchTopics/><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
