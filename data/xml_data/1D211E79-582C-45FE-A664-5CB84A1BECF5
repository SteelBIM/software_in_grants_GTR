Psychological research has demonstrated that how people behave is influenced by perceptions of how other people behave in similar situations and by the opinions of others about what is appropriate behaviour in a given context.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In relation to eating behaviour, people look to others as a guide for how much to eat and the presence of other people in eating situations can guide food selection. This suggests that one way of encouraging healthier eating is to provide information about the healthy eating habits of others. This approach has been used successfully to reduce unhealthy consumption of alcoholic drinks but has yet to be applied to eating behaviour.&amp;nbsp;To address this, a series of experiments will be conducted in which participants will be exposed to posters and flyers that provide information about the healthy eating behaviour of others. Effects on actual food selection in a simulated caf&amp;eacute; environment will then be assessed. It is predicted that healthier food selection will be promoted.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The results will provide evidence to help develop a new intervention to promote healthier eating.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project will benefit academic researchers particularly those in the area of health and social psychology. Groups in the UK and in the USA and elsewhere conduct research on this and related-topics, so they are likely to benefit from this research. The research will also contribute to the development and wider adoption of novel methods based on social norm approaches to increase healthy behaviours. The research will contribute to the training of a skilled researcher with wide knowledge and expertise in both experimental studies and interventions. The results will also be of interest to health professionals and policy makers as well as the general public. Economic and societal impacts include improvements in health and well-being. Given the health costs associated with unhealthy eating patterns it is important to explore new avenues for improving the Nation's diet. Wide dissemination of the results (see pathways to impact plan) will ensure that a range of stakeholders are reached and beneficiaries of this project are not be limited to those in the UK.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>260167</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Starbucks</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Pilot research project</gtr:description><gtr:id>D95C2DB5-A8B2-454C-B203-3D374633292D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partners assisted with the production of materials for the study and access to stores</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We conducted some pilot research on the potential for using social norms to encourage healthier purchases</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>C H &amp; Co Ltd</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>CH&amp;amp;Co</gtr:description><gtr:id>AE24078D-D8F3-4862-90CF-D8CE9824808F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have submitted a paper for publication based on the research</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The company allowed us to use their restaurants to conduct the studies</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We conducted research studies in the restaurants that are run by the company</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Private</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Seminar at the University of Hull</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CFBE9B2D-D74D-4407-BBC8-D1D98E37B950</gtr:id><gtr:impact>There were many questions and lots of discussion after the talk

During the walk they discussed how this 'busy' foodscape might influence the own eating and, in turn, the body weight. Professor Suzanne Higgs from the University of Birmingham outlined some influences on foods choice that you might find surprising and discussed some new strategies that might help to encourage healthy eating.

We presented participants with either a neutral control message (neutral-control), a control poster which featured vegetables (control-food), a message about the health benefits of consuming vegetables (health), a description of how other students eat plenty of vegetables (descriptive norm), or a message which conveyed how much students like eating vegetables (liking norm). Participants were exposed to one of these messages, and then either given direct access to a buffet of snack foods (no delay), or given access after a delay of 24 hours (delay) to examine whether the effects of the messages were sustained over time. 

400 participants were recruited to the study, 47 were excluded hence, 353 participants successfully completed the study. Preliminary results indicate that for individuals who do not usually eat much fruit and vegetables (low habitual consumers), both the control-food, descriptive norm and the liking norm significantly enhanced the amount of vegetables eaten, compared to the control-neutral message. Further analysis of the individual vegetables consumed (cucumber, celery and broccoli) suggests that being exposed to the liking norm enhanced the consumption of broccoli when given immediate access (no delay), but showed an even greater enhancement of intake when it was provided after 24 hours (delay).

Together, these results suggest that social norms can be used to enhance the intake of vegetables, even when standard health messages fail. The control-food message also had an effect, though the reasons for this require further investigation. Examination of the individual vegetables suggest that the largest increase in broccoli consumption after the liking norm message was produced after a delay, suggesting that not only does the effect of the norm not decrease, but it might actually be stronger after a delay.

We have also conducted intervention studies in a workplace setting using similar norm based messages about how most people eat vegetables and found that this increased purchases of meals with vegetables.In a follow on study in University restaurants we also found that social norm message increased purchase of vegetable side dishes and analysis suggests that this effect may be stronger for women than for men. 

Two other lab based studies have been completed and the data are being analysed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings could be translated into healthy eating interventions to be used in the workplace or educational setting or commercial canteens.
