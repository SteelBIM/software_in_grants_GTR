Transaction spreads are generally small in the interdealer market. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, do these favourable market conditions in the interdealer market also translate into favourable trading conditions in the customer segment of the bond market, in which smaller banks and other financial institutions request quotes from the primary dealers? As with many other markets, these wholesale customers do not have access to the interdealer trading platforms. Does dealer intermediation impose considerable costs for the clients? What determines the quality of customer quotes and their dispersion? These are very important and pressing policy concerns for European security regulators.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project addresses these questions based on new data which combine interdealer price data from the largest European bond trading platform MTS with customer price data from the 'BondVision' customer quote request system, which is also owned by MTS. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>A preliminary analysis suggests that customers get a better deal than dealers and it is proposed to develop, estimate and test a new model to explain this. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>286991</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Market Order Flows, Limit Order Flows and Exchange Rate Dynamics  -  {MM}</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9070A02B-BF75-47D6-B6DC-1237E7BD0792</gtr:id><gtr:impact>My thoughts were developed

Equilibrium exchange rates depend on both types of flows. Limit orders have lower price impact than market orders because they reduce the inventory that has to be absorbed by ultimate customers. We test these predictions using data from an order-driven inter-dealer FX trading venue. Our analysis supports the predictions of the model and the empirical price impact of market order flows is substantially increased by the inclusion of limit orders as an additional variable.

Conceptual impact

This project started out with a very specific focus on the euro-denominated bond market. The task was to find a theoretical explanation from the robust but astonishing empirical finding that retail customers were getting a better price than wholesale dealers in this sophisticated financial market. This objective was comprehensively achieved but the research went much further. Retail and wholesale markets co-exist throughout the economy and not just in euro-denominated bond markets. The traditional view among economists is that two-tiered markets such as this arise from restrictive practices and like all restrictive practices are bad for society. Our theory had succeeded in saying something very different. Wholesale markets, to which retail customers have no access, serve a valuable social function. We showed that wholesale markets are very fragile and that policy can be focussed on keeping them in existence.
Early working papers from this research twice achieved top 10 status for downloads on the Economics Research part of SSRN (the Social Science Research Network.). The two occasions were on 30th October 2010 in the Outlooks and Forecasting topic and again on 29th September 2012 in the Networks topic. Altogether papers related to this project were viewed 2347 times and downloaded 255 times from SSRN.

2. Instrumental Impact

My co-author, Harald Hau formerly of INSEAD, now of the Swiss Finance Institute chaired a panel at the European Finance Association meeting in 2010. The title of the panel was &amp;quot;Transaction Taxes and Short-Selling Restrictions: Stability Tools or Dangerous Populism?&amp;quot; and he took the opportunity to highlight the practical relevance of the project to the Tobin tax question. Such panels are a mix of practitioners and academics. Among the practitioners on panel on that occasion was Carlos Tavares, Chair, Committee of European Security Regulators (CESR) 
An early version of the work was presented at a practitioner/ academic encounter in Frankfurt on the The Industrial Organisation of Securities Markets organised by Center for Financial Studies (CFS) and Deutsche B&amp;ouml;rse AG.
Later versions of the work led to expressions of interest from both the Bank of England in 2013 and the Banque de France in 2014. In July 2014, a more complete version of the final paper was presented at a practitioner/academic conference organised by the Banco Central do Brasil in S&amp;atilde;o Paulo. The title of the conference was the 9th Annual Seminar on Risk, Financial Stability and Banking.

3. Capacity Building

The post-doctoral research fellow employed through this project, Dr. Arze Karam has successfully begun an academic career in the UK. She is currently a lecturer in Economics at Durham University Business School. She also leads their MSc finance programme and specifically teaches MSc market microstructure.

4. Grant bids

Through this project, I built my capacity in the area of microstructure, specifically in relation to bonds. However this enabled me to apply for a new grant in a different area: exchange rates. I successfully applied for a grant from the Leverhulme trust entitled &amp;quot;The Finance Microstructure Approach to the Economics of Exchange Rates&amp;quot;.
Arising from the research on this project, I became part of a team that successfully bid for a grant funded by the European Commission's Marie Curie Actions Industry-Academia Partnerships and Pathways (IAPP). The project &amp;quot;The Efficiency of Futures Markets&amp;quot; is a joint cooperation program between Ghent University, Belgium, Queen's University Belfast, UK, the University of Warwick, Coventry, UK, and the alternative investment specialist RPM Risk &amp;amp; Portfolio Management AB from Stockholm, Sweden.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2010</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>5A1DB0BE-6E8D-403E-8DE5-2772BC46F728</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We discovered that in a two tiered market, retail investors can pay a lower spread to dealers than dealers charge to each other.
