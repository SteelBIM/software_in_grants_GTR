As anyone whose child has learned to escape their car seat knows, preschool children have a remarkably fast and powerful ability to learn by observing others? causal actions. Previous work suggests that humans may be unique in this regard, but what psychological mechanisms, if any, differ among primates?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We will first use a computational model to predict how learners should learn from different demonstrations. We will then conduct a study examining what learners of different species actually do. In this study, children, chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys will observe a human demonstrator perform two actions (eg pulling a lever and turning a dial) on a puzzle box. Only the second action causes reward production, but the first action is more plausibly necessary if the actor performs it on purpose, or in mechanical contact with the reward. The question is whether these variables affect the tendency of different species to perform the 'unnecessary' action in the sequence.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;This research will help us to understand the ways in which human cognition differs from that of other primates, and when these evolutionary changes might have occurred.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Public engagement with science
The evolutionary origin of cognition is an exciting area of scientific inquiry, and one that has broad public interest. Members of the public will benefit from this research by being able to observe and learn about the research while it is in progress at venues such as the Edinburgh zoo and local libraries and science museums. Scientific research is generally conducted in laboratories and is relatively invisible to the public. Allowing members of the public to observe and participate in research will raise awareness of and interest in cognitive science research and scientific inquiry in general. We particularly expect this work to benefit preschool and school age children, by allowing them to both observe and actively participate in science. 

Increased understanding of children's learning abilities
In the medium and longer term, we expect that the results of the proposed experiments will improve our understanding of children's cognitive abilities and in particular, will have broad implications for how pedagogy and expertise can influence children's learning. Previous research by the PI and others has already generated interesting implications for teaching, suggesting that direct instruction can enhance but also has the potential to interfere with learning. The proposed research will therefore provide important insights into how children learn from teachers, both formally in the classroom and informally in the world.
 
Benefits to teachers, schools and educational policy makers
Even in domains such as causal learning, where explicit instruction is not needed for learning to take place, children are influenced by the information they receive from others. This research will inform our understanding of the impact instructors' words and demonstrations can have on children, and we expect that in the longer term our results will contribute to advances in education policy, especially approaches to early instruction in preschool and grade school settings, and changes in teacher training and education. 

Benefits to parents and families
The proposed work looks at the role of what is called &amp;quot;natural pedagogy&amp;quot; in children's learning. Natural pedagogy is the informal teaching stance that most adults intuitively take when interacting with young children. This instinctive teaching approach is used not only by teachers in the classroom, but also by parents and other caregivers in their day to day lives. Therefore, results from this research may benefit caregivers and the children they care for, by helping us to understand the best ways for them to encourage children's natural learning abilities. 

Benefits to zoo animals and primates in captivity
The proposed experiments with primates at the Edinburgh Zoo involve challenging social and physical reasoning problems. Participating in these experiments provides primates with species appropriate stimulation and cognitive enrichment. In the longer term, we expect that the research proposed here will increase our understanding of non-human primate cognition and social behavior, allowing for the design of improved, species appropriate enrichment activities, social interactions and housing structures in zoos and other situations where primates are kept in captivity. Boredom, social isolation and high stress levels are serious health and welfare problems for captive animals, especially social and intelligent animals such as primates. Results of this research will help zoos and animal caretakers to avoid or mitigate these issues.

Benefits to primate conservation and policy
We expect the results of this research to contribute to the understanding of primate cognition and primate social behavior. The primates involved in this research belong to species that are threatened or endangered. Developing appropriate and effective animal management, conservation and breeding programs, requires understanding species-typical behavior to be successful.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-06</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>242111</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Rainbow Nursery, St Andrews</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Rainbow Nursery</gtr:description><gtr:id>AFECCC24-C974-428E-BD76-16D7D74022F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based on the success of us running our study at the nursery, other researchers from the University of St Andrews have now set up a collaboration with the nursery and will continue to run studies there.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The nursery assisted us in recruiting participants for our study and provided an area for us to run the study in.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We ran a study with 3- to 5-year old children at this nursery.

Because our study essentially involved playing with a toy to win stickers, parents and children were able to see how fun and engaging the process of science can be.

Following their child's participation, several parents asked if they could invite their friends to participate in our research, which meant we were able to increase our sample size as well as engaging more members of the public in science.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Meet the Researchers at Living Links</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A872F94E-3EB1-4628-A7DE-65ECCADD33CC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ECT explained to zoo visitors the types of the questions we are trying to answer when conducting research with primates, as well as highlighting the important fact that the primates' participation in our studies is voluntary and they are free to leave the research cubicles whenever they like.

After talking with members of the public, several of them remarked that they had a better understanding of the sort of research that goes on at the zoo and that they found it very interesting. This was reflected in the insightful questions they asked following our discussions.
