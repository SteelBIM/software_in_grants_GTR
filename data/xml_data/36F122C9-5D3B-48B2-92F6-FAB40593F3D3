Millions of workers are added to the global workforce and it is cheap labour, which makes the PRC so attractive for foreign direct investment (FDI). Unsurprisingly, it is workers who are most under pressure as a result. Chinese workers often work in conditions of super-exploitation, while workers elsewhere either become unemployed, because production is moved to the PRC, or they are pressured into accepting lower wages and worse working conditions through the threat of production transfer to China.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims at analysing the role of Chinese labour within these structural changes at the production, national and international level. It will be investigated to what extent trade unions and NGOs have been able to protect the interests of Chinese workers within China and through cooperation with international labour organisations.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Methodologically, this project will draw on existing data such as FDI flows and GDP levels, semi-structured interviews with workers and managers, representatives of the official Chinese trade union, informal labour organisations, the Chinese government, the International Trade Union Confederation and the International Labour Organization. Official documents of these organisations will also be consulted.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>274998</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation at the International Studies Association Forum in Wien/Austria, July 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7B413C7-7544-4797-96AF-B1C55233CDC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Yan HUANG and Chun-Yi Lee (2016) 'Who to Decide 'Good Job' or 'Bad Job'? a Bargaining Game of Production: Case Study from Pearl River Delta', paper distributed at the 3rd International Sociological Association (ISA) Forum of Sociology; Vienna/Austria, 10-14 July 2016.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://isaconf.confex.com/isaconf/forum2016/webprogram/Cluster198.html</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Andreas Bieler and Chun-Yi Lee (2014) 'Exploitation and Resistance: a comparative analysis of the Chinese cheap labour electronics and high - value added IT sectors'.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>19C60DD7-B6DC-4D5E-8B33-67D91CA024C2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at the international workshop 'Chinese Labour in the Global Economy, held at Nottingham University, 11 and 12 September 2014.

First, Chun-Yi Lee was a key member of the organisation team of the Asian Labour Activist-Academics Dialogue, Yokohama, Japan, 13 July 2014, in which findings from the research project were discussed with activists and labour academics from other Asian countries including China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan. 

Second, key findings were presented at our international workshop in September 2014. See https://chineselabour.wordpress.com/international-workshop/

This workshop was attended by representatives of Chinese informal labour NGOs as well as a representative of the International Transport Workers' Federation and a representative of the British NGO War on Want. As a result of their meeting at the international workshop, they organised an additional meeting at War on Want in London, where they discussed further co-operation with the goal of strengthening the position of Chinese workers in negotiations with employers and Chinese local government authorities.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3E07C0C6-2894-4742-A8C1-05C8AE244035</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The key findings of the project can be summarised as follows:

1. China continues to be integrated into the global political economy mainly as an assembly platform for exports. Pre-fabricated parts are imported, assembled in Chinese factories and then exported to North America and Europe. Hence, China's economic growth still depends on its enormous resource of cheap labour. Some attempts are made to expand into areas of more high-valued added production, but this is still very much at the beginning. 

2. Considering this dependence on cheap labour, conclusions about Chinese developmental catch-up and China emerging as the new economic hegemon at the world level are premature. Instead, Chinese development is characterised by uneven and combined development. It is combined in that it is closely related to development in the core with the predominant part of assembly production being controlled by large foreign transnational corporations, either directly or indirectly. And it is uneven in that the gap between China and industrialised countries remains large and the gap between the poor and the rich, the inland areas and the coastal regions in China itself is increasing. 

3. Unsurprisingly, working conditions in factories are highly exploitative, characterised by low wages, long working-hours and a lack of health and safety measures.

4. There is a close connection between the type of production, the related workers' salaries and working conditions and corresponding industrial relations. While cheap labour assembly production is based on low wages, exploitative working conditions, a high turn-over of the workforce as well as conflictual industrial relations with high strike rates, the salaries and working conditions in the more-high value added production units especially in the area of the Yangtze River Delta are significantly better. Because production relies on more highly qualified workers and depends on continuity in employment relations, workers are treated better. Moreover, informal labour NGOs are integrated into industrial relations by employers and local government in an effort to improve the overall working environment in the factory as well as wider society. 

5. The main objective of informal labour NGOs is the right to form free trade unions and to engage in collective bargaining with employers. They do not want to return to a communist past. Although grass-root labour organisations are still under great pressure from the government, this research uncovered the strong organisational activities by grass-root labour NGOs to enhance workers' collective bargaining power and to strengthen workers' understanding of industrial relations based on negotiations between employers and trade unions.

6. Unsurprisingly, Chinese workers' strikes are not only driven by economic interests. They are increasingly demanding more general workers' rights such as the right to form free trade unions outside the government controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU); 

7. It is noticeable that the younger generation of Chinese workers is more assertive and proactive than the older one. Born after the 1980s, this younger generation now forms the core of the Chinese workforce. It is better connected through the new means of social media and more confident at demanding a decent working environment. 

8. Although China has not joined the ILO, a network of regional workers/labour scholars has gradually been established. They have increasingly interacted across different countries including, for example, South Korea, Japan, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Several informal workshops of this network have been part of this research project. 


Overall, the role of Chinese workers within the Chinese form of state as well as the global political economy is still in the making. The outcome of these struggles is not only relevant for China, but also the wider world.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Chinese informal labour NGOs will find these results interesting for devising their strategies.
