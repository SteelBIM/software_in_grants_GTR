plant utilisation of soil organic phosphorus</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>BB/K018167/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable resource, essential for crop production. Uncertainties over mineral P supplies coupled with concerns for food security and environmental impact of P on waters all necessitate an improvement in agronomic P efficiencies, based on sound knowledge of the range of P forms in soils. Our research is different to previous approaches to recover P from soils in that it focuses on the organic P (Po) components and uses a novel combination of root exudates from different plants to solubilise organic P and make it bioavailable as inorganic orthophosphate.

The two fundamental problems associated with the use of soil organic P by plants are that much of it is strongly attached to soil particles and therefore inaccessible to plants, and secondly, even when not firmly attached to soil particles, the forms in which it exists are not readily available for plant uptake. Some plants possess traits that can help access organic P in soils; firstly some plants can produce organic acids from their roots, which can release the P attached to soil particles, and secondly some can release phosphatases (e.g. phytase), which can hydrolyse the organic P into forms which plants can take-up. However, crop plants generally do not possess both these traits and so combinations of plants are required, each carrying out a different role. Systems that rely on clover undersown into cereal crops to provide nitrogen (N) to the current crop, act as an overwinter green manure, and to provide N to following crops are fairly common in organic farming enterprises. We have clover lines which can produce phytase required to mineralize organic P, while some strains of barley have been shown to release organic acids, making the organic P available for mineralisation. We will investigate a clover/barley bi-cropping system as an exemplar sustainable alternative to intensive applications of P and N fertilizers, thus potentially making the arable system more efficient both economically and environmentally. Thus we shall test the overarching hypothesis that: Cropping systems with roots exuding both organic acid anions and phytase can facilitate more sustainable agricultural production by accessing soil organic P forms. 

Specifically, we propose to investigate and understand the role of organic acids and phosphatases in plant mixtures in accessing the organic P from the inositol phosphate pool. We shall then explore what happens to these organic P forms in the soils and the rhizosphere and examine their potential (or otherwise) for leaching from the soil to surface waters where they may cause eutrophication. A range of experiments will be carried out to identify potentially suitable strains of barley and clover for such a system, followed by experiments incorporating different combinations of these strains, grown in soil, to assess what combinations can most efficiently access different forms of organic P, while minimizing leaching losses. By increasing the amount of P utilized from the P stored in soils we can reduce the reliance on inorganic fertilisers, increasing agricultural sustainability and improving our ability to deliver food security in coming decades.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Organic phosphorus is a common constituent of the P in many soils and comprises mostly of esters of fully oxidised P where P is attached to C through an O atom. Other compounds such as phosphonates and organic polyphosphates occur in lesser amounts. Our appreciation of the extent to which crop plants can utilise organic P pools in soils is limited. The overarching aim of the project is to test the hypothesis that: Cropping systems with roots exuding both organic acid anions and phytase can facilitate more sustainable agricultural production by accessing soil organic P forms. 

We will investigate and attempt to understand the role of organic acid anions and phosphatases in exemplar plant mixtures in accessing organic P in soils. We shall then explore what happens to these compounds in the soils and the rhizosphere. A range of experiments will be carried out to identify potentially suitable strains of barley and clover for such a system, followed by experiments incorporating different combinations of these strains, grown in soil, to assess what combinations can most efficiently access different forms of organic P, while minimizing the losses of P via leachate. Experiments and techniques employed will include screening of plant populations for abilities to exude organic acids and phosphatases using anion exchange resins (AERs) and DGT (diffusive gradients in thin films), HPLC, enzyme hydrolysis and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, for identification of organic P compounds and groups in soil extracts and soil water.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable resource crucial to past and future agricultural productivity. The primary source of P fertiliser is mineral deposits, with 85% of the global resource being located in Morocco and Western Sahara. This concentrated geographical distribution means that global food security is threatened not only by finite supplies of rock phosphate fertiliser, but also through potential geopolitical instability. Therefore growing concerns for food security necessitate an improvement in agronomic P efficiencies, based on sound knowledge of the range and quantities of P forms in soils. This proposed project will explore technologies to improve crop productivity and nutrient use efficiency by enhancing the availability to plants of organic P in soils (which is relatively unavailable, but plentiful), whilst also minimising any potential negative environmental consequences. It therefore potentially has implications for anyone involved in crop production from agricultural research scientists, fertiliser suppliers, crop breeders, land managers through to policy makers. Knowledge of organic P species in soils is fundamental to the development of new plant varieties able to hydrolyse the organic P resources which may occur in different soil types and therefore this project is of particular interest to plant breeders. Additionally, it will assist with development of cropping techniques such as bi-cropping for maximisation of the benefits of different plant traits. A plant combining approach that increases P acquisition may be readily adopted into grassland and fodder agriculture and subsequently ways found to allow extension to intensive arable systems. This could be realised by the use of plant molecular genetics to allow both exudation of low molecular weight organic acid anions and enzymes in cereal crop varieties. It would become viable to explore these different agronomic application options once the grounding work on organic P release from the soil-plant system, as contained in this proposal, is completed. 

Ultimately this work could potentially inform policy through providing information on how to maximise crop yields while minimising fertiliser inputs. Results could influence the way in which cropping systems are considered in the future, providing some fundamental science supporting their development, based on more than just yield/productivity, but also on the specific soil/plant processes involved. In the long term this work could contribute to the nation's wealth by providing guidance on more nutrient efficient cropping techniques and indicating which traits in plants should be developed, and how they may work in tandem to maximise productivity while minimising fertiliser usage. It may also mean that the nation becomes less reliant on the increasingly scarce global mineral P resources, which are not only becoming more expensive, but also in a time of political instability, could potentially become inaccessible. The basic principle behind the science proposed here is relatively simple to convey, and in combination with its strategic importance to BBSRC with regard to Food Security, makes it an ideal topic to showcase to the public. This will be done at all the participating Institutes' Open days/School Science Week events, meaning it would not only have benefits to the current scientific community, but may also stimulate a new generation of scientists into this field of research. This project addresses the BBSRC strategic research priority areas of crop science (food security) and global security. The project team have direct access to avenues for dissemination of the science into policy through the EA/DEFRA Demonstration Test Catchments, the SEPA Diffuse Pollution Management Advisory Group and the JHI Centres of Expertise for Waters.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-01-26</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-27</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>434085</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Guelph</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Canada</gtr:country><gtr:description>Abundance of bacterial phosphatase genes in rhizosphere soils of citrate and phytase exuding tobacco plants</gtr:description><gtr:id>132C6112-162E-4B2C-B3DC-B79B69E71AC5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work was presented in poster format at a workshop on organic phosphorus research in the Lake District UK in September 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>KD conducted the analysis of phosphatase gene abundance in the soil DNA samples collected at the James Hutton Institute</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Through a collaboration with Kari Dunfield (University of Guelph, Canada), the abundance of bacterial acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, and beta-propellor phytase genes was determined in rhizosphere soils, which were collected from transgenic tobacco plant lines with constitutive expression of citrate efflux (Cit: A. thaliana frd3) and heterologous fungal phytase exudation (Phy: Aspergillus niger phyA, Peniophora lycii phyA) traits.

Optimising the efficiency of crop nutrient supply and reducing dependence on expensive inorganic fertilizers are key goals towards developing a more sustainable agriculture that will benefit poorer communities. The workshop will explore the potential for agro-engineering of the soil rhizosphere to meet these goals through adaptations of soil-crop-microbial interactions. The purpose of the workshop is to develop a co-operative research framework for Brazil and UK young scientists to come together to forge new understanding and capacity building in rhizosphere science to support sustainable and profitable food production, product innovation and poverty alleviation.

This was the first demonstration of the game and based on its success future outreach events were scheduled.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Highlights of Research presented to BBRO (British Beet Research Organisation)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>04C6B791-FBEF-42B8-BF59-1C1CA7767EA5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presented research highlights including those from the OPUS project</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Joint Workshop between James Hutton Instiute, CEH and CAAS Beijing</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2C2D71FA-C4A4-4F73-AC89-08BA6645F80C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop was designed to foster collaborative research between researchers at the three institutes</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Several stands were hosted at LEAF (Linking Environment and Farming) Technical Day, Balruddery nr Dundee, Jul 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A7282A25-5946-4E0B-8675-0ECA62B100F2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Two stands were hosted on a round the farm tour to look at innovations in the field, these comprised an exhibit on P efficiency by linking edge of field (buffer zones) and in field practices and the other on crop P acquisition.

A range of experiments were conducted to identify cultivars of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and legume species with complementary root exudation and morphological characteristics for intercropping. Through facilitation and improved cycling of P in soils, the intercropped barley and legume lines are expected to facilitate sustainable agricultural production through improved P use efficiency, possible by acquiring soil organic P. 

An intercropping experiment was designed based on the results of an initial barley and legume screening study, which recommended that barley cultivars and legume species with the most disparate exudate and morphological root characteristics would experience fewer competitive interactions and may therefore facilitate the acquisition of P from soils. The intercropping study with barley and legumes showed that complementarity occurred in some but not all plant combinations and depended on soil P availability, whereby complementarity was greatest at the sub-critical P requirement for barley. 

Using model tobacco plant lines with heterologous expression of fungal phytases (Phy) and Arabidopsis citrate transporters (Cit), the beneficial interaction of citrate and phytase exudation was demonstrated in a soil with limited P availability (Podzol). Positive growth effects between intercropped (Int) citrate- and phytase-exuding plant lines coincided with the depletion of organic P in rhizosphere soils when the roots of two plants were intermingled. 

An experiment was designed to investigate the importance of root intermingling in the development of complementarity between the citrate- and phytase-exuding tobacco plant lines. As observed in the first study with tobacco, positive complementarity occurred in the P limited soil when Cit and Phy plant roots intermingled. However, when plant roots were separated by a permeable mesh barrier, complementarity diminished. Whether complementarity occurred in separated root treatments depended on the source and relative mobility of the phytase being expressed. The Peniophora lycii phyA is expected to be relatively more mobile in soil (pH 5) compared to the Aspergillus niger phyA based on differences in isoelectric point. Only in Cit+Phy plant combinations containing the more mobile phytase was positive complementarity observed in separated root treatments. This study also showed that complementarity between Cit and Phy plants only occurs under conditions of limited soil P availability and scales with the rate of citrate efflux in Cit plants. Importantly, gains in shoot P content due to the interaction of these exudates in a P limited soil (+0.1-0.2% shoot P) would be adequate for many crop species to transition from physiological deficient to sufficient in P.

The interaction of citrate and phytase exudates was expected to promote the depletion of organic P forms in the rhizosphere. Specifically, tobacco plants expressing the Phy exudation trait were expected to promote the depletion of soil phytate beyond that of wild-type or vector control plant lines. Analysis of rhizosphere soils with solution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that the Phy trait did not lead to a greater depletion of soil organic P (in comparison to null vector and wild-type plants) when plants were grown in a soil with adequate P in plant available P (Cambisol). Pleiotropic effects of the vector plant line, including a larger root biomass, and differences in soil pH among plant treatments were likely factors effected this outcome. However, in a limited available P soil, 31P NMR analysis revealed a greater depletion of soil organic P (albeit not phytate specifically) and increase in plant available orthophosphate in soils planted with Cit and Phy tobacco combinations. The intercropped plant combinations also accumulated more shoot P than the other plant treatments, suggesting that organic P converted to orthophosphate in soil was utilised for growth by these plants. 

Collectively, the experiments conducted with tobacco indicate that the interaction of citrate and phytase exudates promotes the conversion of soil organic P for plant P uptake, but only when soil available P is limited. The development of complementarity in barley-legume intercropping systems also only occurred with limited soil P availability. The development of positive complementarity and gains in shoot P content could be sufficient to improve plant P nutrition in cropping systems but will depend on exudate characteristics (rate of efflux, enzyme mobility) and distribution of exudates in soil. Furthermore, organic anion and phosphatase exudate-based strategies for improving the acquisition of soil P by plants appear to be the most effective in limited available P soils, which are also abundant in organic P.

Using the DGT method applied in soils, studies of P bioavailability, mobility and resupply from solid phase were performed in 32 UK soils and a set of controlled experiments using 2 UK soils were conducted to investigate the effect of various organic anions on solid-to-solution phase partitioning of phosphorus. This allowed a better comprehension of the phosphorus chemistry with deep insights on its agronomic use across a wide range of different UK soils and plant exudation conditions.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Findings will be published in scientific journals and presented at national and international conferences</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>4517BDC9-15D8-485B-BD35-B919F99ED656</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Education,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://soilorganicp.com/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>EU consultation on P Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AD2B339E-CBAD-4D41-8CE9-2EBE1AEAD2CA</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ec.europa.eu/environment/consultations/pdf/phosphorus/EN.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A method has been developed using TXRF methods to test the purity of silver phosphate in relation to oxygen isotope studies as part of the 18O tracing on the phosphate molecule.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D8BB8D30-04D2-4298-AA45-F2BAE780EDEC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In development but allows better process control in the analysis of 18O in the phosphate molecule for tracing</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>XRF method to confirm purity of silver phosphate</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Developed new image analysis techniques and calibration protocols for quantifying phosphatase activity in soils and around roots using 2D fluorescent substrate-based zymography. The method for soil zymogrphy was originally developed by Spohn and Kuzyakov (2013, Soil Biol Biochem). A nylon filter impregnated with 4-methylumbelliferylphosphate (MUP) is pressed against the surface of soil and roots (following growth in rhizobox) and hydrolysis of MUP leads to production of the fluorescent product (4-methylumbelliferone, 4-MU). When first using the method, we found the calibration, which uses 4-MU, to be sensitive to exposure time, which in subsequent tests significantly affected the calculation of phosphatase activity around roots. Additionally, an advanced image analysis tool was developed to extract grayvalue data from 2D images and quantify the intensity of phosphatase activity along root longitudinal and perpendicular axes. Collectively, the improved calibration and image analysis tools will advance the potential for soil zymography to provide quantitative data for plant and soil scientists.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3D13EBD8-4272-48F0-BE6B-D0F19F1C9CB4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The new calibration protocol, relating 4-methylumbelliferone to phosphatase activity, was developed in collaboration with University of Lincoln (L Condron) and PhD student (G.
