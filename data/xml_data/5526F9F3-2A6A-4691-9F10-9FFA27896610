engineering applications become more sophisticated, the need for autonomous systems that can act intelligently without direct human intervention increases. Yet the autonomous control at the heart of many such systems is often ad-hoc and opaque. Since the cost of failure in critical systems is high, a more reliable, understandable and consistent approach is needed. Thus, in this project we aim to provide a rational agent architecture that controls autonomous decision-making, is re-usable and generic, and can be configured for many different autonomous platforms. In partnership with the industrial collaborators we aim to show how such &amp;quot;reconfigurable autonomy&amp;quot; can be achieved in relevant applications.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-29</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>405962</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Nuclear Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Machine vision system for nuclear waste</gtr:description><gtr:id>C8EB2B91-431B-4594-AC15-D1CFA5002186</gtr:id><gtr:impact>-Visual Classification of Waste Material for Nuclear Decommissioning, journal publication in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

One challenging problem currently faced by the nuclear industry is the segregation of redundant waste material into a choice of 'post-processes' based upon the nature and extent of its radioactivity that may pose a serious threat to the environment. Following an initial inspection, waste materials are subjected to treatment, disruption and consigned to various types of export containers. To date, the process of objects (waste) classification is performed manually. In order to automate this process, robotic platforms can be deployed that utilise robust and fast vision systems for visual classification of nuclear waste material. We proposed a novel solution incorporating a machine vision system for autonomous identification of waste material from decommissioned nuclear plants. Using nuclear waste simulants, off-line exhaustive 'proof-of-concept' quantitative assessment of the proposed technique was performed using experimental datasets. The system was also implemented in-situ in real time with plans for future improvement using additional extereoceptive sensors for higher fidelity in terms of detection and recognition.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Nuclear Laboratory</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>3D Autonomous nuclear waste management</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA6B0741-A0DA-4D98-844C-9B20A589C243</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Full end-to-end lab-based demo at University of Sheffield for industrial partners.

The process involves demolition of physical infrastructure which results in large quantity of residual waste material. The resulting waste materials are packed into import containers to be delivered for post-processing either as sealed canisters or an unpackaged assortment of miscellaneous objects. At present this does not happen within the United Kingdom, but Sellafield Ltd. and National Nuclear Laboratory are developing a process for future operation so that upon an initial inspection, imported waste materials undergo two different stages of post-processing before being packed into export containers, namely sort and segregate or sort and disrupt. The sort and segregate facility will remotely sort the waste on a sorting table and place items in an appropriate
container, depending upon waste type and condition for downstream processing. If any of the waste is in sealed containers, it will require disruption, before being placed in the appropriate waste container, which is known as sort and disrupt. The process is to be performed through tele-operation. This work focuses on the design, development, and demonstration of a reconfigurable rational agent-based robotic system that can
potentially automate these processes. The proposed system will be demonstrated using a downsize, lab-based setup incorporating a small-scale robotic arm, a single time of flight camera, and high-level rational agent-based decision making and control framework.

1) Used state-of-the art object detection and tracking paradigms that have not received substantial attention in spacecraft navigation applications in the past. More importantly we focused on computer vision techniques that can be as generic as possible (in contrary to engineered models) and can efficiently be integrated into an in-situ reconfigurable architecture. This work specifically focused on saliency based visual modelling techniques that can effectively detect object (e.g., rocks) on a planetary surface. In order to help us develop a sound foundation for visual saliency modelling techniques specifically focused towards autonomous spacecraft navigation (on homogenous planetary surfaces) we started off by carrying out extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis of some of the latest visual saliency models already well known across the computer vision research community. These evaluations were performed on simulated, lab-based and real world recorded datasets that quite closely replicate remote planetary environments. 

This work resulted in the following research findings:

- The use of unsupervised (bottom-up) visual saliency models can indeed prove to be useful in planetary exploration rovers (this may as well be extended to satellite imagery).

- With a remarkable level of distinction among different saliency modelling techniques in terms of their performance measures we are able to differentiate, recognise and understand the crucial sensory excitation parameters that can work better on a homogenous planetary environment.

- This ultimately lead towards a saliency model that is effectively tuned for (the more challenging) homogenous planetary environments

2) Developed a machine vision system for use in nuclear decommissioning process, more importantly for automated classification of nuclear waste material.

- System has real-time processing capabilities
- Has proven to be robust in visual object detection and recognition

3) Developed a lab-based machine vision system potentially for use in nuclear decommissioning process, more specifically for the sort and disrupt problem in Box Encapsulation Plants within the National Nuclear Laboratory:
- The system uses a TOF camera for recording 3D point clouds of the visual scene
- A 3D visual object detection algorithm processes the point clouds to recognise cylinders, estimating pose and geometric properties
- System has been tested in laboratory with a scaled down setup of the BEP at NNL</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The current research work is specifically focused towards more generic machine vision and learning algorithms (being adaptive and robust to novel operating environments) that can potentially lead to a wide variety of applications (but not limited to):

- SAR missions

- International maritime services

- Defence: aerial/ground surveillance

- Medical (such as robotic key-hole surgeries)

- Industrial manufacturing and automation

- Automated nuclear waste disposal and management

- Robotic agricultural plants The current work progress will help us to explore novel dimensions in space robotics in future; for instance autonomous systems that are used for planetary exploration missions can be considered as distributed, cognitive systems (having adaptive, anticipatory and goal directed behaviour) rather than isolated engineered system. Such systems would of course require the use of novel (previously unexplored) unconventional methods in space, such as (but are not limited to): computational intelligence, cognitive vision, cognitive machine learning techniques.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7D88D180-3FB1-4F2C-BA57-806D520F345C</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Electronics,Energy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Retail,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.surrey.ac.uk/ssc/research/star-lab/enabling_technologies/index.htm/index.htm</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>The dataset was generated using Planet and Asteroid Natural scene Generation Utility (PANGU), (developed at the University of Dundee) and image capture software from the PM-SLAM.

UK. Images recorded using the perspective projections of each simulant were distinctly placed on a sorting table for multiple values of ? and f. In order to maximise the disparity in object orientation within the training/test sample space, a secondary subsampled dataset is generated from the original set of projections by rotating each image over the angular domain of ?. Each rotated image is further scaled by reducing or increasing by {1.1, ..., 1.5} &amp;times; original image, which creates a stack of successively smaller and larger images to simulate size variations. Together, they constitute a superset of 86400 subsampled images of training and test data with ground truth annotations from which, in principle, maximally discriminative mappings of 2-D shape projections to distinct class labels can be derived. This dataset further provides the ability to train and test the system in terms of varying object positions and orientations on the sorting table. Collection of data comprising objects at different positions, orientations and locations on the sorting table helps in training and testing the algorithm with anomalies that may arise due to changes in the perspective camera projections of the objects and the resulting effects in their binary silhouettes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>02F7D469-5534-487A-BA8F-002C6327268D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Journal article: Affan Shaukat, Yang Gao, Jeffrey A.
