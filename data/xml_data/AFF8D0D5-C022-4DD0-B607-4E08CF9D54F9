&lt;p>Theorists suggested that both evolutionary and ontogenetically, young infants' social sensitivity had to be innate. We do not have much evidence for this claim, however even today. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pilot research (Nagy, 2008) showed evidence that newborn infants adjust their behaviours according to the responsiveness of their interaction partner, thus sensitively detect and react to communication disturbances. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>The main aim of the research project is to investigate and understand the way newborn infants are able to communicate and respond to their social environment right after birth. The project plans to use the still face paradigm - a laboratory paradigm to mimic communication disturbance and several modified versions of the paradigm. &lt;/p>

&lt;p>Beyond observing behaviour, by using psycho physiological methods the project plans to explore how newborns' social responses are regulated. The results could help us to present the much needed data on neonates' innate motivation to engage in interactions with others and to explore how this motivation may serve to further the ability of adaptive contextual self-regulation as early as in the very first relationships.&lt;br />&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2010-11-22</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-03-23</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>85098</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talks to parents - ongoing</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>61E3C71F-789B-49B0-8EB8-A8343962DEE2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Parents attended at information sessions on the research.

Such empirical results have an impact on 
a) Psychotherapies - the results transform the role and responsibilities of the parent, both healthy and with mental health problems; 
b) Intervention methods - contributed to the empirical and theoretical concepts behind Video Interaction Guidance (VIG, Kennedy et al., 2011) that is a nationally and internationally widely used method for intervention 
c) Transform our views on parenting. The 'exclusive role' of the parent on the developmental outcome of their young infants is now being shifted towards a sensitively co-regulated dyad. Parents and professionals learn that the newborn infant sensitively monitors and adaptively utilizes parental caretaking according to her needs. Maternal mental health is being put into a new light as we learn the aspects of maternal behaviours and sensitivity that the newborn infant is seeking out. 

These studies, using the still face paradigm and its modifications, demonstrated that human neonates sensitively perceive and adjust their behaviour according to the social responsiveness of their interaction partner. When the interaction partner became unresponsive, newborns also changed their behaviour, decreased eye contact, and displayed signs of distress. Even after the interaction partner resumed responsiveness, the effects of the communication disturbance persisted, in the form of prolonged behavioural stress and crying, and also on psychophysiological level, indexed by elevated heart rate. 
The results showed that all types of communication disturbance caused such prolonged distress and the results were not due to situational factors or chance. 
Whether this social responsivity in the newborn infant is affected by their previous interpersonal experience was explored in Study 2. The results showed that babies found the interpersonal violation stressful each time it was administered, thus they did not 'learn' to ignore it. What they 'learnt' with experience was to speed up their recovery, to notice the available caregiver sooner, and 'let them help' in the restoration. 
Psychotherapists and psychoanalysts found the results of the ability of the neonate particularly important after the PI gave an invited talk. The outputs have been cited in the textbook of Video Interactive Guidance (Kennedy, Landor, &amp;amp; Todd, 2011). 
The PI has been involved in disseminating the results to user groups. She has been invited to talk to a large group of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists at the Joint Meeting of the Brazilian and French Psychoanalytic Societies; she gave a key-note talk at the International Video Interaction Guidance Conference that brought together researchers and practitioners across a wide range of fields. 
Also, she talked about the research and the results to nurses, midwifes, obstetricians and neonatologists at the site of research, as well as to over 330 parents of newborn infants while working on the research project. 
Additionally, colleagues with a focus on disseminating research on early years have been talking about the PI's results from the project. Such mutual dissemination of research data by colleagues in the field is common and serves the benefit of all parties involved. For example, Dr. Suzanne Zeedyk talked about the PI's research to approximately 3000 people across the UK and Europe. She talked to groups of parents, childminders, teachers, mental health professionals, midwives, and addressed policy makers at the Scottish Parliament on the importance of early years, and cited empirical data from the research project. 
The following user groups benefit from the research and related expertise: medical professionals, paediatricians, obstetricians, neonatologists, general practitioners, psychiatrists; mental health and infant mental health professionals; psychotherapists working in early prevention and intervention; early-years educators; midwives, social workers and professionals working with perinatal mothers and babies, and most importantly parents and families of newborns. 
The notion of the social newborn and the ability of neonates to engage in social interactions with their parents will need to be communicated to all user groups, and will lead to short- and long-term changes in attitudes and services. Hopefully, the importance of the neonatal period in life will soon be acknowledged by mental health and social service programmes, and prevention efforts will start as early as the birth of a child.

Given the scarce knowledge on the behaviour of the newborn infant, the expected outcome for Study 2 has intentionally been left open-ended in the original proposal. While either habituation or the stability of the responses to the procedure were possible outcomes, the emerging pattern was much richer than expected. The data not only showed that babies experienced the still face manipulation very stressful even after the second administration, and with a comparable spill-over effect of distress and crying well beyond the still face phase was over and the experimenter resumed communication, but an important evidence for the impact of their earlier social experience was revealed. Babies, by the second administration, recovered their eye-contact earlier, and despite being distressed and crying, they looked at the experimenter as soon as she stopped posing the still face. It is plausible to assume that such a change in their behaviour reflects an efficient self-other regulatory process that could be described as increasing resilience with experience, while utilizing the bests of the caretaking environment. This result is expected to make the most significant impact on a wide range of fields as described above. 
The results are expected to have broader, long-term societal impacts in the area of infant and maternal mental health. 
Finally, an important part of the impact is expected to be intergenerational. It is known from both human and animal studies that attachment patterns in the infants are likely to be 'repeated' over the next generations, via behavioural and epigenetic factors. Transforming only one generation with informed, sensitive parenting from the neonatal age is expected to have long-term benefit not only in the development and the mental health of the infant, child, adolescent, and adult, but the effects to extend well beyond into the next generation(s). 
The research is a basic research and basic research takes a longer time than applied research to be translated to measurable societal and economic impact. Part of the impact is expected to be longitudinal, long-term, and intergenerational. Informed, sensitive parenting of the neonate is expected to have a long-term benefit not only in the development and the mental health of the future child, adolescent, and adult, but the effects to extend well beyond into the next generations.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2009</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8071BBA4-9818-4709-B640-335E4B09F571</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Summary: 
An unique database was collected and coded within this 20 months long project. The results led to a new field in psychology, both methodologically and conceptually. The research project enabled the PI to facilitate the emergence of 'neonatal psychology' with a sound empirical foundation. New models supported by the wealth of these data will transform our understanding of the neonate and the neonatal stage of development. Such a transformed view of the newborn will lead to a change in the way perinatal period is treated. 
The results highlight an unexpected and efficient adaptive response that enables newborn babies to notice and utilize the availability of a responsive caretaker and to facilitate their own psychophysiological recovery. Psychotherapists found these results particularly important that would challenge and overturn the widely held traditional view of a 'helpless', dependent infant who is the outcome of the caretaking process and the mother. Instead, the results call for a view of the socially competent and resilient newborn within a dynamic interactive process, where the neonate, based on her previous experiences, actively initiates increasingly efficient self-other regulatory processes. 

In detail: 
Seven studies, involving 322 newborn infants measured their reactions to communication disturbances. Given that the field is under-researched and the continuing debate over neonatal intentionality, the collected data are unique, and represent probably the largest neonatal behavioural database to date. 
The results showed that all types of communication disturbance caused prolonged distress to the newborn infants and the outcome results cannot be attributable to situational, chance factors. 
Whether human neonates' social responsivity can be affected by their previous interpersonal experience was also examined. The results showed that what babies 'learnt' with experience was not to ignore the communication violations but to regulate their own recovery by involving the available interaction partner into the repair process. 
The importance of the period following the disturbance was confirmed by physiological data. Babies subjected to the communication violation, but not controls, increased their heart rate after the still face phase, concurrently with the behavioural spill-over effects.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>a) Further empirical work on the importance of neonatal period and to describe the psychology of the neonate
