Because all proteins are made inside the bacterium the external proteins have to be moved out of the cell across the normally impermeable cell membrane by machines termed protein transporters. One type of transporter moves unfolded proteins, threading them across the membrane like string through the eye of a needle. By contrast, a second type of transporter, which we term the Tat system, moves folded proteins across the membrane. This is much more challenging than threading and so it is thought that the Tat system operates by an unusual mechanism. The Tat system is required for many bacterial processes including energy generation, cell division, nutrient acquisition, pathogenesis, and the nitrogen-fixing symbiosis of soil bacteria with plants. The Tat protein transport system is not only found in bacteria but is also present in the chloroplasts of plants where it is essential to form and maintain the proteins required to carry out photosynthesis. 
 The Tat system is a possible drug target because it is required for bacterial pathogenesis but is not found in humans or animals. It is also of biotechnological interest because it could be utilised to secrete useful protein products.
 We have recently determined the molecular structure of the core part of the Tat protein translocation apparatus. This project aims to exploit this structural data to help us understand how the Tat machinery works.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Tat system of bacteria and chloroplasts carries out the unusual, and mechanistically challenging, task of moving folded proteins across biological membranes. Substrates of the Tat transport system are responsible for a wide range of cellular processes in bacteria and are essential for plant photosynthesis. The mechanism of Tat transport remains to be elucidated. 
 The Tat system comprises the three integral proteins TatA, TatB, and TatC. TatC acts as the central organising element onto which the other two components assemble. Substrate proteins are recognized by specific signal peptides which bind to sites in TatC and TatB. 
 We have recently succeeded in determining the crystal structure of the core TatC component [Nature (2012) 492: 210-214]. This breakthrough transforms our ability to experimentally address the mechanism of Tat transport because for the first time we have a structural context to guide experimentation and interpretation. We now propose a programme of studies to exploit the TatC structure with the aim of producing a molecular-level understanding of the mechanism of Tat transport. 
 We have defined the signal peptide binding site on TatC, and the site of interaction between the TatB transmembrane helix and TatC. We will now use biochemical, biophysical, genetic, and computational methods to:
- Determine where TatA interacts with TatC.
- Determine the location of the cytoplasmic domain of TatB in the TatBC complex and gain insight into the function of this domain.
- Analyse the role of the conserved polar Glu/Gln residue exposed to the centre of the membrane bilayer in the TatC central cavity.
- Explore the conformational dynamics of TatC that may link signal peptide binding to TatA recruitment. 
- Determine the interfaces by which TatC proteins interact to form the functional substrate receptor complex.
 This experimental programme is expected to lead to fundamental advances in our understanding of the mechanism</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>This is hypothesis driven research. However, our results will be relevant in underpinning commercial efforts to exploit the Tat pathway 
 - for production of proteins of therapeutic and industrial relevance
 - as an analytical tool for quality control of protein folding
 - as a target for novel antimicrobials
 In addition the work will contribute to the development of methods to analyse the structural organisation of integral membrane protein complexes, in particular the emerging technology of membrane protein native MS being pioneered by CI Robinson. 
 Communication with potential industrial beneficiaries will take place via the technology transfer infrastructures of the University of Oxford. Specifically, we will patent intellectual property arising from this research, and then seek to license or spin-out this technology with the support of Isis Innovation Ltd in Oxford. Note that CI Robinson has experience in patent applications.
 The primary mechanism for communication of this research will be through publication in peer review international journals. Open access publishing options will be used where available. We will liaise at the time of publication with the University of Oxford and BBSRC Press offices to ensure publicity of results of interest to the general public. Our results will also be made available on our regularly updated web sites. Note also that the Tat system is now featured in mainstream cell biology text books such as Molecular Biology of the Cell and so our data will potentially impact on future editions of standard texts. 
 The researchers employed on this grant will gain technical skills in cutting edge methodology in protein chemistry and protein biophysics and in the application of such techniques in complex systems involving integral membrane systems. The researchers will also gain writing, IT, and presentational skills. Researchers on BBSRC grants in our laboratories have the opportunity to take part in Departmental Science Open Days (typically putting on practical demonstrations in protein science or bacteriology).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319488</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Sciences Division</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Biochemistry</gtr:department><gtr:description>BCB</gtr:description><gtr:id>930C3B83-F8E8-4251-83AA-FA02ACB9CD94</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Many joint papers and joint grant funding.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Sharing reagents and protocols.

Teachers were engaged prior to the event and were enrolled as members of the Society for General Microbiology. Children were challenged prior to the event about what they associated with the word microbe. On the day we had 10 hands on stands (Day 1 was the schoolchildren, day two was the general public). I had a stall entitled 'where our medicines come from' and children isolated soil microbes. After the event the children went away and with their teachers performed microbiology experiments. About six weeks later the children returned to visit us at the University of Dundee for an open evening where they presented posters outlining their experiment and art work of microbes. Word association showed that the children had assimilated information from the event and that their perception of microbes had changed. The event featured in local press and on local radio.
