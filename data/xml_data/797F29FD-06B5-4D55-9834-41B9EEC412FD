In recent years network-based approaches have greatly enhanced our understanding of the links among species in terms of both mutualistic and antagonistic relationships. Plant-pollinator interactions are the most widely studied mutualism at the community level, and construction of flower-visitation networks has moved pollination ecology beyond traditional one plant-one visitor studies. A network-approach is vital for predictions of how communities respond to climate change, to introduced non-native species, and to species extinction, and is important for conservation of natural ecosystems and maintained pollination as an ecosystem service to underpin food security. 
In one respect, however, existing networks are limited. Flower visitation networks do not equate to flower pollination networks, since not all visitors effectively transfer conspecific pollen to a receptive stigma, as required for fertilisation and seed set. Furthermore, many flower visitors cheat, taking pollen or nectar without providing a pollination service. Our pilot studies show that only a proportion of visitors do transfer conspecific pollen, this proportion varying markedly between plant species. Visitation networks may therefore under-emphasise the specialisation of plant-pollinator interactions.
The inclusion of a measure of pollinator effectiveness in visitation networks is thus essential to prove pollinator functionality and ensure appropriate use of such networks in modelling complex ecological interactions. Our pilot work confirms that single visit pollen deposition (SVD), by a flower visitor onto a receptive stigma, provides an ideal and practical measure of individual pollinator effectiveness. SVD can then be combined with flower visitation frequency to build a more accurate and realistic picture of pollinator importance for a particular plant species.
In this project we will measure the pollination effectiveness, as SVD, of visitors to flowers (at the species level) in previously published visitation networks at sites chosen for the quality of existing data and for varying environmental impacts: low diversity UK heathland, very high diversity Israeli pine forest, and moderate diversity Kenyan savannah. At each site we will collect data to allow daily temporal resolution to be incorporated in networks, revealing how pollinator effectiveness varies on a daily timescale, in relation to pollen availability, nectar resources, and associated microclimate variation. 
This work will enable us to generate true pollination networks, and to answer key questions regarding the usefulness of current visitation networks:
1) How do visitation and pollination networks correspond and/or differ in their predictions of community specialisation, and how does this vary with different visitor and flower diversities? From this, better appreciation of the relative value of existing networks can be achieved. 
2) How great is the variation in pollinator effectiveness within functional groups of visitors? Do networks constructed at the species level differ, and do they again vary with site diversity?
3) How well can other measurements, already used as proxies by some authors adequately predict pollinator effectiveness?
4) How are predictions of network stability, and the associated consequences of species extinction, altered by inclusion of more robust pollinator effectiveness data into networks?
The answers to these questions will have important implications for the future use of plant-pollinator networks in conservation policy decisions, and will provide valuable support for projects in NERC's Insect Pollinators Initiative.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outputs from the project will benefit a diverse range of non-academics. Our results will be of importance to conservation practitioners working at the community level in various habitats, and through them of interest to policy makers. We will also communicate our research to the public through school visits, public talks and blog postings.
The importance of a deep understanding of pollination ecology cannot be underestimated. Around 78% of temperate flowering plants rely on insect pollination to maintain their genetic diversity. In the UK alone, the yields of over 20 crop species are increased by pollination services. But where pollinator species diversity is low, crop yields may suffer. Managed Apis bees alone are often not enough to produce market-quality fruits, with native pollinators providing a better service; and insects also pollinate nitrogen-fixing plants that improve crop and pasture productivity. As honeybee numbers decline, we need to understand how a wider range of visitors interact with flowers and identify precisely which species the plants rely on in different environments.
We will address these issues by analysing behaviour of individual species in depositing pollen, providing crucial information about the reliability of networks throughout the world. Our findings will have important implications for the conclusions of both existing and forthcoming studies and so will help to advise conservation and agricultural policy. The project will thus complement and contribute valuable information to NERC's Insect Pollinators Initiative (in which Dr Baldock and Prof Memmott are already playing key roles).
- At all study sites our research will improve the knowledge-base of pollinators by linking with local researchers and conservationists. Through the relationships built by Prof Memmott and Dr Baldock as part of the UK Insect Pollinators Initiative team we already have strong links with conservation practitioners within the UK. In Kenya dissemination of our research findings to relevant practitioners will involve information exchange with the African Pollinator Initiative, with which Prof Willmer already has links.
- We will write articles for journals such as British Wildlife and Conservation Land Management, more relevant to conservation practitioners.
- We will work hard to publicise the project and the wider importance of pollinator research through interactions with the media and the public.
- A project website will be set up dedicated to the project and designed to appeal to the public as well as research colleagues. It will provide updates on the progress of the project and information and photographs of the species and science involved.
- Talks and demonstrations will be given at local primary schools in the UK and Kenya and at UK science festivals. Through discussions with teachers we can introduce pollination ecology to the students in a way that integrates with their curriculum. Dr Ballantyne currently gives regular talks at primary schools in Fife and this project would allow him to maintain and enhance links with teachers here.
- We will facilitate links between enthusiastic school classes in the UK and Kenya to start a cultural exchange. Students will have the opportunity to talk via email and Skype, and share information about flowering plants and pollinators in their area.
Throughout our public engagements we will emphasise the importance of pollinator diversity, challenging the often exaggerated role of honeybees and focusing on other groups of flower visitors. The diverse variety of potential pollinators is not just biologically fascinating, but also crucial for agriculture and food security. We will listen to feedback from our audiences to discover what enthuses them about the topic, what they would like to learn more about and what related research they would like to see being funded.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-03-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>568118</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Dr Gavin Ballantyne was the winner of the Ecosystems and Communities category of the British Ecological Society photography competition in 2013 with a photograph of a crab spider on a rhododendron flower, taken while carrying our fieldwork in Dorset.

To do this we assessed visitation rate of insects to flowers as well as pollen deposition onto stigmas by the visitors in 3 very different plant communities, over 5 seasons of fieldwork.

Firstly, the project has produced 3 unique databases of pollen deposition, in which we know the identity of the flower visitor and the nature of the visit itself. This has allowed us to investigate which pollinators move significant amounts of pollen onto stigmas of a wide variety of plant species and if any particular insects are universally good at the community level. We have also combined these measures of pollen deposition with visitation rates, to obtain measures of pollinator importance of individual insect species for each plant species.

Secondly, this data allowed us to construct interaction networks that take into account visitation rate alone, or the combined measure of pollinator importance. We discovered that when viewed through the lens of pollinator importance, plant communities are moderately, but consistently, more specialised in their interactions with potential pollinators than if visit data alone is used. This finding has consequences for how we evaluate the robustness of a plant community to change.

Thirdly, by carrying out assessments of pollen deposition at the community scale for the first time, we now have a very good idea of how much of a plant community can realistically be surveyed. Any study of community pollination ecology is a trade-off between understanding the pollination biology of the individual species involved and investigating the wider community interactions. We have now shown that it is practical to obtain pollen deposition data for a large number of floriferous plant species in a community. This may encourage other researchers to tackle a wider range of questions in pollination ecology.

Fourthly, we have also collected some of the first data on heterospecific pollen deposition. This was found to be very low in most cases. This backs up reports from other recent studies and suggests that the risk of heterospecific pollen clogging has been overestimated in the literature.

Finally, our interest in the quality of pollen received by plants has led to a successful research project carried out by Robert Patchett. Here we show that the amount of pollen deposited onto turnip (Brassica rapa) stigmas is positively correlated with pollen tube growth, indicating a positive correlation with high quality, non-self pollen.We also demonstrate the use of turnip as a model organism for the detection of both non-self pollen as well as self pollen, due to properties of stigma morphology and the staining techniques employed.

These findings have already led to the publication of Ballantyne et al (2015) in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, focusing on work done in Dorset. A summary of the findings focusing on bees ability to transfer pollen has been accepted for publication in Arthropod Plant Interactions (Willmer et al, 2017) and our study of pollen quality on turnip pollination has been accepted for publication in the Journal of Pollination Ecology (Patchett et al, 2017). A further 3 papers will be published on work carried out in Israel and Kenya, including the primary datasets from both sites. The success of this project has taken us a significant step closer to understanding how pollination occurs at the community level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have seen a great deal of interest in the methods pioneered by this project from pollination biologists. The work has already led to a successful collaboration with with Dr Riikka Kaartinen and Prof Graham Stone of the University of Edinburgh, offering advice and assistance studying pollen movement in a high Arctic environment in Greenland.

Our findings will help researchers to gauge the scale of data collection needed to obtain estimates of pollinator effectiveness at the community level, which will be useful in the planning of future experiments. The project findings will hopefully encourage investigations into the pollination of a wider range of plant species, to help us better predict how dependent plant species are on individual pollinator populations. 

By modelling community dynamics with novel types of datasets, like those collected over the course of this project, will help us to understand how variable the outcomes of these ecological models are. This will give conservationists and policy makers better confidence in the robustness of model estimates.

Through ongoing outreach work, our findings will also raise awareness of the variety of different potential pollinators and the need to maintain a rich diversity of flower visitors, to ensure we can rely on healthy pollination ecosystem services.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>18F36ADD-7DB1-46F3-8A56-67E0C19214FE</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in the Scottish Pollinator Strategy consultation</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1170768A-F830-4E4B-AB8E-E49A68B294AC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.snh.gov.uk/about-scotlands-nature/species/invertebrates/land-invertebrates/pollinator-strategy-consultation/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Constructing more informative plant-pollinator networks: visitation and pollen deposition networks in a heathland plant community 2015
