&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>How can we conceptualise the City as a policy actor? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How does the City try to shape the regulatory agenda at multiple levels? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What has been the impact of the global financial crisis on its policy role? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what extent have its regulatory policy preferences been redefined? &lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How can we explain the City?s influence within the policy process? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>The study explores the political role of the City by mapping its policy preferences and lobbying strategies at the national, European and international level. It does so by analysing a series of case studies related to recent regulatory reform negotiations, including the Basel 3 agreement and EU Capital Requirements Directive IV. The project will draw upon extensive survey data and in-depth interviews with policy makers, industry regulators, trade representatives and members of leading City firms to provide a rich empirical account of how this critically important but hitherto neglected actor wields influence within the policy process.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The study will benefit the following users:

1. Academics and researchers
By unpacking the black box of the City of London, the study offers a highly innovative conceptualisation of the City as a policy actor for the first time: its membership, mechanisms of coordination, policy preferences, and lobbying strategies. The research will pioneer, test and refine a new framework for analysing the role and power of international financial centres in multi-level policy processes, and explaining how and why they have adapted to the global financial crisis. The framework will benefit other academics and researchers working in this rapidly expanding field as it will be designed for use in future comparative and international studies.

2. International collaborators
The study is designed to facilitate international collaboration in two ways. First, the research will bring together a critical mass of researchers through two workshops and a collaborative monograph, intended to showcase cutting-edge research on the City of London. Second, the study will lead to the formation of a new BISA Working Group on the Politics of Financial Services. This will form the basis for the development of a future research agenda and international collaboration through the establishment of an international network of researchers from New York, Singapore and Hong Kong.

3. Government and regulators
The research will provide a detailed historical record of practitioner opinion before and after the financial crisis: the network of actors involved in regulatory reform, internal (City) policy beliefs and preferences, and external (EU/international) perceptions of the UK financial services industry. No dataset of this nature currently exists. Understanding how the City has adapted to heightened levels of political and public scrutiny may be used by UK and EU policy makers in the design of future financial regulation and UK negotiating strategies aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of public policy. Engagement with these actors will be facilitated through the City Consultation Group, Research Briefings and two workshops.

4. Trade representatives and industry lobbyists
It will offer a valuable comparison of the City's lobbying strategies, tactics and narratives during the Basel 2/CRD and Basel 3/CRD IV negotiations, allowing industry representatives to evaluate and draw lessons from these experiences. This knowledge may contribute directly to changes in the external representation of the UK financial services sector aimed at maximising the City's international influence and economic competitiveness. This learning exercise is likely to be particularly useful for City-wide associations (TheCityUK and City of London Corporation) that seek to provide a more coherent voice for the City as a whole. They will play an active role through the Consultation Group, briefings and workshops.

5. Interest groups and political parties
Current debates surrounding the need to re-balance the UK economy towards other sectors means that the findings will be of great interest to interest groups and political parties concerned with the role and influence of the banking industry in the policy process. By providing important new empirical information about the sources and location of the City's political power and its changing relationship with government, it may assist those wishing to understand and/or challenge it more effectively.

6. The media and wider public
The project aims to transcend commonly held assumptions about the privileged position of the City of London within the UK polity by systematically mapping its role in the policy process for the first time. This is intended to increase transparency and raise public awareness about a relatively unknown policy actor, and so contribute to a more informed media and public debate. The publication of media reports and the public Roundtable Debate will provide a forum for engaging a wider audience in the research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>95386</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Modul University Vienna</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Austria, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Dr Dimitris Christopoulos, Vienna</gtr:description><gtr:id>E25684DD-4A4A-4DF7-92DB-B83C39F5FFD5</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>As part of the fieldwork, I am currently collaborating with a colleague at Modul Universuity Vienna to develop and undertake formal Social Network Analysis of bank lobbying networks in the UK.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented at the International Conference of Europeanists, Council for European Studies, Paris, July 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>47CC6FAB-578A-4597-8D45-21AC3FA2169A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Paper presented at the 22nd International Conference of Europeanists, Council for European Studies, Paris, 8-10 July 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference presentation at ECPR Regulation and Governance Conference, Tilburg</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>782402DE-EE44-4094-B99B-18B3C9CD9925</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference presentation at ECPR Regulation and Governance Conference, Tilburg</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited to present to Centre for Competition Policy Conference, UEA</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>878CB0D3-1E25-4444-9831-736BB0683849</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present to audience of practitioners, policy makers and academics at Centre for Competition Policy Conference, UEA</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Paper presented at the BISA 39th Annual Conference, Dublin, June 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3D70A86-4A5D-459E-B010-C9C64CD8BB46</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Networking with academics working in a similar field, discussion of research and potential future research collaboration.

1. Practitioner engagement

The study engaged with financial industry regulators and practitioners in a mutual learning process. This took a variety of forms. First, a City Consultation Group was established at an early stage to assist with project planning and development. This enabled the PI to develop a unique and extensive network of contacts with senior UK politicians, regulators and industry practitioners. The group also served as a valuable source of advice throughout the project on how to tailor the research findings to its target user audience and maximise its policy impact. Second, two workshops were organised in central London which brought together leading researchers, regulators, trade representatives and industry commentators. The first, held in April 2013, helped to build important new academic and industry contacts, assist the mapping of the City policy network, and facilitate learning between different user communities. The second in May 2014 was an opportunity to disseminate the research findings to a range of user communities by engaging in learning and lesson drawing about the impact of the financial crisis. 

2. Policy consultancy 

The success of the project at engaging end users was demonstrated by the invitation in April 2013 to undertake external consultancy work for the British Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (BVCA) on the UK's role in the negotiation of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD). Administrative and financial support was provided to the PI over a twelve-month period to undertake additional document and interview-based research. Interviews were conducted with senior practitioners in the private equity and venture capital industry in London, Paris and Brussels between September 2013 and June 2014. This provided the PI with a level of access to both individuals and information which would not otherwise have been possible. 

The consultancy work culminated in the publication of a Policy Report aimed at facilitating learning and lesson drawing about how the industry can engage more effectively in the EU policy process (link below). The report was commissioned by industry to encourage practitioners to critically reflect on their own role in the regulatory reform process and think about how they can make a positive contribution to designing better regulation in the financial sector. Similarly, it is intended that financial regulators will also make use of the report as a way of understanding how to engage with industry lobbyists more constructively and to better communicate the type of information and data that trade associations can usefully provide to regulators as part of the policy making process.

The report was launched at a high-profile industry reception held at the House of Commons in September 2014 hosted by former Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mark Hoban MP. My intention is to use this experience as an impact case study for the Research Excellence Framework 2020.

3. Book proposal

The PI intends to maximise the dissemination of the project's findings to a wider public audience through the development of a book proposal. This aims to fill a gap in the market for an accessible text which provides an empirically-rich analysis of the UK's changing role and influence in Europe since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. It offers a unique opportunity to assess the UK's successes and failures in its ability to shape the reform of European economic governance. It will also draw lessons for the future of the UK's engagement with Europe in anticipation of the forthcoming referendum on EU membership. I have begun approaching leading publishers (Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press and Palgrave Macmillan) to identify the nature and scope of the publishing market.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>609F057E-95FA-4DCE-94C3-0C9949652474</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. New knowledge

The research has generated new knowledge about the role of the City of London as a multi-level policy actor in shaping financial regulatory reform. Since the crisis this has given rise to new forms collective action through institution-building and resource investment in pan-City lobbying activities. However this has met with mixed results. At the international and European levels, the City found itself at odds with the UK government and fought unsuccessfully to prevent UK regulators from securing the right to impose higher capital requirements on its own banks over and above minimum EU standards agreed in the EU Capital Requirements Directive IV. At the national level the research charts the role of the City during the three stages of the banking reform process between 2010-2013: from the Independent Commission on Banking to the Banking Reform Bill and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. The study reveals significant internal divisions in the preferences of industry and that the influence of different stakeholders changes as the institutional 'rules of the game' vary over time. It explains the outcome of the process - the 'ringfencing' of UK retail banking - as the result of a carefully crafted bargain between the Bank of England and Parliament on the one hand and the CBI and most of the main UK banks on the other. These findings draw on unprecedented access to key regulators and industry practitioners to produce an empirically rich and historically important dataset.

2. New research methods

The analysis of the UK banking reform process has pioneered new research methods for mapping and understanding the nature of lobbying networks within the financial industry. The study employs policy network analysis to map the constellation of actors, and the exchange of information resources between them, involved in the Independent Commission on Banking. This mixed-methods approach combines both quantitative and qualitative datasets in order to understand the relationship between network centrality and policy entrepreneurship amongst private stakeholders. It also makes an important theoretical contribution by using state-of-the-art Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) to test a series of hypotheses about the importance of key agency attributes in explaining network structure. The formal modelling confirms existing research about the association of centrality with leadership and issue salience, but also reveals unexpected results such as the negative association with utility loss and organisational trust. It is hoped that these innovative research methods will stimulate further investigation into the nature of lobbying networks in an effort to better understand regulatory reform outcomes.

3. New research networks

The study has necessitated important new collaborations with academics at the University of Manchester (during the early planning and network-building stage) and at Modul University Vienna (in order to conduct the policy network analysis and build the ERGM). Wider networking activity with other international academics at the University of East Anglia, University College London, European University Institute and University of California Berkeley are intended to foster future joint research and potential large grant applications. The study has also engaged financial industry practitioners through consultation work culminating in the publication of a high impact policy report.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Academic researchers may wish to build on this important study by applying the innovative mixed-methods approach to analyse lobbying networks around other financial regulations or in different regulatory sectors. The study showcases the use of policy network analysis and ERGM in this field and it is hoped that this will yield valuable future comparative insights about the outcome of regulatory reform processes. It is also intended that the research will lead to important new collaborations between experts in this field and the generation of future large grant applications. Practitioners may utilise the broader policy implications to engage in learning and lesson drawing about the regulatory reform process. For example, industry will use the research to reflect on how they can make a positive contribution to designing better regulation in the financial sector. Similarly regulators will find the results valuable as a way of understanding how to insulate regulatory processes from industry influence or 'capture'.
