Alzheimer's disease</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L001810/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is often mis-perceived as a disorder largely or solely of memory. However the disease also affects the visual areas of the brain leading to problems seeing what and where things are. Dementia-related visual impairment tends to be neglected, partly because people assume any problems are due to the eyes rather than the brain, and because it occurs at a point when language and other skills are too impaired for the person with dementia to explain the perceptual problems they are having. Visual problems are also often mis-attributed to poor memory (e.g. a person with AD failing to recognize a family member in a photo may be thought to have &amp;quot;forgotten&amp;quot; the person, when in fact they may simply be unable to perceive the face clearly). Visual impairment in AD has received increased attention recently with the identification of the syndrome Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) which is typically caused by AD but presents with dramatic impairment of vision not memory, as experienced and described by the author Terry Pratchett in his documentary Living with Alzheimer's.

Very few studies have explored the effect of impaired vision upon people with dementia or their caregivers. A motivation for improving our understanding of how people with AD see the world is that the limited number of small studies which have been conducted suggest that even simple changes to the environment (e.g. changing the colour of tableware from white to red) can compensate for vision problems in people with AD and lead to improved functioning and health (e.g. better eating and drinking).

The project objective is to demonstrate that helping AD patients to interact more successfully with their visual environment at home can have a significant positive impact upon the wellbeing and quality of life of both patients and carers. The project will involve 50 people with PCA, 150 with typical Alzheimer's disease and 100 healthy volunteers. The impact of visual aids and strategies will be measured at three time-points over the course of one year, with a staggered start to enable comparisons of quality of life in those with and without the intervention. The success of the project will be judged primarily using established measures of quality of life, caregiver burden, everyday abilities, and behavioural and psychological wellbeing. However, the design of the visual aids and compensatory strategies themselves will be based upon a combination of patient/carer interviews (qualitative evidence) and cutting-edge scientific understanding of the nature of visual impairments caused by conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (quantitative evidence). This quantitative evidence will be gathered through studies of patient's visual skills and eye movements, and their ability to move around a purpose-built laboratory environment, before the main study commences in patients' own homes.

Another important aspect of the project is the involvement of people with PCA, who experience AD-related visual loss but without the loss of memory and insight seen in typical AD. These individuals with PCA offer a new and unique perspective on the AD patient's view of the world. Their experiences of care homes and day hospitals draws attention to the fact that many current social and behavioural interventions for people with dementia may be limited in their effectiveness by over-reliance upon visual information and by a systemic failure to recognize visual impairment in many service users.

The research brings together experts in the fields of dementia, engineering, social science, social work, occupational therapy and ophthalmology. This interdisciplinary research team will work closely with the DeNDRoN ENRICH scheme and project advisors in the 3rd sector and industry specializing in dementia and vision loss (e.g. Thomas Pocklington Trust, Dementia and Sight Loss Interest Group, ARUP, CDRAKE) to improve the study and implement its findings.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Patients and carers:
o Making available novel low-cost visual aids and adaptations to improve localization of places and objects around the home
o Providing practical tips and advice that may permit novel problem solving around the home.
o Consequent improvements in patient independence, safety and quality of life and associated reductions in caregiver burden.
o Benefit delivered directly via support groups (patient and carer support groups, consultation, newsletters and website; e.g. www.pcasupport.ucl.ac.uk), discussion forums (e.g. www.pcaforum.org), Facebook groups (e.g. Posterior Cortical Atrophy Awareness; Australia PCA Support), and indirectly by spreading best practice among clinicians working with people with PCA, AD and other dementias via project advisors (e.g. Canadian Dementia Resource and Knowledge Exchange [CDRAKE]).

Social science and policy:
o Reviewing and revising guidelines, policies and advice regarding dementia-related visual dysfunction in the home and care home environment.
o Highlighting the previously unresearched relationship between dementia-related visual impairment and quality of life.
o Improving the evidence base for the improving the interaction between people with dementia and their environment as a means to reducing health and social care costs.

Clinicians:
o Guidance as to the provision of individualized recommendations of aids most likely to benefit everyday functioning, by establishing the relationship between specific aids and an individual's profile of visual dysfunction as measured on brief bedside visual screening tests (e.g. Cortical Visual Screening Test; CORVIST).

Allied health professionals:
o The involvement of social workers and occupational therapists in the core study team will ensure that study outcomes are practical and feasible for use by colleagues in community-based dementia services, and will shape recommendations for necessary professional training developments. 
o Facilitating patients' interactions with their visual environment will lead to improvements in physical health and nutrition. For example, simple changes in the colour of tableware (to compensate for reduced visual contrast sensitivity) have been shown to increase food and fluid consumption in advanced AD (Dunne et al., 2004).
o Improved visual awareness and perception of object and obstacle locations within the home (e.g. furniture, stairs) is likely to lead to increased mobility and safety, with fewer falls, accidents and consequent in-patient admissions.
o Improvements in patient mobility, safety and independence within the home will also delay admission to higher-intensity residential settings and reduce carer burden.

Care home industry including architects, engineers and care home managers:
o See 'Allied health professionals' above, plus:
o Providing evidence-based advice and information on the effectiveness and use of both novel and currently available visual aids, which may influence design and layout of new and existing residential care settings.
o The study team will provide 'Not seeing but believing'* training on dementia-related visual impairment to care home staff not just at the end but also at the outset of the study, via DeNDRoN's research ready care home network.
*cf 'Seeing is believing' visits cited in the York case study of dementia-friendly communities (Department of Health, 2012, p14) to share good practice between residential and nursing care specialists.

General public:
o Improving awareness of the global nature of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia.
o Increased understanding of difficulties potentially faced by relatives, friends, clients, customers, etc. with dementia.
o Information delivered via support group websites, discussion forums, Facebook groups (see 'Patients and carers' section above for details), and general interest Alzheimer's news groups (e.g. Alzforum; http://alzforum.org/new/detail.asp?id=3224).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>2115953</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Seeing what they see team members and participants are working with architects Niall McLaughlin and Yeoryia Manolopoulou as they explore people with dementia's experience of space and design, and the successes and failures of McLaughlin's Alzheimer's Respite Centre (https://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/architecture/research/projects/respite-centre).</gtr:description><gtr:id>BD7A0A9A-306E-4987-9D2B-BB27F30C455B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As the Venice Architecture Biennale is an impressive, large-scale showcase of contemporary architecture, it is a unique opportunity to present to attendees the link between navigation and dementia: the project itself will explore the idea of the quality of life of people with dementia and how this may be impacted by their interactions with their environment.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Venice Biennale Irish exhibi</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.archdaily.com/777648/niall-mclaughlin-architects-selected-to-represent-ireland-at-2016-venice-biennale</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>This was a collaboration with Charles Harrison, a visual artist, in which four individuals with different forms of dementia (PCA, behavioural variant FTD, semantic dementia, typical Alzheimer's disease) and healthy control artists (x4) created still life paintings of the same set of objects to illustrate the impact of different dementias upon different cognitive processes (e.g. perception, emotion, verbal knowledge).

Event summary

There are 850,000 people with dementia in the UK and 7 out of 10 of those are living with another medical condition or disability. Sight loss is a particularly devastating condition for anyone, especially for those with concurrent dementia. It is not difficult to comprehend that there are specific difficulties for people who have both dementia and sight loss combined.

The awareness of the problems faced by those affected by vision or visual perception conditions and dementia is very low and this half day session is designed to help you understand the issues and clinical standards.

Better understanding of the prevalence of dementia and sight loss and issues with vision faced by people living with dementia will enable us to give better care and improve the quality of life for this growing group within the population.

The sessions will be repeated in the morning and afternoon to allow for easier attendance, so you can choose to attend either a morning or afternoon session.

After each session there will be a panel discussion with all the experts from the day including VISION 2020 UK, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, the College of Optometrists, Alzheimer's Society, RNIB, University College London and ABDO.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.vision2020uk.org.uk/57233-2/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>AAIC 2014 talk Copenhagen</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4EBD5114-06E2-49A0-B594-D2AB336FD1A1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Atypical AD Professional Interest Area (PIA) meeting in particular prompted lots of interest in PCA and other forms of atypical AD, contributed to ongoing project to revise criteria for PCA and brought in new PIA members.

? Development of tests to more reliably assess acuity (the ability to see small items) and crowding (the influence of 'visual clutter') in posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)/typical Alzheimer's disease (tAD).
? Eye movement abnormalities are near-ubiquitous in PCA, though both PCA and tAD patients show deficits in visual search and smooth pursuit.
? Salient features of scenes are more consistently fixated in PCA, with tAD patients showing an intermediate tendency to fixate areas of high salience
? Everyday abilities also undermined by problems in auditory scene analysis, motor and balance systems.
? Continued work to highlight visual impairment in a range of dementia syndromes. 
? Majority of PCA patients exhibit excessive visual crowding.
? PCA reading adversely affected by increased letter spacing, size, length and font.
? Development and piloting of computer-based reading aid informed by work in crowding and acquired dyslexia in PCA.

Preparatory study 2
? Successfully devised aid to improve reading ability in PCA; patients' difficulties moving their eyes to each word circumvented by moving the words to the point of gaze. Mean reading accuracy was significantly higher with the aid (96%) than normal text (57%).
? Development of paradigms for quantitative assessment of navigating doorways, corridors, rooms, stairs, and locating objects, with simultaneous evaluation of speed, efficiency, gait, gaze position and route under varying conditions.
? PCA and tAD patients get lost even in simple environments with destination in view.
? Clear effects of the physical environment on patient performance (e.g. increasing route complexity in corridors task impacts negatively on PCA&amp;gt;tAD&amp;gt;controls; visual clutter impairs PCA navigation and object localisation performance).
? Effects of lighting are inconsistent (not as simple as 'higher lighting levels improve performance').
? Contrast cue improved door finding efficiency and accuracy in patients; increase in speed more apparent for moderate than mild patients (based on MMSE).
? Motion cue increased probability of fixating target destination, door finding accuracy in patients, and resulted in more direct routes to the target for tAD group (&amp;quot;locking on&amp;quot;?).
? Patient navigational ability is predicted by deficits in visual search and perceiving objects in clutter.
? Patient navigational ability can also be facilitated by the direction of local lighting, even if overall lighting levels remain unchanged.

Preparatory study 3
? First study evaluating impact of PCA and tAD on activities of daily living.
? Systematic reviews of stress and coping mechanisms and environment adaptations in AD.
? Description of existing individual and group interventions for PCA.
? Professional interviews with OTs, SWs, nursing home staff, sensory teams) revealed preliminary evidence of only generalised dementia training, PWD difficulties most often attributed to memory, and visual problems often attributed to poor eye health or described as a natural part of ageing.
? Prominent features of patient &amp;amp; carer individual and diad interviews included: difficulties with ADLs situated within complex psychosocial environment; maintenance of identity; dependence, independence and interdependence; isolation and social exclusion; previous losses (e.g. death of a child, occupation); other illnesses; relationship quality.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We are at the beginning of our project but the key impact and communications objectives are: 

Build awareness of dementia-related visual impairment amongst the general public:
- Improve awareness that dementia may impact upon vision and not just memory.
- Improve awareness of rare and young onset dementias such as posterior cortical atrophy (PCA).

Build awareness of the 'Seeing what they see' project amongst people with PCA and Alzheimer's disease and their carers:
- Disseminate guidelines and advice to help address problems associated with dementia-related visual impairment around the home.
- Make available novel low-cost visual aids and adaptations to improve localization of places and objects around the home
- Disseminate research findings on how to improve patient independence, safety and quality of life and associated reductions in caregiver burden.
- Present project plans and regular project updates at patient and carer support group meetings, in newsletters, on support group websites (www.pcasupport.ucl.ac.uk), via Facebook groups (e.g. Posterior Cortical Atrophy Awareness; Australia PCA Support) and via @DementiaVision Twitter feed.
- Disseminate research findings via project partners (e.g. Thomas Pocklington Trust, Canada Dementia Resource and Knowledge Exchange) and other care organisations.

Build awareness of the 'Seeing what they see' project amongst academics, clinicians and allied health professionals:
- Provide guidance and formal training course modules regarding the identification of dementia-related visual dysfunction and implementation of research findings.
- Present research findings at local, national and international academic and professional conferences, and publish in high-quality journals. 

Influence policymakers and those planning and managing care services to improve diagnosis, care and support for people with dementia-related visual impairment:
- Reviewing and revising guidelines, policies and advice regarding dementia-related visual dysfunction in the home and care home environment.
- Highlighting the previously unresearched relationship between dementia-related visual impairment and quality of life.
- Improving the evidence base for the improving the interaction between people with dementia and their environment as a means to reducing health and social care costs.

Care home industry including architects, engineers and care home managers:
- Communicate the needs of people with dementia-related visual impairment to those involved in the design, construction and management of residential care and nursing facilities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6EBAE0D1-7F98-4DF7-A95A-1671E7D8C774</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dementia-vision</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>JPND committee on cognitive assessments</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B8DA7A84-088E-4435-B984-A678723498FF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>House of Lords young onset dementia awareness raising event</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7AE93D3D-8EAD-4ABE-9EB2-750AAAF57FE6</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentations at professional training events (College of Optometrists January/June 2016 and 100% Optical events February 2015/2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D2C1EEB-122F-4002-9CC7-296BC7A50FCF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentations at multiple events in 2015-2016 organised by the College of Optometrists and 100% Optical highlighting PCA, corticovisual impairment in neurodegenerative conditions and outlining issues when assessing visual function in people with dementia. Raising awareness of PCA among optometrists was identified as a key priority for patients based on feedback from PCA support groups. A total of 6,400 people attended the first 100% Optical event. Learning objectives for the seminar 'Dementia- understanding the needs of patients in a clinical setting' were as follows:
1. Understand key facts about dementia: signs, symptoms and prevalence. 
2. Gain insight into the experience of a person with dementia trying to access care. 
3. Understand the particular needs of patients with unusual forms of dementia, particularly the cortical visual impairments in posterior cortical atrophy.
4. Reflect on methods to adapt assessments to support the individual's unique abilities and needs

Over 90% of those who rated the session reported it meeting the learning objectives.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Presentation at and participation in Vision Impairment and Dementia Summit (College of Optometrists; February 2015).</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED755713-5692-4B1D-B304-FBEF3C6F4F12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This event explored particular issues for people with concurrent dementia and visual impairment or sight loss. The event helped develop collaborative work between the college of optometrists and the Dementia Research Centre, and raised awareness about PCA and corticovisual impairment arising as a consequence of Alzheimer's disease. 
? Brought together two James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships (dementia and vision) to identify five priorities for dementia and vision research:
o appropriate methods of visual assessment
o how to maintain independence
o the timing of cataract intervention
o how to effectively change practice with research
o routes to early dementia diagnosis
? The discussions also revealed some key underlying themes in the participants' thinking:
o the extent to which these two conditions are uniquely concurrent, or not, compared to other co-morbidities
o the importance of linking communities of research and health care together, both within each community and with each other
o that listening to patients and carers is crucial to the progression of effective research.
? Summit demonstrated the usefulness of such an exercise and its viability for the prioritisation of research into other health co-morbidities.
? The priorities will be disseminated widely and integrated into the processes used by research funders to evaluate funding applications, and through which research teams identify future projects, to ensure funding is directed to the areas of most use for people living with dementia and visual impairment.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.college-optometrists.org/en/college/news/index.cfm/Visual_Impairment_Dementia_Summit</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Workshop on dementia related visual impairment at COTEC - ENOTHE Congress (Galway, June 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F555DCE1-73A8-43A0-99A9-8FE0AF58B112</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Membership of British Psychological Society Dementia Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B0D58377-42C5-456A-9ACC-71A6F159D60E</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Health Building Note</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E07D1756-51BC-4C94-98F2-FCCFCCD35696</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Design principles for dementia-friendly environments in new healthcare buildings, and in the adaptation or extension of existing facilities</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Participation in a national consultation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dementia-friendly-health-and-social-care-environments-hbn-08-02</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dementia and Sight Loss Interest Group (DaSLIG)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0BA5649-D3AF-480C-8A36-D17C3D7F5B91</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Comprises Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB), Alzheimer's Society, Thomas Pocklington Trust, Arup, Macular Disease Society and a number healthcare professionals and service users.
