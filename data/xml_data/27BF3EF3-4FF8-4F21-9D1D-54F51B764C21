SIMULATION</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/H004319/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Electrical double layer capacitors (EDC) store energy using accumulation of ions of opposite charge in a nano-thick layer at high surface area electrodes. They can complement batteries in energy storage and harvesting, when high power density and fast delivery or uptake is needed. A notable improvement of EDCs has been achieved due to advances in nano-structured materials. Experimental results of the Gogotsi group that show that desolvation of electrolyte ions in pores smaller than the size of solvated ions. leads to higher capacitance, opened the door to improved devices using a variety of electrolytes. In the absence of faradic reactions across the interface, which degrade electrodes in batteries during charge/discharge cycles, EDCs can sustain millions of cycles, while batteries survive a few thousand at best. But EDCs suffer from a limited energy density. This is why EDC research is largely focused on increasing their energy performance and widening the temperature limits into the range where batteries experience thermal runaway (explosion). Energy density is proportional to capacitance and is roughly quadratic in voltage. Thus, the larger voltage window (determined by the electrolyte decomposition and Faraday processes at high potentials) and the larger capacitance are the targets in EDC research. Both are provided by room-temperature Ionic liquids (RTIL) --solvent-free liquid electrolytes; their voltage stability is thus only driven by the electrochemical stability of the ions. As was recently understood, RTILs made a revolution in solution chemistry, because RTILs and their mixtures are the 'designer solvents/electrolytes' of high fidelity, as they are non-volatile under a wide range of conditions. Many of them are environmentally friendly. These features present a world of advantages, but also a challenge: how to choose the best RTIL for a given application from hundreds available and thousands possible? In EDC-research, this is impossible without deep understanding of the properties of electrical double layer in ionic liquids on flat electrodes, for a start, and electrodes with nano-templated surfaces, as 'designer electrodes' must match the 'designer electrolytes'. Achieving this understanding through the interaction of theory, simulations and experiments is the task of this proposal. We will perform modelling and simulation of equilibrium properties, such as capacitance, and transport-dynamics to determine how ions diffuse to and from flat carbon and in and out of nano-porous (pore size &amp;lt;2 nm) and mesoporous (2 nm - 10 nm) carbon electrodes. The results will be compared with experimental data obtained on planar graphite, graphite with nano-trenches and nano-templated electrodes built of assemblies of carbon nanotubes. This will be done in a series of RTILs, with systematic variation of asymmetry in the size of cations and anions, and their anisotropy. Of particular interest will be understanding and implementation of the phenomenon recently discovered by Gogotsi: the maximum of capacitance as function of the average pore size, detected in the nano-porous regime. According to preliminary estimates of A. Kornyshev, the latter may be related with the screening of ion-ion interactions in the metallic nano-pores due to image forces. The latter will be incorporated in the simulation force-fields of ion-ion interactions. Of special interest will be the effects of polarity of EDCs caused by the interplay between different pore sizes on the two electrodes and different sizes of cations and anions. The project is conducted in collaboration between researchers from Drexel University in Philadelphia, US, (experiments) and Imperial College, London, UK (modelling). Its completion will bring a new level of understanding of the optimal nano-scale carbon structures and RTILs for optimization of energy storage, charging and power delivery.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>309778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with MIT on ionic liquids at interfaces and confinement</gtr:description><gtr:id>206E7BDA-521E-4FBB-8B6C-5FC657AC939A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Our first joint publication Physical Review Letters has been cited 220 times (by 05 /03/2016) according to WOS.

Introduction of the wide audiences of electrochemists and engineers to the latest achievement of the project with special focus on nanoporous supercapacitors and electroactuators.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://spring11.ise-online.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This was an &amp;quot;International Cooperation in Chemistry&amp;quot; sister project of the NSF project of Professor Gogotsi at the Drexel University (USA) whose group was responsible for its experimental part; my group responsible for theoretical and simulation background. Generally, we substantially advanced understanding of the structure, electrical response, and charging dynamics of ionic liquids at flat electrodes and in ultrananoporous electrodes, and that understanding has resulted in a number of conclusions potentially of big importance for optimizing electrical properties of supercapacitors and their structures for the maximal energy storage and fast charging-discharging. 

The findings of our work can be split into four categories, and are summarized under each title.

1. Theory of the structure and electrical response of ionic liquids near a flat electrode.

a) The study of the effect of asymmetry of charge distribution in one sort of ions by means a model Monte Carlo simulation has shown the effect of such features on the anatomy of the electrical double layer, changing with voltage variation. It has shown that neutral tails of cations act as latent voids for the voltage-induced rearrangement of the charge, and their mere presence leads to a double-hump camel shape of electrical capacitance of the interface even at high compacity of the liquid, in accordance with experimental observations.

b) We developed a theory of the overscreening effect in the electrical double layer in ionic liquids, by constructing a phenomenological Landau functional and minimizing it to obtain the charge and potential distributions in the double layer and its differential capacitance. The results have shown that overscreening is gradually destroyed by an applied voltage with a crossover to the regime of crowding (the so called 'lattice saturation') in which the capacitance decreases inversely proportionally to the square root of voltage. This was the first theory of this kind ever built. It has shown excellent agreement with our earlier Molecular Dynamic simulations of analogical systems.

2. Electrical response of ionic liquid in nanoconfinement.

Having taken into account that the interionic interactions inside a nanoscale pore of porous electrode are exponentially screened, we were first to build a theory of capacitance of ultra nanoporous electrodes and explain the Simon-Gogotsi anomalous growth of the capacitance per unit surface area with a decrease of the pore size. The structure of the theory is different for slit pores and for cylindrical single-file-like pores. 

 For a slit pore 2-dimensional model for which we have obtained a mean-field solution for the description of equilibrium properties such electrical capacitance and the amound of charge in the pores was developed, whereas for a cylindrical pore we were able to map the problem on exactly-solvable 1- dimensional models of statistical mechanics. 

 For pores strongly adsorbing ions it was a 1d two state Ising model and for any other pores - 1d three state Blume-Emergy-Griffith (BEG) model, both with nearest neighbor interactions, both having exact solutions. For the Ising model a stndard solution was available from textbooks, but for BEG model it had to be developed and we obtained it, having compared it with Monte Carlo simulations. These results are of textbook quality, which were not existing before in the science of nanostructured supercapacitors. 

 The results of all these models qualitatively explained the Simon-Gogotsi effect, but also predicted for the first time interesting dependences of capacitance on voltage. It has been shown, however, that some of those dependences are smeared out by pore size distribution, leading to a much milder voltage dependence. Nevertheless, we have shown that the differential capacitance of the pores diminishes to zero at large voltages, and this happens earlier in narrower pores than in wider pores, although the capacitance of small pores at small voltages is higher. Therefore, we have proposed a concept of an optimal size of the pore for the maximal energy storage at a given operation voltage, and have plotted it as a function of voltage. 

All these findings were tested by computer simulations and compared with Gogotsi experiments; they were pioneering as we were first to report such results.

3. Next we went to terra-incognita: dynamics of charging-discharging of ultra narrow nanopores. Whereas charging of microscopic and mesoscopic pores have been studied in a large number of works by many authors (going back to the transmission line models of De Levi), we were first to analyze these processes in a nanopore. We have build a phenomenological theory of this process, which predicted different modes of pore charging for initially empty (ionophobic) and filled (ionophilic) pores. We find that charging of ionophobic pores proceeds in a front-like way, while charging of ionophilic pores is diffusive; in both cases, however, the accumulated charge grows at the beginning as a square root of time and at long time exponentially reaches saturation. These results have led to suggestions of a two-step complementary optimization of porous electrodes for supercapacitors. In a first step, the optimal pore width is chosen to maximize the stored energy density; in a second step, the optimal pore depth/length (that is, electrode's thickness) is chosen to satisfy the requirement on charging times. All these predictions of the theory has navigated the first molecular dynamic simulation study of the kinetics of charging of slit nanometer pores. The results of the phenomenological theory have been basically reproduced, but with a number of further findings, e.g. dramatic dependence of the diffusion coefficient of ions in the pore on electrode potential; the diffusion coefficient can change 2-3 order of magnitudes together with restructuring the layer of ions in the pore. 

4. Based on our findings about the equilibrium charge storage and charging dynamics in ultra-narrow nanopores, we came to a new concept of the best performance of ionophobic pores and have published a 'pressing-a-spring manifesto' about it in the first issue of Nanoscale Horizon, a call to material scientists to create and test such pores. The research in this direction in the Gogotsi group is ongoing, but we expect that our new concept will be further explored by other groups such Clare Grey group in Cambridge.
 
5. All our theoretical constructions were based on ideally metallic properties of the electrodes. But the electrodes for supercapacitors are usually made of various types of carbon materials. We therefore needed to establish how the effect of electric field penetration into such materials can affect these results. 

 We have found that it renormalizes the effect of pore size on the screening of interionic interactions inside the pore, by just slightly increasing the exponential decay range by the Thomas-Fermi length, which is about 0.2 nm in such materials, thereby not dismissing any of the obtained results. This may be different between two sheets of graphene, where our preliminary results have shown the decay of interaction energy inversely proportional to the cube of radius. But it is still a short range interaction in 2d.

 At flat electrodes, the field penetration into the electrode may have a more profound effect. This has been shown for graphite: at small voltage the capacitance of the interfacial capacitance is actually dominated by graphite, but not by the ionic liquids and it has U-shape as a function of voltage; only at large voltage the contribution to capacitance of the ionic liquid starts to dominate, and the capacitance will decrease with voltage. This perfectly corresponds to available experimental data.

6. We have developed a theory of electroactuators (relatives to capacitors: essentially capacitors with bendable electrodes) with single mobile charge carrier species. The principle of the work of such gadgets is as follows. A ionomer membrane is sandwiched between two nanoscale-thin bendable metallic electrodes, which contains anionic pendant groups that are attached to the rigid polymer backbone, and mobile bulky ionic liquid type cations. A voltage difference between the electrodes generates an electric field that drives mobile cations to migrate to the negative electrode, creating a cation accumulation layer there and a corresponding depletion layer at the positive electrode. Excess of bulky cations creates strain on the cation rich side and their absence on the opposite side causes membrane shrinking, and the plate bends. Just a few volts are needed to achieve substantial bending, making these systems prime candidates for smart robotics and prosthetics, as well as they can generate voltage if you bend them by force, say in a turbulent flow, which can be used for energy generation or sensing. 

 We developed the first transparent analytically tractable theory of electromechanical transduction for such electroactuators, in which the ion distribution and curvature are mutually coupled. We obtained expressions for the dependence of the curvature and charge accumulation on the applied voltage, as well as the electroactuation dynamics, and compared them with literature data. We found that the mechanical or sensor performance of such electroactuators is determined by just three cumulative parameters, permitting a scaling approach to their design.

7. In the follow up work, not initially planned in the project after the project was officially finished: 

(a) We have investigated for the first time, using molecular dynamic simulations, the laws of the friction with ionic liquids filled nanoscale gaps allowing for just several layers of ions. We have studied the role of the charge on the solid plates, which opens new routes for an electrical control of nanoscale friction. We have found that polarizing the plates shifts the shear plane from the fist layer to the middle layers in the gap, which helps both to protect surfaces against wear and dramatically reduce friction. We have been able to characterise the in-plane structure of each layer and thereby give physical interpretation to our findings.

(b) By means of molecular dynamic simulations we have studied electrosorption of water from the bulk ionic liquid (contaminated by small amounts of water) into electrical double layer. We have found statistically preferential positions for water in the double layer and discovered that it will always be presented in the first layer and its population in the first layer increases both for positive and negative polarizations of the electrode, but asymmetrically stronger for positive electrode polarization. All conclusion were made so far only for carbon electrodes. They may appear to be different for metallic electrodes, due to different characters of interactions of cations and anions of ionic liquids and water with those electrodes.

(c) As a follow up development of our study of charging dynamics, we have explored the role of the earlier found effects in the cyclic voltammetry of charging of the same kind of pores, having predicted a number of effects the existence of which could be verified experimentally when the electrodes with monodisperse slit pores would be created.
 
 (d) Having developed a simple theory, we have performed a speculative study of the role of the crowding effect on the rate of electrochemical reaction from ionic liquids controlled by electron transfer. We have found that instead of the classical Tafel law we may encounter with linear dependence of the logarithm of the electrode current on the square root of overpotential. This prediction is not easy to verify because unless special measures are taken, most of the electrode reactions in ionic liquids are diffusion limited. We furthermore intend to develop more sophisticated theory of such reactions (planned within our cooperation with MIT).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is too early to advice on industrial exploitation of these findings, because the pioneering theories resulted from this project should still be developed on a number of fronts, and all (but not only some) of their predictions must be experimentally tested. However, one there is already a large set of such predictions, all formulated in the papers that we have published, concerning the properties of supercapacitors and electroactuators. They are related with the optimal size of pores, optimal operation voltage, the speed and mode of charging-discharging, benefits of ionophilization or ionophobization of the pores, and the role of pore size dispersion. Since supercapacitors are emerging competitors or complementary devices to batteries, all these aspects will be extremely important for the optimization of their energy storage and power delivery, to be achieved not by trial and error, but based on the fundamental theory. This is what the results of this project offer. The same refers to electroactuators, the convertors of electrical energy into motion and vice versa, that are considered to be promising for micro- and nanorobotics, sensors, and alternating-current generators. The potential acquired by this three year project, which continues running on minor available resources, is enormous. To maximally benefit from it will require further funding, most likely within a larger scale national or international project with the involvement of national laboratories and industrially related groups (the plans for it are in place). 

1. The results on flat electrodes comprise the basics of the double layer theory in ionic liquids, the structure of which and response to charging underpins the kinetics electron transfer reactions at electrodes with ionic liquids, when the latter replace ordinary electrolytic solutions. Such reactions are crucial steps in electrosyntesis and extraction of metals. Next understanding the laws of ion layering near electrodes is instrumental for understanding friction. Exploitation of these results are seen in (i) developing the theory of electrochemical kinetics in relation to overscreening effects and lattice saturation, which may dramatically change the current voltage plots for slow electron transfer (redox) reactions at such electrodes; (ii) in systematic experimental testing of the predictions of our theortical results on quantized and electrotneable friction with ionic liquids, already started in the group of S. Perkin in Oxford University (once verified they can be used in developing new scenarios of super-lubricity that can be tuned on and off by applied voltage)

2. Results for the electrical response of ionic liquids in nanoconfinement lay the basis of understanding of functioning ultrananoporous supercapacitors. 

- Whereas a number of these results have rationalized the existing experiments and some (such as investigation of optimal pore size and the role of pore size distribution) has triggered experiments that showed results in agreement with the theory, systematic experimental study of voltages dependence in nanoporous electrodes with a given geometry of the pore is still lacking. Such experiments with well defined monodispersed pores should be performed, and they expect to show the dramatic voltage dependence of capacitance, as predicted by the theory. 

- Whereas, the ultra narrow nanopores have been described by the developed theory, as well as an opposite limit of semi-infinite flat electrodes, the intermediate size pores require different analysis. Three groups in US, inspired by our findings have studied them using different methods, exploring the size dependence, but voltage dependence has not been studied. This is to be the next task on the agenda, as such pores, although they do not deliver the highest capacitance, are also often present in nanoporous electrodes. The achieved results pave the way to such studies. 

- The results for single file models can and should be extended to the case of different sizes of ions, their charge asymmetry and anisotropic shape; this should include also different propensity for cations and anions to occupy the uncharged pore. In the first most simple versions of the theory we have already done this (the results are submitted for publication but are not published yet). 

- Both single-file and narrow slit-pore results has shown that the capacitance should depend dramatically on the propensity of ions to settle in the initially nonpolarized pores. This gives strong motivation to experimentalists to determine this propensity. Such experiments are in progress in Prof. Claire Grey group in Cambridge and Prof. Yuri Gogotsi at Drexel. 

3. Our predictions of the dramatic difference in the statics and dynamics of charging of ionophilic and ionophobic pores demand both the determination of iophilicity /ionophobicity of pores (c.f.Clair Grey's experiments) and experimental verification of the modes of charging. This will be the immediate exploitation of the obtained results.

4. Our theory of the static and dynamic bending modes of ionic-liquid- based electroactuators driven by applied voltage is a pure challenge for experimental groups. There is a broad set of predictions in our two published papers, related in the first place to the size and chemical nature of mobile ions that all ask to be experimentally tested and if verified can be recommended for optimizing the performance of electractutors. Reduction of their multiple characteristics to three dimensionless parameters, can navigate the design of electroactuators. 

The theory, however, has been developed for flat electrodes. Nevertheless, it gives a platform and a reference frame for extending it to nanostructures electrodes.

 5. The first results on the non-ideally metallic response may be put into basis of developing of a more sophisticated theory, approximate analytical or based on electron density functional theory.

6. Having considered the electroactuators to be able to swell, we next have explored some effects of swelling insupercapacitors (the 'unwanted' electroactuation). The latter do experience internal stresses and strain that are experimentally measurable. This phenomenon is important to understand as it has a damaging effect on supercapacitors. Our results were in good agreement with the first results of Volker Presser group at the University of Saarbruecken, and will be continued test in his group.

Many of our results and predictions we made on the basis of simple, generic models; this was done deliberately to reveal the basic physics behind the found effects. They were pioneering and followed by a number of more sophisticated computer simulations, based on more realistic force field of interactions between ions and electrodes. And many of our finding has already been reproduced (c.f. works of M. Sallane and B. Rothenberg in Paris, Watamanu and Bedrov in Utah, etc.), we continue to lead in exploring the unknown territories in this area with many followers (which is documented by the high and immediate impact of the most of our publications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0394E492-7370-4AAF-A7DC-2B67DD92BB3D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/DA83C872-174F-4D1C-A29B-21707309DD36"><gtr:id>DA83C872-174F-4D1C-A29B-21707309DD36</gtr:id><gtr:title>Erratum: Double Layer in Ionic Liquids: Overscreening versus Crowding [Phys.
