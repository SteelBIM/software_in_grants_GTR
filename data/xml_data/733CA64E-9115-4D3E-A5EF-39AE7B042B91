This allows us to analyse the DNA from the collection of microorganisms that inhabit the environment, many of which may not have previously been sequenced due to their fastidious nature, making it difficult to culture them in the laboratory. Substantial amounts of sequencing data are produced, which typically only reflect a small fraction of the total DNA. However, after analysis, this DNA provides clues to the taxonomic diversity and functional potential that is found in that environment. 

Metagenomics is an exemplar of what is referred to as data-driven biology. The cost of DNA sequencing has fallen rapidly, such that most research groups have access to affordable institutional sequencing facilities. We now run the risk of each research group producing its own metagenomics analysis platform and storage repository. To help prevent such a fragmented situation, and to help reduce overall costs (both computational and staff), we have developed and implemented a centralised pipeline to provide a metagenomics data analysis and archiving platform. 

The EBI Metagenomics Portal (EBI-MP) has been developed as a collaborative UK effort at the EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI). The portal was launched in 2011 and has increasingly become established as a world leader in metagenomic analysis. Users submit their high-throughput metagenomic nucleotide sequence data, accompanied by contextual data describing their samples and experiments in a controlled and consistent manner. Once analysed by the portal, results including taxonomic and functional annotations can be visualised alongside project and sample descriptions, and can be downloaded for further analysis. 

In order to keep up with community needs, and to help cement the UK's position as a leader in the field of metagenomics research, the proposed project aims to further develop the portal. This will include the addition of analysis provenance, to ensure that analyses can be re-run in the future as new and updated tools and algorithms become available, without overwriting existing analysed data, which may form the basis of an existing publication. Further enhancements include extending the taxonomic and functional analyses to achieve a better picture of the microbial communities sampled, their composition and biological functions. The portal will also be developed to allow more sophisticated searches of its data, so that users can discover samples or environments based on the kind of microbe or protein function found there. We will also add the ability to perform statistically rigorous cross-sample comparisons, that will allow analysis results from different samples to be compared in a scientifically meaningful way, and provide visualisation tools for such comparisons. With today's modern sequencing technologies producing ever more data, better data compression is essential to speed up data transfer both into EBI-MP and internally within the resource. To this end, we will implement industry-standard compression data structures that have developed at EMBL-EBI.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>EBI-MP is a global portal for the metagenomics research community. Offering data submission, archiving and sharing functions, community standards-compliant curation, and functional and taxonomic diversity analyses, the service has attracted a growing user-base of UK, European and global researchers.

We intend to improve the pipeline infrastructure to offer analysis provenance by modularising pipeline components, defining a dependency tree between modules, and module versioning. Subsequently, we will perform updates to reference databases and analysis software, and make results reanalysis with the updated pipeline actionable for our users. We will improve the range of taxonomic annotations provided by the resource, moving beyond 16S rRNA-based analyses. We will also investigate the application of the UniPept approach to taxonomic classification for metagenomic datasets. We will add pathway information to the functional annotation provided by EBI-MP, using the latest version of InterProScan to provide KEGG, MetaCyc and UniPathway links, and develop a tool to visualise the catalytic potential of a sample, highlighting reactions where there is support for the existence of constituent proteins.

We will implement CRAM compressed sequence data formats within the system to increase the speed of upload of data to EBI-MP and to facilitate internal processing and storage. We will also design and build data discovery tools that provide a full range of search functions across the sample, contextual and analysis data, and provide these tools as web services and via the website. Finally, we will develop mathematically sound methods to estimate depth of sequencing required to capture a specific fraction of diversity, and to normalise samples so that they can be compared in statistically meaningful ways. These analyses will be provided from the website, along with visualisation tools capable of producing heatmaps and PCA plots for sample comparison.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>The use of metagenomics is widespread, with its application in such diverse fields as agriculture, food manufacture, the elucidation of antibiotic resistance mechanisms, bioenergy, and animal/human health. The EBI Metagenomics Portal (EBI-MP) covers data submission, archiving and sharing functions, community standards-compliant curation, and rich functional and taxonomic diversity analyses. Launched in 2011, the resource has become a world leader in metagenomics data analysis, attracting a growing userbase across the UK, European and global communities. The impact on academic research is already in effect, with the EBI-MP providing both a robust analysis platform and access to a large compute resource. Both of these features are often lacking within academia. Thus, the EBI-MP is making metagenomics analysis available to more researchers, and relieves a significant bottleneck between data and interpretation. One vital impact of the project will be continued support for archiving and analysis of metagenomic data in the face of ever increasing data volumes. The proposed work provides a number of mechanisms, including adoption of CRAM-based data compression technology and a tightly controlled way of updating analysis algorithms, by which the pipeline can be made more efficient, with higher throughput and the ability to scale. Improved sample analyses, through updated reference databases and extended taxonomic and functional analyses, are also critical, since they will increase the usefulness of EBI-MP to researchers and better meet the community's needs. These benefits will be felt in the short term, and will also persist into the longer term, as updates and improvements are made throughout the course of the project. In the medium term, these developments will allow the EBI-MP to grow with increasing demand, without significantly increasing the computational overhead. This will be achieved by the incorporation of more efficient algorithms, thereby increasing throughput. Updating the reference database will facilitate a more in-depth functional and taxonomic analysis, as more diverse organisms are represented in them. The infrastructural changes to the pipeline will also allow other tools to be more easily incorporated into the analysis platform, not only providing scientific exposure to the tool developer, but also enriching the analysis results. Our objective of improving data discoverability, by linking from other databases to the EBI-MP, will allow metagenomics results to reach a broad life science community, where individuals may be unaware of the data. It is important to note that, in this project, we are also establishing a new collaboration with Newcastle University that builds on our cross-scientific discipline culture. This will expose the existing EBI-MP team to novel approaches and scientific challenges. At the same time, from these collaborations, we aim to produce statistical protocols to provide additional confidence and information about the data. Cross-sample analyses will inevitably provide researchers with a significantly deeper understanding of complex communities. In the medium and longer term, the knowledge gained from understanding complex communities will have significant impacts for the UK. Impacts include the economic, from efficiency-enhanced industrial enzymes, through improved soil conditions providing greater crop yields, to healthcare solutions by comparing diseased and healthy states. One of the key areas will be the translation of metagenomics to industry. Through our industrial links at EMBL-EBI and Newcastle University, we will engage with this sector, to establish requirements. To ensure our users are able to utilise the new features we will provide online training material, publish in scientific and non-scientific literature, attend meetings and conferences aimed at a range of audiences and run training workshops, to maximize dissemination into the academic, industrial and 3rd-party communities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-01-20</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-01-21</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>646069</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>ComMet - Metagenomics community engaguement</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>17BA7E78-DA8B-48A7-A3BE-0DD02ABE4414</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Series of activities including engagement with industry (Microbiomes and Metagenomes), running workshop (3 day training course) and providing support for community.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://metagenomics.uk/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metagenomics workshop - HBio 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5139645C-5F30-4061-A835-6032ECA65FF4</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation on EBI Metagenomics given at workshop as part of HBio 2016 (Hellenic Biosciences conference)</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Simultaneous analysis of eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses in marine metagenomic data</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A51E2F94-74B5-4A33-9B58-3659D6135F2F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation at a European microeukaryote conference, outlining the tools we have developed to analyse metagenomic datasets.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metagenomics: from bench to data analysis 2016 - Earlham institute, Norwich</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EEA6D680-AB44-4561-AC3E-78C6B54FFA4C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Hands on course describing how EBI Metagenomics can be used to analyse and explore data.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Metagenomics bioinformatics training course - EBI</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AA2E9B1D-B958-4981-858C-3C69AD3567A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>3 day training course providing training in metagenomics data analysis aimed at early stage researchers with international speakers; largely hands-on with lots of interaction and discussion.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/events/2016/metagenomics-bioinformatics-1</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Micro B3 OSD Analysis Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F2E603CF-DABF-4E12-AE72-F3DC33EFB87F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop that provided end users with accessed to their analyses data as part of the Ocean Sampling Day project.

We now house the largest collection of processed metagenomic material in the world, and have increase discoverability of the data through a simple faceted search interface, which is underpinned by a complex search infrastructure and index of our huge volume of results.

The EMG data resource is provided openly and freely to users and is globally unique in three respects. First, its analysis methods draw on the InterPro protein sequence analysis platform, itself drawing upon other EMBL-EBI resources - Pfam (Protein Family database). The consistencies of analysis between multiple datasets allow for comparisons across different projects. Second, through tight integration with the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), EMG serves as the database of permanent record for metagenomics datasets. Third, reporting standards are deeply integrated into its services, driving the highest discoverability and utility of data within the metagenomics domain.
 
The EMG project (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/) was conceived in 2011 and construction on the EMG analysis pipeline and website began in January 2012, with the commitment of staffing from EMBL and from the BBSRC. Launched in 2012, it reached maturity and was released in full production in September 2013. The EMG website provides the focal point for the resource and offers simple navigation into the functions on offer, including browsing of analysis results and submission of new data into the system. Now, due to increasing numbers of datasets and driven by user feedback, we have refactored some of the initial website design/features to make EMG more user-friendly and streamlined. The homepage has been redeveloped to highlight that the EMG is not only an analysis platform, but also a place for browsing and discovering data. 

Over the reporting period, content in the resource has grown substantially. The largest individual driver of growth has been the Tara Oceans marine project, but even if this is removed from the analysis, growth has still been significant. EMG now holds publicly available analyses from over 82,000 runs, corresponding to over 58,000 samples from 944 different projects. A further 4000 runs (3623 samples) from 148 projects are held within the system under pre-publication embargo, requested by the data provider. Result sets available across EMG content include taxonomic and functional analyses, each provided with corresponding visualisations and downloadable files. While the type of analysis remains largely unchanged, a major refactoring of the pipeline has enabled upgrades to underlying reference libraries, thereby enriching the analysis results. For example, an update to the GreenGenes database has enabled finer-grained taxonomic assignments to be made, when analysis of the same run using the different versions of the pipeline are compared. We have also seen continued uptake of the service, with both an increased provider user base and in the number of web users and hits (40% and 33%, respectively, between September 2014 and 2015). Since then, update has further increased by &amp;gt;100% due to new developments on the website. 

Without doubt, one of the key highlights has been the deposition and analysis of two high profile oceanographic studies: Ocean Sampling Day (OSD) and Tara Oceans. OSD (https://www.microb3.eu/osd) is a simultaneous sampling for marine microorganisms in a global network across all continents (http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/4/1/27). Marine microorganisms have been collected according to standardised sampling protocols during the Solstice on June 21st in 2014 and 2015. Richly and consistently described samples from the study are publicly available from the ENA (study accession PRJEB5129), together with primary amplicon and shotgun metagenomic data from the 2014 sampling (PRJEB8682) and derived data processed by the EBI Metagenomics (PRJEB9694).
 
Tara Oceans (http://goo.gl/Y8yNK1) is a project to map the biodiversity of a wide range of planktonic organisms and their interactions with the surrounding environment as part of at 2009-2013 expedition on board the schooner Tara. Representing the largest DNA sequencing initiative yet delivered in ocean science, it comprises primary sequence data of more than 7,000 highly contextualised samples (PRJEB402), as well as derived data of the metagenomics pan-gene analysis (PRJEB7988).

EMG has provided analysis for the metagenomic component of Ocean Sampling Day data collected in 2014 (EMG project accession ERP009703) and the Global Ocean microbiome subset of the Tara Oceans project, which contains metagenomic sequences, size fractionated for prokaryotes (ERP001736). Whilst roughly equivalent in sample size (150 and 135 samples, respectively), the two projects differ substantially in the amount of sequencing data, with the subset of OSD analysed comprising ~120 Gb in total data size (~ 220 million sequences), and the Tara Oceans subset representing approximately 10 Tb of sequence data (~29 billion sequences).

The EMG analysis predicted approximately 200 million protein coding sequences for the OSD 2014 project, 68 million of which were annotated with matches to InterPro. For Tara Oceans, over 23 billion protein coding sequences were predicted, over 9 billion of which received InterPro annotation. These data are now all available online and, due to the consistent analysis used, can be downloaded and compared to each other. We have already started to receive user requests asking if their data can be (re-)analysed and compared to the Tara results. We expect the Tara Oceans data (both sequence and analysis results) to become a major marine gold standard dataset that is used for years to come.

The analysis of both datasets was only made possible by a complete overhaul of the analysis pipeline, which was a key milestone of this grant. We have also add a number of additional major projects to the database, including the American Gut and the TwinsUK.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The marine datasets have been will act as a long term record form monitoring the health of the World's Oceans.
