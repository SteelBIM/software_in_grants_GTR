Criminal Justice Responses</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/J008109/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>This two-year study will examine the experiences and expectations of those who are victimised because of their identity, vulnerability or perceived 'difference' in the eyes of the perpetrator. By exploring hate crime in a broader sense of 'targeted victimisation', the project aims to investigate the experiences of the more ?recognised? hate crime victim communities, including those who experience racist, religiously motivated, homophobic, disablist and transphobic victimisation, as well as those who are marginalised from existing hate crime scholarly and policy frameworks. The study will also investigate respondents? perceptions of criminal justice agencies and other service providers in order to assess the needs of victims and to identify lessons for effective service delivery.&lt;br />&lt;br />The site for the research is Leicester, one of the most plural cities in the UK containing a diverse range of communities whose views will be accessed for this study. The research team will administer online and written surveys to victims of hate crime within these communities as well as undertake in-depth interviews to probe issues in greater depth. Regular updates on their progress will also be provided via a dedicated project website and through social networking media to establish a sense of accessibility and transparency.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research? 

The research proposal has the potential to benefit service users, vulnerable communities, academics and criminal justice policymakers and practitioners, including: 
1. Potential and actual victims of hate crime
2. Community groups, networks and associations 
3. The police service
4. Crown Prosecution Service 
5. Local authorities 
6. Victim Support
7. Ministry of Justice and Home Office 
8. Charities and third sector organisations 

How will they benefit from this research? 

Achieving the aims and objectives will deliver a series of practical benefits. At one level, the research will involve community groups, networks and associations from the outset, ensuring that they are fully consulted throughout every stage of the research process and engaged in the dissemination of findings. Moreover, the study will contribute to debates about the scope and effectiveness of existing hate crime policies, and this will enable policymakers and practitioners to identify ways of tailoring services to meet the expectations of victims who require their support. Equally, it will help these organisations to develop responses to victimisation that are based upon the actual needs of victims, rather than assumptions about who their service users are and what their needs might be. At a broader level, the research will generate significant new data that will inform regional and national policy and practice. It has the capacity to make an important contribution to debates about the nature and impact of hate crime, the legitimacy and effectiveness of criminal justice policy, the use of engagement strategies with 'hard-to-reach' communities, and responses to victims of hate crime.

How will we provide opportunities to engage with the research?

The proposers have already established contact with gatekeepers and facilitators to each of the communities that will be involved in the research, and a representative cross-section will form a community working group which will be consulted at regular intervals. This will provide an important community interface to inform the research. The proposers have also secured the support of personnel from key local agencies, including the police, Victim Support and local authorities, who will form the project steering group and will help to maximise the policy impact of the research. Senior ACPO and Ministry of Justice leads on hate crime will also have an input. Other means for generating impact include:

1. A project website, which will be active throughout the study in order to publicise the research to the wider communities of Leicester and to promote ways of accessing support to potential and actual victims of targeted violence.
2. A plain English report summarising the research findings for non-academic users.
3. Translated copies of the report for intended beneficiaries of the research whose preference would be to receive a non-English language version.
4. Launching the findings at a national two-day conference (at the University of Leicester), which will devote separate days to considering the implications of the research for scholarship and for policy. National policy leads from the statutory and voluntary sectors will play a key role at this event.
5. Working with steering group members and senior national hate crime policymakers at a post-project workshop to develop an action plan to implement the research's recommendations.
6. Presenting the findings at four relevant academic and practitioner conferences.
7. Submitting articles based on the research to local media, community newsletters, relevant websites, practice-oriented academic journals such as 'Policing and Society', the 'British Journal of Community Justice', 'Criminology and Criminal Justice' and the 'British Journal of Criminology', and to magazines such as 'Criminal Justice Matters' and 'Police Review'.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-10-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-10</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>295091</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The research team have been working with an animation company in Leicester to produce a short 3 minute animation designed to make people think about what they could do to challenge hate within their everyday life.

Feedback from these organisations suggests that the film is being shown in schools, colleges, youth groups, prisons, charities and faith groups to young people and adults from a range of different backgrounds. 

On 30 October 2014 'The Harms of Hate' won the Royal Television Award for 'Best Factual Programme' at the Royal Television Society Midlands Awards (as noted in the 'Awards and Recognition' section). The Best Factual Programme category contained 11 nominations, the highest number of all award categories. 

More recently, the film won the General In-House Award and the Special Jury Award at the British Universities Film and Video Council's Learning on Screen Awards. To date, the film has been viewed more than 5,700 times of YouTube.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>A Short Film - 'The Harms of Hate'</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCFJd2U2BNQ</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Leicester County Council</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Steering Group Partnership</gtr:description><gtr:id>9FAC413A-14D4-4BD1-9889-042F5E074C1E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>As a result of the steering group activity, Neil Chakraborti was invited to be part of the Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust 'Hate Crime and Health' Working Group.

Furthermore, the research team were subsequently invited back to the Dawn Centre on multiple occasions due to the number of service users who wished to take part in the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Guest lecture at the University of East London's Seminar Series (London)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>51599C59-DCF4-4046-9939-F9C5D49BEA25</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Neil Chakraborti was invited to deliver a guest lecture at the University of East London's Seminar Series, which was attended by more than 30 students, academics, practitioners and members of the public.

Over the past year the economic and social impact of our work has become more apparent, and has made a significant contribution in the following ways:

1) Increasing public awareness of hate crime and engagement with research

Our findings have raised awareness of the different forms that hate crime can take and the range of groups and communities who fall victim to hate crime. During the life of the project we engaged with more than 4,000 people from some of the more established and emerging minority groups in Leicester to raise awareness of what hate crimes are and how to access support. This will make a difference to levels of understanding and reporting amongst some of the city's most disadvantaged and vulnerable communities. We also worked with a total of 120 statutory, voluntary and community-based organisations and networks to ensure that hate crime issues are afforded sufficient priority. 

Awareness has also been raised through the completion of 55 media engagements during the life of the project and a further 60 media engagements thus far on completion of the project. These include features on national and local radio, television, newspapers and online blog sites, with a combined reach of ****. We have also used social media platforms to engage audiences in the research, including through a dedicated Twitter profile which has more than 1,000 followers. 

Finally, we have produced a short film entitled 'The Harms of Hate' based on the project findings. More than 350 DVD copies of the film were distributed to regional, national and international statutory and voluntary organisations, and the film has also received over 4,600 views on YouTube. It has been used by schools, colleges, youth groups, prisons, charities and faith groups to showcase key messages from the project. This film won the award of Best Factual Programme at the Royal Television Society Midlands Awards 2014, as well as the General In-House Award and the Special Jury Award at the British Universities Film and Video Council's Learning on Screen Awards 2015.

2) Influencing public policies to enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of public services

Our findings have influenced change and good practice in the context of responding to the needs of hate crime victims. From the outset our research was designed to help organisations across different sectors to develop evidence-based, cost-effective policy responses. We have shared our findings and recommendations (through the production of eight reports and briefing papers) with over 400 statutory and voluntary organisations who run services for people affected by hate crime locally, regionally and nationally. This includes police forces and other criminal justice and victim support agencies; health and social care providers; and some of the more tailored community support services including neighbourhood centres, international colleges, race equality groups, LGBT centres, and support groups for asylum seekers and refugees, the homeless, people with physical/learning disabilities and mental ill health.

In addition, we created a Victims' Manifesto in order to secure commitment to the project recommendations from key stakeholders, local community groups, associations and networks. Thus far 75 national and regional organisations have pledged to incorporate these recommendations into their policies and strategies through their 'on the record' commitment to the Victims' Manifesto. We have also been commissioned as consultants for more than 20 organisations, including Hertfordshire Police, Just Lincolnshire, Leicestershire Police, Nottingham City Council, and West Midlands Police. Our work with these organisations focused on making improvements to their existing policies and practices which has led to the production of more effective awareness-raising campaigns, the creation of new third-party reporting structures, the development of more tailored support services for hate crime victims. 

3) Enhancing the knowledge and skills of public, private and third-sector organisations

We have used our empirical evidence to design and deliver continuing professional development (CPD) workshops and bespoke training packages for frontline practitioners and policy-makers. This training aims to enhance knowledge of the nature, extent and impact of hate crime; to highlight the differences in needs and perceptions across different groups of victims; to improve practitioners' skills and understanding of how best to support victims and those at risk of hate crime; and to provide best practice guidance which enables professionals to develop sustainable methods of engagement with diverse and 'hard to reach' communities. 

Thus far we have delivered ten CPD workshops at the University of Leicester and a further 15 bespoke training session at different organisations across the country, reaching more than 500 public- and third-sector professionals in the process from different sectors including criminal justice, education, welfare and health/social care. Formal evaluation feedback has demonstrated that these workshops are helping frontline practitioners and policy-makers to develop a greater knowledge of hate crime and more effective skills in supporting victims, with 100% of delegates at each workshop rating the training as 'Good' or 'Very Good' and the same proportion stating that the workshops will be of benefit to them individually within their professional roles and to their organisations. Moreover, feedback from our three monthly follow-up evaluations shows that delegates feel more competent in responding to hate crime and more equipped to offer specialist support to hate crime victims as a result of our training. A further 10 workshops have been planned for 2016, thereby ensuring that the findings from our ESRC-funded research continue to shape policy and practice in the longer-term.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>75EB959E-ED4C-4AFB-9278-35DAB9483778</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The evidence from this project is based on research conducted with the largest and most diverse sample of hate crime victims ever identified in a single study. Over the course of two years the research team engaged with more than 4,000 people from different backgrounds and communities, and the sample of hate crime victims included nearly 1,500 people who had been subjected to acts of violence, hostility and intimidation because of their identity or 'difference'. The research has generated new knowledge in four key areas:

1) The nature and impact of hate crime victimisation

The research illustrated that hate crimes were a routine, and mostly unreported feature of many people's daily lives. This includes people who are targeted specifically because of their race, religion, sexual orientation, disability or their gender identity, as well as those who belong to the kinds of more marginalised groups so often overlooked within research and policy such as Gypsies and Travellers, the homeless, new migrant communities and those who live alternative lifestyles.
These offences took a range of different forms, including physical violence, cyberbullying, damage to property and sexually violent hate crime such as rape or sexual assault. All forms of hate crime had a significant impact upon victims' emotional and physical health, with particularly high numbers of victims of disablist and transphobic hate referring to feeling vulnerable, depressed or suicidal. 

2) The profile of hate crime perpetrators

Hate crime perpetrators are often assumed to be complete strangers to their victims, and more often than not far-right sympathisers or extremists. However, in fewer than half of cases within this research was the offender unknown to the victim, meaning that more often than not the person perpetrating hate was someone familiar: a neighbour, a work colleague, a carer, a 'friend' or even a family member.


3) Victims' expectations in relation to justice
There is often an assumption that victims of crime demand punitive responses to offending behaviour. This research, however, has challenged that assumption, with participants showing an overwhelming preference for the use of educational interventions and restorative approaches to justice, as opposed to extended prison sentences or harsher regimes. Moreover, this preference was shared by victims of different types of violent and non-violent hate crime and from different communities, ages and backgrounds. 

4) Implications for criminal justice agencies and other service providers

The research highlighted victims' lack of familiarity with the term 'hate crime' and their lack of awareness of how to access support services. It revealed that hate crime awareness campaigns are failing to resonate with people at a grassroots level, and especially those from smaller and emerging minority communities and from economically disadvantaged environments. The research also illustrated how few victims had reported experiences of hate crime to the police, and to other networks, organisations or individuals in a position of authority and trust. In addition to assessing barriers to reporting, the research identified ways of making reporting more accessible, reducing feelings of isolation and vulnerability, and meeting the needs of diverse 'hard-to-reach' communities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The research team produced a total of eight reports, including a Full Findings and Recommendations report; an Executive Summary; a series of themed briefing papers on Disablist Hate Crime, Gendered Hostility, Homophobic Hate Crime, Racist Hate Crime, and Religiously Motivated Hate Crime; and a Victims' Manifesto containing a 10-point plan outlining practical ways to support victims more effectively. These reports have been published in hard copy and online, and distributed to more than 300 organisations and networks across the criminal justice, local authority, education, health and third sectors.

The Victims' Manifesto enables practitioners and policy-makers to pledge support to the recommendations embodied within the 10-point plan put forward by the research team. To date, more than 75 public, private and third-organisations across the UK and Europe have pledged to incorporate the recommendations provided within the Victims' Manifesto into their existing and future policies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>62289184-DF3E-4501-9EFA-EE4101BB60FF</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/hate/project/our-reports</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited to submit evidence to the House of Commons Select Committee inquiry into hate crime and its violent consequences</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E4E416BD-A696-464E-B0FB-8A97BF402EC8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/home-affairs-committee/inquiries/parliament-2015/inquiry7/</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Professional development workshop delivered to practitioners working in the field of LGBT hate crime</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7413FD10-8F68-4E43-85A8-72272FED5C97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop helped to identify the types of policy and practice that help to improve the quality of service offered to victims of homophobic and transphobic hate crime.

To date, the research team have delivered approximately 15 workshops and training sessions. These have been attended by more than 100 policy-makers and professionals from the Crown Prosecution Service, Police, NHS and local authorities, as well as other organisations. Feedback from delegates demonstrated that they had developed a greater understanding of hate crime and more effective skills in supporting victims: 
? 100% of delegates have rated our workshops as 'Good' or 'Very Good'.
? 100% of delegates have stated that attending our workshops will benefit them within their professional roles.
? 100% of delegates have stated that attending our workshops will significantly benefit their organisation. 

Three month follow-up communication with delegates suggests that they now feel more competent in responding to hate crime and more equipped to offer specialist support to hate crime victims. The research team continue to deliver CPD workshops and bespoke training packages to frontline practitioners and policy-makers.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/criminology/hate/professional/cpd-workshops</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participation in an advisory committee led by Stop Hate UK</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AF160481-9A20-4C45-BC30-A1302BBCED69</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The research team was invited to form part of an advisory committee focusing on the victimisation of people belonging to alternative subcultures.

They also delivered multiple keynote speeches, guest lectures and research lunches at local, national and international universities. 

As a result of these engagements researchers, academics and practitioners developed a greater awareness of the nature, extent and impact of hate crime, a greater understanding of associated research methods and an enhanced knowledge of new ways of improving policy and practice. In summary, the audiences developed new knowledge and skills which could be applied within their own field of work or research.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invited to submit evidence to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) inspection of police responses to hate crime</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>33AB9474-F0A0-410B-9B8F-03DFC904A94B</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmic/wp-content/uploads/hmic-inspection-programme-consultation-2017-2018.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Citation in the Review of Under-Reporting in Shropshire (Shropshire)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C724211-1749-48FD-94D6-7EFABC5D2415</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fairness, Respect, Equality Shropshire Ltd (FREsh) undertook a scoping exercise to understand the barriers and challenges that victims face when reporting hate crimes. The findings from the Leicester Hate Crime Project were cited throughout the report and specifically, the recommendations were referred to.

It is anticipated that the findings from the Leicester Hate Crime Project, as cited in the report, will be used to improve accessibility of public services and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public services. However, due to the report having only been published in January 2016, this impact has not been actualised yet.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to give evidence to House of Commons Select Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A6A94DB9-05FE-4B5E-AA15-E853ADD3E5DE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Professor Neil Chakraborti was invited to present expert evidence to a House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee as part of an inquiry into transgender equality.

This may be because these teams have tried to access them via 'traditional' methods such as utilising community leaders or those community 'representatives' that are routinely used by criminal justice agencies. This strategy can mean that the 'usual' voices are heard and that those of 'ordinary' members of the public are lost. To navigate around this problem, this project employed a 'softer', more subtle approach to locating and engaging with a wide range of diverse communities. This approach involved the research team spending prolonged periods of time in public spaces and buildings across the city, including international supermarkets, cafes and restaurants, charity shops, community and neighbourhood centres, libraries, health centres, places of worship, pubs and clubs, taxi ranks, and shelters and drug and alcohol services that support 'hard to reach' groups. Adopting this method enabled us to engage with over 4,000 members of established and emerging communities in order to raise awareness of the project itself, and to promote further recognition of the harms of hate and available pathways of support for victims.</gtr:description><gtr:id>57A835B4-EF60-4BBC-9DF0-46B27B7E35FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This method enabled the research team to engage with over 4,000 members of established and emerging minority communities in order to raise awareness of the project itself, which resulted in over 1,300 people from traditionally 'hard-to-reach' communities participating in the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>'Soft Approach' to Accessing 'Hard-to-Reach' Communities</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The Lead Researcher kept a field-note diary throughout the research process.
