Are certain types of schools or schools with certain characteristics more successful than others and why? Do some types of school suit some pupils better than others? To what extent is schooling implicated in social and&amp;nbsp;educational inequalities in Britain? In a time of increasing school diversity, selectivity and marketisation, these questions are more salient than ever.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The 1970 British Cohort Study should be a prime data source for addressing these and related questions. This dataset provides a rich range of family background and ability measures, providing a substantial advantage in dealing with the issue of selectivity into the different types of school. However, work using the 1970 cohort has previously been hampered by the absence of secondary school data for the majority of the cohort members.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project will repair the 1986 schooling data using a range of sources, and will also retrieve and deposit new cognitive scores from 1986. The project will use the newly enhanced data to conduct a programme of multidisciplinary research addressing the short and long term consequences of different school contexts.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>We will engage research users through publishing non-technical papers and reports, through regular updates and news on the project's website, through engaging with the media, and through running workshops. We will draw on the expertise of our advisory panel (see Pathways to Impact) for assistance in how best to reach these groups.

1. The research has potential to increase the effectiveness of public policy on education and social mobility, by providing a stronger evidence base for policy. We expect the research to benefit UK government departments (especially, but not limited to, the Department for Education), government departments in the devolved administrations, and not for profit organisations such as think tanks working in this area (for example the Sutton Trust, IPPR, Demos). Public policy regarding aspects of schooling such as private schools, selective schools, faith schools and single-sex schools has often been made on a primarily ideological rather than evidence-based basis. This research will seek to challenge conventional thinking in this area, whether on the left or the right, where the evidence justifies this.

2. The research will also inform parents, teachers and the general public about the impacts of attending particular types of school for particular categories of pupil. We will increase awareness of the role of socio-economic inequalities in producing educational inequalities, and the aspects of schooling which may exacerbate or protect against increasingly unequal cognitive, educational, social and occupational outcomes during schooling and beyond.

3. Project staff and the project student will develop both professional and research skills, including high-level quantitative skills, and skills in communicating quantitative analyses to general audiences. These skills are in shortage both in UK academia and in the wider economy.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-07-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>298631</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Universities UK</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>UUK Project: Do the mid-career benefits of higher education vary among students from different socio-economic backgrounds?</gtr:description><gtr:id>93BB5A64-CABB-4277-9376-F2E2B40D5A07</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Working paper (not yet released)</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Input into research questions and dissemination.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Consultancy project for UUK as a spin-off from the main ESRC project.
Research questions:
The main RQs examined surround the long-term influence of early socio-economic advantage on labour market outcomes in mid-adulthood (at age 42), controlling for degree attainment, and whether the value of gaining a degree from an elite university for labour market success varies by socio-economic background. Specifically:
? Does attendance at a private secondary school influence pay at age 42, even after controlling for degree attainment and university status? 
? Do those students previously educated in private secondary schools (or with other indicators of prior social advantage) gain a higher economic return from their degree, controlling for university status and achievements?</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Contribution to POST (Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology) briefing 'Academic Evidence on Selective Secondary Schooling' http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/POST-PB-0022</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A5E2C53E-D338-407B-B4DD-1E9F579E5563</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In September 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the Government intends to remove the ban on opening entirely new state-funded grammar schools in England, and to allow non-selective schools to convert under certain circumstances.

Raising state school children's aspirations, self-confidence, and improving their access to social networks would do little to counter the huge pay advantages enjoyed by their privately-educated peers, new research shows.

This press release was based on research using the 1970 British Cohort Study.

1. We have completed our first aim of reapiring the BCS70 1986 school data via both retrospective and administrative information, and inputting previously unavailable cognitive scores from 1986. These new variables have been publicised via a webinar, as well as via our publications.
2. We have published a paper on secondary school types and access to Russell Group universities. We found a powerful advantage associated with private schooling, especially in the case of gaining an elite degree. The private school advantage is partly explained by better school exam results. However, even comparing people with the same exam results at 16 and 18, respondents who had been to private schools had over double the chance of going to a Russell Group university compared to people who had attended comprehensive schools. However, those who had been to Grammar schools were not advantaged over those at Comprehensives.
3. A second paper focusses on the private school pay premium at age 42, and debunks the idea that this advantage can be accounted for by 'soft skills' or personal characteristics or qualities.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The new/repaired variables deposited will be of great use to other researchers, filling a gap in our knowledge of the trajectories of the 1970 generation.
