A very good example of this is how Scottish tartan was revitalised in the 19th century by the allocation of clan names to particular colour and pattern sequences. Tartan continues to make re-appearances in the fashion market through designers such as Vivien Westwood and Dolce &amp;amp; Gabbana. Another example of cultural revitalisation is how, in the 1950s, the basic twelve bar form of blues music was transformed into rock and roll and thence into rock music. This traditional form of music is continuously revisited and revitalised.

The researchers have been involved in a number of revitalising projects such as: at Leeds Cassidy has worked on a PhD project which examined traditional Korean Bojagi fabrics, used as wrapping materials, and experimented successfully with these to form fashion fabrics; at Lancaster Walker and Evans are working on two PhD projects exploring the role of design in the revitalisation of traditional crafts in Northern Thailand and Turkey.

The authors of this proposal wish to undertake a major study to examine both existing and new case studies and to provide a model to enable future designers to use traditional cultural products, patterns and processes as new, contemporary products, patterns and processes. Apart from journal papers the outcomes will include a book consisting of case studies and an explanation and discussion of the proposed model.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The beneficiaries of this research will be researchers, practitioners, and educators within the design community and producers, suppliers and consumers of culturally relevant designs, products and practices. The following strategies will be used to achieve impacts of the research beyond academia:

- Early engagement of project aims with appropriate stakeholders such as The Crafts Council, Royal Society of Arts (RSA), etc.
- Consultation with design practitioners though networks such as the Design Council, the Design Business Association (DBA), etc
- Dissemination of in progress and final research outputs through a curated public exhibition at the Peter Scott Gallery, Lancaster, UK
- Publication of a book summarising the research undertaken within the project.

The impact upon the beneficiaries of the research is thus: design practitioners will be provided with a framework which will allow them to effectively explore culturally relevant designs, products and practices, and how in turn these might be revitalized using contemporary technologies, processes and communication strategies; consumers will be provided with fresh and exciting designs, products and awareness of processes of cultural relevance; commerce and industry will benefit from the development of commercially sustainable modes of engagement with culturally relevant designs, products and practice.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>607878</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Curious Encounters</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>DCF453EA-DF93-4E05-8046-B499D7EED16B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Amy Twigger Holroyd led a team of researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds in developing and delivering Curious Encounters, an interactive pop-up exhibition at Stanley &amp;amp; Audrey Burton Gallery, University of Leeds. The event enabled the researchers to discuss their research with the general public on a one-to-one basis. The exhibition received excellent feedback from visitors, with comments referring to 'an array of fantastic and diverse subject areas' and praising 'the ability to speak to researchers during an exhibition and to discuss your own ideas.' The feedback also captured the project's impact, with many visitors suggesting that they intended to further explore some of the diverse topics highlighted in the exhibition, including the traditional craft of smocking, which was used to represent the Design Routes research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://publicengagementleeds.wordpress.com/curious-encounters-with-objects-past-present-future/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Walker, S.

The workshop comprised 1) an overview of the Design Routes project including its aims and work to date, 2) group engagement with revitalisation strategies through worksheets and examples of strategies, and 3) a discussion and feedback session. Participants were encouraged to select culturally significant design, product and practice that was meaningful to them (often drawn from their own culture) and use this as a mechanism to explore the veracity of the revitalisation strategies. The workshop in Estonia was hosted by the Estonian Native Crafts Department in the Viljandi Culture Academy at the University of Tartu. 18 students studying Estonian native crafts plus 4 member of staff comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of each revitalisation cluster. Taking a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with, each group considered how they could use these strategies for revitalisation. Key insights included the value that the structure of the taxonomy of revitalisation clusters and strategies provided to the ongoing work of the Viljandi Culture Academy with participants, including staff, noting how this aligned with their approaches, and the potential to use these strategies to revisit many native Estonian crafts. Valuable feedback was gained from the participants across the workshops that helped to i) understand how to effectively articulate the overall concept of revitalisation, ii) refine how individual strategies were described, and iii) how best to collectively communicate these strategies as a prospective tool for revitalisation. This workshop has led to the development of an ongoing research network which it is intended will lead to a Horizon 2020 proposal to the forthcoming 'Societal Challenge 6: Europe in a Changing World - Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies' programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE: Discovery Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne: Words and Object</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3766B80F-6690-4698-AE47-EA319D7C68CD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote: Words and Objects: A perspective on the Future Role of Museums, Designing Futures Debates, Discovery Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 3 November 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2008,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited KEYNOTE at ClickNL 'Drive Festival', Dutch Design Week, Eindhoven, (October 2016), The Netherlands</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>27439A34-5787-4A35-B441-ADFD70D59120</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited keynote at ClickNL 'Drive Festival', Eindhoven (October 2016) which launched a major government funded research programme between industry and academia (ClickNL is the Dutch governments' Creative Industries knowledge and innovation network).

The benefit we found was that by engaging in the process, the participants revealed to themselves (for the first time) the richness and variety of creative activities that were occurring in their locale.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://designroutes.org/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - Iowa State University: Progressive Design Praxis</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4407D5DB-B30A-42B0-9BC6-313E6637798F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The College of Design at Iowa State University invited me to their campus to deliver a keynote address to staff and students, run a workshop and provide input and advice about developing their postgraduate design for sustainability education.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Public Lecture - Design Routes: Revitalisation Through Design</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>273699B0-EB04-40F3-A0A8-84427B3B394D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 80 people attend this professoriate public lecture titled &amp;quot;Design Routes:
Revitalisation Through Design&amp;quot; in the Manchester School of Art ASK: Art Seeks Knowledge lecture series at Manchester Metropolitan University on 18 May 2016. Audience engagement was significant and a number of the audience members requested additional information regarding the project. In addition, academics from other institutions attended which has led to emergent research collaborations. A key factor in the success of the events was the use of examples from fieldwork conducted in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA as this effectively illustrated the theoretical aspects of the research.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.art.mmu.ac.uk/events/2016/ask-martyn-evans/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>M&amp;S Archive talk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3FF212C-38EF-4400-9986-9FEB9FCCDD2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A lunchtime talk at the M&amp;amp;S Archive, Leeds - part of the 'Marks in Time' talk series - focusing on the Design Routes research.

This talk was one of the engagement events that accompanied the DESIGN FOR LIFE exhibition at Brantwood.
At this event, food was served that had been designed by children at the local school after visiting and based on what they had seen at the DESIGN FOR LIFE Exhibition. The food was prepared by the Brantwood Chef.
The talk generated much discussion and a lively debate.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.designforlife.website/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia: : Design Shift</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A8A26B71-4D26-4BCD-AFB4-D008AE531F31</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited Talk: Design Shift: the narrow path to holistic design, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, 29 May 2015.

The workshop comprised 1) an overview of the Design Routes project including its aims and work to date, 2) group engagement with revitalisation strategies through worksheets and examples of strategies, and 3) a discussion and feedback session. Participants were encouraged to select culturally significant design, product and practice that was meaningful to them (often drawn from their own culture) and use this as a mechanism to explore the veracity of the revitalisation strategies. Hosted at the University of Helsinki, 17 undergraduate craft education students plus 3 staff members comprised eight groups who were each provided with strategies and examples from one of the eight revitalisation clusters. Participants applied these strategies to an example of a culturally significant design, product and practice example they were familiar with. Positive feedback was received from participants with results demonstrating how the strategies could be employed to generate novel outcomes that hitherto may not have been considered. Key insights identified the need to refine and simplify strategy descriptions and to provide a breadth of examples to best convey the possibilities of the revitalisation strategies. This workshop has led to an ongoing research network which it is intended will lead to a Horizon 2020 proposal to the forthcoming 'Societal Challenge 6: Europe in a Changing World - Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies' programme.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Postgraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>KEYNOTE - Wollongong  Uni., Australia: Design Practice for Sustainability</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C22F17E-985C-4DF6-8684-782C66AC6FDD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Keynote Talk: Design Practice for Sustainability, University of Wollongong, Australia, 6 Sept. 2016
