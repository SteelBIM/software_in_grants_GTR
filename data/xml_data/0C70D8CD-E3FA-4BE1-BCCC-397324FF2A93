Healthcare</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K009060/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Over the past decade, the government in England has increased the choices available to patients about where they receive care by:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>offering patients a formal choice about where to receive hospital treatment&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>expanding the set of hospitals patients can choose between by allowing privately owned hospitals to treat NHS patients. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This programme of research will examine how increasing patient choice has affected inequalities in the access to and use of the NHS, and the implications for subsequent health outcomes. The research will be organised around three projects:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>Responses to the choice policy by patient type or characteristics. Is there any evidence that some patient groups have benefitted more than others?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Childbirth: &lt;br />

  &lt;ul>
   

   &lt;li>A case of repeated choice, where private providers do not deliver NHS funded care.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li>

   &lt;li>Does choice operate differently when private providers do not enter the market? &lt;/li>

   &lt;li>Do women use their own experiences of childbirth when making decisions about subsequent pregnancies?&lt;/li>

  &lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>The potential effects of future choice reforms on equity. A structural model of patient behaviour will be developed to illustrate the potential effects of potential policies that could affect patient choice.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The 6 main non-academic groups will benefit from my research agenda are as follows:
1.Policy-makers within government
This group includes government and opposition politicians, and civil servants. The results of my research will demonstrate the distributional impact of past policies to increase choice, and simulate the effects of possible policy scenarios. All political parties in the UK claim that they seek to reduce health inequalities. Governments and opposition parties may therefore employ my research to help evaluate past reforms and plan future policy in both healthcare and other public services. 
2.Healthcare market regulators
The healthcare market regulators in England include Monitor and the Cooperation and Competition Panel (CCP). I intend for Monitor to use the results from my research to fulfil its future role in promoting competition and safeguarding the continuity of services. For example, the degree of segmentation by patient type might affect Monitor's judgment on the degree to which providers compete, and whether the premium paid to private providers is justified by higher start up costs. The CCP could invoke my findings when deciding on mergers between healthcare providers. 
3.Individuals and bodies that implement healthcare policy
This group is comprised of healthcare workers, managers and civil servants, including GPs, NHS hospital managers, the new clinical commissioning groups and NHS Commissioning Board, and the Department of Health. For example, the NHS Commissioning Board state that they will seek to &amp;quot;improve outcomes and guarantee no community is left behind or disadvantaged&amp;quot; (NHSCB, 2012). I intend that results of my research will demonstrate how the implementation of policy can affect the distributional impact of a particular reform. These groups may use this evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of previous implementation strategies or to inform the design of future implementation. For example, my findings may indicate that commissioners need to devote more resources to encouraging and supporting choice amongst disadvantaged patients. 
4.Patient advocates
Patient advocates include charities, such as the Patients' Association and Age UK, and MPs. These groups will use my findings in 2 ways. First, to help lobby government on behalf of those they represent. Examples may include a charity requesting more financial and logistical support to help facilitate choice, or an MP campaigning for or against a particular healthcare provider closing, opening or merging within their constituency. Second, to provide direct support and advice to those they represent. Charities may wish to launch information campaigns or support groups; MPs might provide advice to their constituents. 
5.Private healthcare providers
Any observed variation in the willingness or ability of patients to choose private providers could be affected both by the preferences of those providers, or the behaviour of NHS commissioners. Private providers may benefit from widening access and lobby commissioners to recommend their services to patients. Alternatively, new entrants might use my results to calculate an expected rate of return from opening a new centre. It is the job of Monitor to ensure that the behaviour of private providers is of benefit to patients. 
6.Patients and their families
Patients will benefit directly through a greater awareness that they have the right to choose. They benefit indirectly from any improvements in the content and implementation of healthcare policy. 
Whilst the primary beneficiaries in each group will be those in the UK, I believe there is potential for substantive international impact. There are a number of countries with similar healthcare systems, such as Sweden and Denmark, where it would be possible to draw direct comparisons. For other countries, there is an interest in comparing how alternative systems operate and how patients behave when faced with common features, such as new providers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>246545</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Cornell University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Medical Spending in 9 Countries around the developed world</gtr:description><gtr:id>27A012C9-5749-44C7-8F79-0C47B1D33E28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Fiscal Studies Special Issue: Medical Spending around the Developed World September-December 2016</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Eric French from UCL led the project.

2) I spoke with Maternity Commissioners from East London about work on Maternity unit closures that is at an early stage.

These additional patients that were funded by the NHS are not patients who would otherwise have paid for the treatment privately.

I have discovered that the cost of hospital care increases very rapidly after age 50. After age 50, this is entirely attributable to emergency inpatient admissions to hospital. The share of spending accounted for by those in the last year of life is approximately 10%. This is in line with a range of other developed countries.

I have found that those living in deprived areas, ethnic minorities and those with worse underlying health are less likely to choose a privately owned provider when they have an NHS funded hip replacement. Differences by local area deprivation can be explained by a combination of differences in health, proximity to providers, and GP referral patterns. Ethnic minority patients are less likely to choose a privately owned provider, even if they are in the same health, live in the same area, and are treated by the same GP as white patients.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings could be used by the Department of Health, NHS England and commissioners in order to understand how changes in the provision of elective healths services could affect demand for health care.

The finding that emergency hospital care drives the cost of treating older people could be used to target policy efforts to contain health care costs. We also find that although substantial, spending on those in the last year of life explains only a fraction of the growth in overall spending. This highlights the need for a multi-faceted approach to contain health spending. Results from other countries in the study highlight the importance of non-hospital care costs, and in particular the role of social care in the last three years of life.

The finding that certain types of patients have benefitted less from choice policies could be used to share NHS policy in the future. This may include providing more information to GPs or more support to ethnic minority patients.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>21EFE039-34F6-41BF-88CB-89D93EC683BC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AEE02F2B-B7FD-4F15-A41B-41C4260B085A"><gtr:id>AEE02F2B-B7FD-4F15-A41B-41C4260B085A</gtr:id><gtr:title>End-Of-Life Medical Spending In Last Twelve Months Of Life Is Lower Than Previously Reported</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Health Affairs</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/2ab765a01db93ded1326a909101d76e3"><gtr:id>2ab765a01db93ded1326a909101d76e3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>French E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2017-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/7170F4E3-45F1-4D03-B22C-99A1D06A9D3D"><gtr:id>7170F4E3-45F1-4D03-B22C-99A1D06A9D3D</gtr:id><gtr:title>New joints: private providers and rising demand in the English National Health Service</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2"><gtr:id>96ada0b8fe4404202c39487f2350c4c2</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelly E</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/8E68DC67-F718-4E1F-B6E4-927F039CE957"><gtr:id>8E68DC67-F718-4E1F-B6E4-927F039CE957</gtr:id><gtr:title>Poverty dynamics and parental mental health: Determinants of childhood mental health in the UK.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Social science &amp;
