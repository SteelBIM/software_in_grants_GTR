&lt;p>The objective is to study whether, and if so how, the onset of care-dependence in an older household member leads to household impoverishment and vulnerability. Households with an older person who has developed needs for care (incident care households) will be compared with those with older residents with long-standing needs for care (chronic dependence) and no needs for care (control households). Detailed household interviews will be used to assess consumption, income and assets, including changes that might be attributable to the onset or intensification of care-dependence. Detailed case studies of selected households will be used to elucidate the pathways involved. An additional focus is intra-household effects and wider social dynamics:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>How is the care burden for dependent older people distributed across household members and wider kinship networks?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>What factors influence the distribution of the care burden inside and outside the household?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>How are decisions about the allocation of care made and justified?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>To what extent does this depend on the external policy environment, including the reach of social protection and health services?&lt;/li>

All quantitative and qualitative interviews have been completed in China, Mexico and Peru, and the qualitative work has been completed in Nigeria. Data has been analysed and several publications are currently under preparation. Project symposia to disseminate findings have been held/ will be held at the Alzheimer's Disease International annual conference (Puerto Rico, May 2014), International Federation on Ageing (Hyderabad, June 2014), World Federation for Mental Health/ Mental Health for All (Lille, April 2015), International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics (Dublin, April 2015). An edited version of the project film shot in Peru was used by the Department of Health at the UK G7 Dementia Legacy Event to raise awareness of the global impact of the condition.

Methodology developed for the project
The study protocol has been published in an open access online journal (Mayston et al 2014, Springer Online PMC 25105086)
The project questionnaires developed to assess household economic functioning seemed to perform well. Equivalised household income and expenditure/ consumption indicators were highest in China sites, followed by Peru and Mexico. In Latin America, income and expenditure were higher in urban than rural sites, but the opposite was true in China. All distributions were positively skewed, most particularly in China, suggesting higher levels of income inequality. Patterns of correlation between income and expenditure/ consumption varied between sites consistent with expectations regarding rural and urban economies, and the high saving rates in China. The questionnaires will be used in adapted form in a European Union funded network consortium (EMERALD) to assess the impact of increasing coverage of community-based treatment of serious mental disorders in 5 low income countries. We shall also be incorporating these and other selected measures (older adult autonomy and met/ unmet needs) in the next wave of our 10/66 population-based surveys in Latin America and China (2015-19, funded by the European Research Council) to achieve a richer and more detailed assessment of economic status and social protection.

Testing of hypotheses
Controlling for household assets, occupational social class of the index older person and household composition at 10/66 baseline survey, we tested for the possible impact of care dependence among older residents on household impoverishment. 
1. There was evidence for reduced household expenditure and food consumption linked to care needs of older adult residents, particularly when needs for care had been longstanding. There was also moderate evidence for increased economic strain regardless of the duration of care 
2. While there was a trend towards lower equivalised household incomes, particularly in chronic care households, this effect was not statistically significant. The absence of an association did not seem to be explained by higher levels of compensatory income from external sources (gifts from family, and charity). 
3. Household healthcare costs were significantly higher, and catastrophic healthcare spending more likely among care households in some sites (particularly Peru). This association was not apparent in all sites, likely explained by differences in social protection mediated through modes of healthcare financing. 
4. There was a trend towards not working because of the demands of caring for an older household member being considerably more common in incident and chronic care than control households. 
5. Care exit households were defined as those where all older adults needing care (in most cases, all of the older residents) had died. These households were characterised by much lower income from external sources than all other household types, and significantly lower household healthcare costs. This suggested an important impact of the presence of older household members on healthcare costs, and that households with older residents tended to benefit from income from external sources, regardless of needs for care.

Our qualitative research, comprising 25 detailed household case studies (61 open-ended interviews with multiple family members) in Peru, Mexico, China and Nigeria, identified that the state and local government and health services were largely uninvolved in the care and support of older dependent people, leaving families to negotiate a 'journey without maps'. Women were de facto caregivers, but often not decision-makers. In some settings the traditional role of a female relative as caregiver was begining to be contested. Household composition was flexible and responsive to the changing needs of multiple generations. Stretched finances were a frequent cause of family dissent.

In summary, we have identified a clear link between the development of needs for care in an older household member, and economic strain and relative impoverishment impacting adversely upon all household members. In most low and middle income countries, long-term care arrangements remain the sole responsibility of family members, with the requirement to provide for basic needs and financial support often enshrined in law. The implications of our findings are
1. Population ageing, with the attendant rapid increases in dependent older people, is a development issue
2. Social pensions, and targeted benefits (disability benefits, and compensatory caregiver allowances) would help to bolster and incentivise informal family care systems. The introduction of such policies would be pro-poor, and would promote equity by pooling risk across society
3. There is a need to develop and evaluate community-based health and social care interventions for older people that might reduce the incidence of disability and dependence, and mitigate their impacts on the quality of life of the older person and wider household functioning. Such interventions are not routinely available in any of the countries studied.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>All of our data, qualitative and quantitative, will be made available in anonymised form to the wider scientific community, for secondary data analysis.

As far as our findings relate to the specific issues around dementia care, we are working with several stakeholders linked to the G7 Dementia Legacy process. Specifically we are seeking to ensure that project findings are included in an OECD/ WHO report on long term care systems currently being prepared for the World Dementia Council. Alzheimer's Disease International is considering making 'Women and Dementia' the focus for its 2016 World Alzheimer Report, by which time we will be able to contribute rich and fully analysed data from the INDEP study relating to gendered aspects of care (both informal and paid) across three continents.

We are currently working with the WHO Ageing and Lifecourse Department to develop a new evidence-based health and social care intervention for frail and dependent older people (WHO-COPE). The cross-cutting theme of caregiver support will be strongly informed by emerging INDEP evidence. We also anticipate that INDEP evidence will be constitute an important basis for WHO-led advocacy for governments to invest in scaling up of the package of care and its training procedures within their community health systems. 
We currently have a grant under review with the EU Horizon 2020 program for the phase 2 and phase 3 evaluation of the WHO-COPE intervention in sites in Latin America, Romania and Ethiopia</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>93A9954E-88E5-4B68-AD8E-D4F6551E92BA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.alz.co.uk/1066/indep.php</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This is a fully documented anonymised data archive for all qualitative and quantitative data generated by the INDEP project, filed with the UK Data Service (SN 852071)</gtr:description><gtr:id>3463A30B-DC80-4362-B649-0942E712DDBE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No registered users to date</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>The 10/66 INDEP mixed methods study of the economic and social impact (at household level) of residing with a care dependent older person in China, Mexico, Peru and Nigeria</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/catalogue/?sn=852071&amp;type=Data%20catalogue</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>This data base comprises
a) household interviews with data on household composition, assets, income (and sources), and consumption, health status, needs for care, and healthcare expenditure for all household members 
b) individual interviews with all older residents (aged 65 years and over) with information on health, disability, care given and received, personal income and sources, decision-making autonomy, and basic needs met and unmet.
The data base currently includes data from urban and rural sites in Mexico, Peru and China. Data from Nigeria will be added shortly. 

We have completed 874 household interviews across the six sites in Mexico, Peru and China, from the 1283 households originally selected (an overall household response rate of 68%). At household level, response rates were lower in urban China (52% -mainly due to tracing difficulties following urban redevelopment) and Peru (55% and 59% - with a higher rate of refusal than other sites) but ranged from 78% to 91% in other settings. Household response rates were understandably much lower for care exit households (55%) where all index older persons had died, but similar for incident care (77%), chronic care (67%) and control (70%) households. Once access to the household had been secured, participation rates for index older people were high. Overall, in 672/ 715 households (94%) where interviews of index older people were required, all eligible older people completed an individual interview. In only two of the 715 households were none of the index older people willing or available to be interviewed.</gtr:description><gtr:id>D7978236-5662-4764-ADD3-B0628A51B7B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Anonymised data will be made freely available to the wider scientific community, according to 10/66 Dementia Research Group policies</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>10/66 INDEP houshold and individual interviews</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.alz.co.uk/1066/indep.php</gtr:url></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Self-report ordinal scales to assess decision-making autonomy, and the extent to which basic needs for food, shelter, and medical care are met, partly met, or unmet</gtr:description><gtr:id>E83516EE-C8D1-494A-B1BD-357035FA50F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We shall be incorporating these measures in the next wave of our 10/66 population-based surveys in Latin America and China (2015-19, funded by the European Research Council) to achieve a richer and more detailed assessment of economic status and social protection.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>INDEP 10/66 older person autonomy and met/ unmet needs scales</gtr:title><gtr:type>Physiological assessment or outcome measure</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.alz.co.uk/1066/indep.php</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A structured approach to assessing and attributing household income, household consumption, and indicators of economic strain</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A70A362-98BC-4587-91FA-3247F8838E9C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The questionnaires will be used in adapted form in a European Union funded network consortium (EMERALD) to assess the impact of increasing coverage of community-based treatment of serious mental disorders in 5 low income countries.
