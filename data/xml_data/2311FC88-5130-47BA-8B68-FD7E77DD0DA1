The UK has an extremely strong and vibrant plant science research community with many internationally competitive research groups based in the universities and institutes. Whilst their discoveries have the potential to impact on the key sustainability issues such as the supply of high quality nutritious food, response to climate change and identifying sources of bioenergy, it is evident that translation to successful outcomes suffers from the lack of an effective delivery mechanism to end users. It is against this backdrop that NIAB is investing &amp;pound;1.25 million over 5 years to establish a Centre for Pre-Breeding that will provide a product conferring capability available to all UK researchers and end-users. The Centre will develop a unique platform for delivery of novel traits and associated marker technologies in wheat, oilseed rape, pulses and selected non-food crop applications. Trait genes and markers will be validated in pre-competitive, UK adapted germplasm that can be accessed by commercial breeders and end-users in the non-food area. The Centre will not produce finished varieties and hence won't compete with commercial breeders. NIAB's investment will be used to establish infrastructure and initiate longer-term pre-breeding activities. Funding from this initiative is sought to support pre-breeding in two key areas that address key targets in sustainability of the wheat crop in the UK. Firstly, we will exemplify the translation of a research breakthrough in publicly funded science to practical outcome. The wheat gene Ppd uses day length as a cue to determine when the plant flowers. It is a key adaptability gene; breeders can use variants of the gene to produce varieties that match local environments. An early flowering variety is better suited to hot dry summers where it is important to fill grain before wate is scarce and temperatures soar. Conversely, a delay in flowering sustains yield in cooler and wetter summers, such as those generally experienced in the UK, with a longer period suitable for grain filling. The Laurie group at the John Innes Centre has recently identified three Ppd genes in wheat. In the research proposed here, we will provide the molecular markers for these genes and important new data on their developmental effects. Importantly, there is more to this work than simply accelerating the breeding process; new Ppd variants and flowering time genes will be identified and characterised. This novel variation will be fundamental in providing alternative genes that breeders can exploit to tune flowering in varieties in response to global warming and climate change. Secondly, we will establish a platform for introducing novel variation across a range of wheat traits based on exploitation of a collection of synthetic wheats from the International Centre for Maize and Wheat Improvement (CIMMYT) in Mexico. The conventional view is that the genetic base for wheat improvement in the UK and Europe is very narrow. Synthetic wheats address this issue as they recreate the rare hybridisations that gave rise to the progenitors of our modern bread wheats but dramatically increase genetic diversity by using a range of parents. NIAB will initiate a crossing programme with selected synthetic wheats and varieties from CIMMYT that have a synthetic origin. The objective is to deliver pre-breeding materials to commercial breeders that provide novel traits in key sustainability targets such as novel pathogen and insect pest resistance, biomass and yield potential and tolerance to drought. This work will be undertaken in close collaboration with UK industry facilitated by the British Wheat Breeders and the HGCA and represents the open 'public-private partnership' that will define how the pre-breeding Centre at NIAB operates across all crop targets.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>This project is divided into three work programmes that will deliver pre-breeding outputs. The first will exploit the recent identification of the three wheat Ppd genes (the major determinants of photoperiod response) by the Laurie group at JIC and will: 1 characterise the extent of allelic variation for wheat Ppd 2 develop molecular markers to aid breeding 3 develop near isogenic lines with principal allelic variants to characterise developmental effects attributable to individual alleles. This will provide a robust data set linking individual Ppd alleles to effects on flowering time, ear development and yield potential. Donor germplasm for novel alleles will have been defined and diagnostic molecular markers for all allelic types will aid rapid exploitation by commercial breeders. In the second work programme, we will investigate other loci known to affect flowering time; These 'earliness per se' (Eps) genes are important because they can fine-tune development and adaptation, but this class of genes are very poorly understood. We will use existing mapping populations and data for current varieties to localise Eps genes and quantify their effects. This will provide information on Eps loci that complements Ppd, define their effect on wheat development and identify of sources of variation and linked markers. In the final work area, we will undertake a crossing programme from CIMMYT synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) lines and CIMMYT varieties derived from SHW into UK adapted germplasm. Between 30 and 40 non-redundant SHW will be crossed to an adapted UK wheat to the BC1F2 and then by single seed descent to F5 generating 100 inbred donor lines per original cross. From ten SHW derived varieties, donor segments will be identified by genotyping and transferred by backcross introgression to a UK wheat. After seed multiplication, all lines will be tested for key agronomic and sustainability traits, including drought tolerance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-10-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>646318</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Local animator approached NIAB asking to make an animation to explain NIAB's work on re-synthesis and pre-breeding</gtr:description><gtr:id>FFDC4EC8-E1FC-48F7-AD83-1A60385D9300</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Very favourable feedback from those who have seen it</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Wheat re-synthesis animation</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7bN2C1Pjs0</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Lecture to visiting undergraduates from University of Cambridge, Oct 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5656C018-ADE4-4887-BFEE-49A2E467E980</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk led to interesting discussions afterwards

1) NIAB have developed and screened large numbers of recombinant lines

? In 2010, NIAB grew a nursery of &amp;gt;2800 Paragon/SHW BC1F5 progenies

? Similarly, &amp;gt;2800 Xi-19/SHW BC1F5 progenies were grown in 2011; around half of these were rescreened in 2012

2) Breeders are keen to exploit this material

? 1000 Xi-19/SHW BC1F6 progenies were tested during 2011-12 in a large co-ordinated trial 

? Breeders have also tested all 1000 in disease/adaptation nurseries, and one breeder also screened 250 Paragon/SHW BC1F6 progenies overseas

? These breeder trials and nurseries are all at their own cost

3) High-yielding material can be selected even from simple crosses with SHW

? 65 of NIAB's Paragon/SHW F5 selections were planted in 2010 yield trials by Limagrain; twelve yielded &amp;gt;100% of controls, five&amp;gt;110% and two &amp;gt;120%

? After retesting, two spring lines entered Limagrain's 2012 pre-National List trial series

4) SHW derivatives can do well under stress and low-input conditions

? 29 Xi-19/SHW selections are in WGIN2 drought tolerance trials at Sutton Bonington

? Four of these have out-yielded Xi-19 in at least one season to date ; early indications suggest that this is largely due to increased biomass

? Paragon/SHW selections grown at Rothamsted and Sutton Bonington as part of the wheat pre-breeding LoLa (B/I002561/1) overlap with the best commercial winter varieties under high N; under lower N many of them out-yield the best varieties

5) Some Xi-19/SHW recombinants show genuine yield potential in high-input variety trials

? 2011-12 yield trials identified recombinants which yielded up to 140% relative to Xi-19

? This was in a season of low sunshine, high rainfall, high disease and high lodging pressure, all of which would normally be expected to count against SHW derivatives 

Highlights of NIAB's Ppd and Eps pre-breeding material:

1) NIAB have developed near-isogenic lines for ten genetic variants of the Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1) gene and five Earliness per se (Eps) QTL in two elite winter wheat backgrounds. These lines are a resource for the assessment of the individual effects of each genetic variant of these key adaptation genes/QTL in a common background 

2) Field, glasshouse and controlled environment assessment of the NILs has allowed for determination of the flowering time effect of each variant, providing information on their utility depending on the specific flowering requirement

3) Preliminary yield data for the Ppd-1 NILs in 2011-12 indicates that each of the genetic variants not only affects flowering, but also yield, dependent on seasonal conditions. Early flowering lines consistently out-yielded wild type lines, indicating that in a season with sub-optimal conditions (low sunshine, high rainfall, disease) they confer an adaptive advantage which is of interest to the breeders. It is also possible to begin to explore the underlying mechanisms for this advantage using the resource created

4) The incorporation of a novel genetic variant for Ppd-1 recently discovered in durum (pasta) wheat represents the first evidence of its ability to reduce flowering time in a bread wheat background under field conditions. This represents a new source of earliness for breeders to exploit.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Many of the SHW backcross lines now have detailed phenotypic information attached to them. This can used with molecular marker data to examine the genetic components derived from the synthetic wheat donors and thus identify the best regions contributing to variety performance for applications in wheat breeding programmes. In the longer term these regions my be further dissected and the genes responsible for yield improvement and other important traits identified and cloned.

The Ppd and Eps lines have been comprehensively phenotyped for flowering time under field and controlled environment conditions, providing data on the role of isolated genetic variants of key genes/QTLs in common, elite backgrounds with relevance for their utility in promoting flowering in commercial bread wheat lines. The incorporation of the durum wheat variant into hexaploid germplasm has been published (Bentley et al. (2011) Plant Breeding 130:10-15), and the characterisation of the flowering effects of the complete set of Ppd NILs, and the markers used in their development has also been accepted for publication (Bentley et al. (in press) Journal of Experimental Botany) making this information more widely available. The NILs represent a powerful resource. At one end of the spectrum they can be used to further dissect the effect of these defined genetic variants on specific developmental phases, and at the other end of the spectrum, their effects on yield under varying environmental/ecogeographical conditions can be determined, with relevance to predicting the utility of these variants in a climate change scenario. 
 We work closely with the three breeding companies (KWS, Limagrain and RAGT) which contributed to the funding of this project.These companies have tested SHW breeding material in their programmes and in at least one instance have incorporated NIAB's lines into their proprietary germplasm. One of the breeding companies has also grown and assessed the Ppd and Eps NILs for flowering time effects vs known early and late lines in two field seasons.

In addition, a BBSRC Super Follow-On Fund proposal has been submitted to take the best lines from the NIAB closer to commercial exploitation.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DB12BD92-35F5-428F-8BE5-6C236D64A194</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Case study for UK Agritech Strategy, p23</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA7D5B19-7A65-49EB-BE9B-DC7D270259F2</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/227259/9643-BIS-UK_Agri_Tech_Strategy_Accessible.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/43B780E9-C63A-4719-8BA1-9DD8FA7CE950"><gtr:id>43B780E9-C63A-4719-8BA1-9DD8FA7CE950</gtr:id><gtr:title>Application of genomics-assisted breeding for generation of climate resilient crops: progress and prospects.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6cbe43987db5c8b517ad1b2097001cb8"><gtr:id>6cbe43987db5c8b517ad1b2097001cb8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kole C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-462X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EB38ED7D-14FC-4CE0-8DF4-53DAABA0FDA5"><gtr:id>EB38ED7D-14FC-4CE0-8DF4-53DAABA0FDA5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Determining Phenological Patterns Associated with the Onset of Senescence in a Wheat MAGIC Mapping Population.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Frontiers in plant science</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/69be0e7d1bcbd8db021ca27fb99514d5"><gtr:id>69be0e7d1bcbd8db021ca27fb99514d5</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Camargo AV</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1664-462X</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/291312B4-5B64-4EE4-976A-1EAFEB66382E"><gtr:id>291312B4-5B64-4EE4-976A-1EAFEB66382E</gtr:id><gtr:title>High-density SNP genotyping array for hexaploid wheat and its secondary and tertiary gene pool.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Plant biotechnology journal</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d19fb05ac09f4e62a8ec298a0ff9b389"><gtr:id>d19fb05ac09f4e62a8ec298a0ff9b389</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Winfield MO</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>1467-7644</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/96CA6641-051D-45D4-AE2A-1DAF459BCA20"><gtr:id>96CA6641-051D-45D4-AE2A-1DAF459BCA20</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pre-breeding in UK cereal crops -
