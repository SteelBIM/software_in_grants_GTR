Project</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K007726/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Digging Caerau Will involve community participants in a major research excavation at Caerau Iron Age hillfort to uncover further details about the site's fascinating prehistoric past that were so tantalisingly suggested by exploratory excavations and geophysical surveys in phase 1 of the project. 

Caerau hillfort is one of the largest and most impressive in south-east Wales, inside of which was constructed a medieval ringwork and medieval church and graveyard with early-modern and modern graves. Debate about the role and function of hillforts is at the centre of Iron Age research in Britain. However, the history of academic interests over the last 100 years has led to the lack of a uniform level of regional knowledge, which has seriously distorted understanding of hillforts and of the period. In particular, there has been a paucity of excavation and research of hillforts in southeast Wales. Glamorgan has been the subject of a survey by the RCAHMW (1976), but it is one thing to be able to locate hillforts and describe their morphology, yet quite another to fix their construction, development and occupation through time. Too few have been excavated to support a credible picture or chronology for the region (only 23 of 130 sites have received any investigation through excavation). Therefore, there is a pressing need to challenge the weak chronological framework and the received wisdom of a dearth of material culture from hillforts in southeast Wales. Caerau hillfort therefore provides an opportunity to explore these issues through co-produced research with the community. Caerau hillfort is one of the largest multivallate hillforts in South Wales, but before Phase 1 it had never been subject to archaeological investigation. This research will therefore further contextualise the character of activity within the interior of the hillfort. Unfortunately, investigation of the site is challenging since the whole area is a focus for a range of anti-social behaviour including burning events, graffiti and vandalism. The CAER Heritage Project's research objective is to help the people of Caerau and Ely to connect with this site's fascinating the past and make it relevant to the present, engendering the heritage of the district with greater value for contemporary communities in relation to identity and aspirational opportunity.

Building on existing partnerships and trust, local community members, schools and academic researchers will work together to provide a cutting edge interpretation of the site which will not only enhance research knowledge but will also inform an innovative experimental heritage reconstruction of Iron Age Life at St Fagans National History Museum just over a mile away - providing a remarkable project legacy. As in phase 1 of the project, community participants will be involved in co-production of research activities and interpretations with university academics - creating educational opportunities, learning skills, building confidence, confronting stigmas and challenging the aspirational poverty which blights so many families within these communities. The project constitutes a journey which will see community participants and researchers 'deconstructing' a decommissioned reconstructed Iron-Age village at St Fagans National Museum of Wales - then taking the skills and team spirit forged in that process to explore an authentic and un-researched Iron-Age archaeological site at the heart of their communities - then finally they will use the knowledge and skills that they have uncovered to inform and undertake the construction of a new experimental reconstruction of an Iron Age settlement at St Fagans. Through these initiatives Digging Caerau will forge a much closer relationship between the Caerau and Ely communities and the National Museum and University on their doorstep. This will be further cemented by the expansion of the heritage trail proposed by the HEART of Cardiff Follow Up funding bid.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>In the Iron Age the people of Caerau expressed their identity and confidence in the landscape through monumental earthworks. Today, however, Caerau and Ely are areas of significant social and economic deprivation and marginalisation. The archaeological excavation at the heart of the Digging Caerau project therefore provides a potent physical metaphor for digging down into the heart of the community to acquire both knowledge and a re-energized sense of confidence and identity founded upon a distinct and unique past. Recognition, both internal and external, of this vibrant heritage will help to address anti-social behaviour on Caerau hill and improve the presentation of the hillfort and surrounding area creating a valuable resource for leisure and learning activities.
Through co-production of research with academic partners and heritage experts, the project aims to engage with a wide range of people from the local communities. It will raise local aspirations, nurturing a more positive sense of place while challenging externally held negative attitudes towards Caerau and Ely and its communities. Digging Caerau will thereby facilitate a powerful connection between local people and the value of their heritage through the physical and intellectual exploration of the archaeology of their community. A range of informal and formal educational activities providing skills and challenging aspirational poverty will be delivered and developed through the process of co-produced archaeological research. This research will inform both academic &amp;amp; heritage interpretations of this largely unresearched site expressed through educational progression, heritage themed creative art and a legacy of a heritage infrastructure including: a reconstructed Iron Age village and a heritage trail in conjunction with the HEART of Cardiff project (submitted separately). All of these will involve community members as active participants, contributors and beneficiaries. 
Particular benefits will include:
1. Opportunities for training/educational development for young people &amp;amp; adults inculcating a wide range of skills (communication, team building, numeracy, articulacy) through co-production of research &amp;amp; heritage interpretation &amp;amp; reproduction. 
2. To undertake a program of co-produced research with local schools embedding the CAER heritage project &amp;amp; Digging Caerau into participating school curriculums (e.g. Phase 1 CAER heritage Churchyard Detectives project was embedded into Glyn Derw Year 7 integrated literacy curriculum). 
3. To create lasting, positive &amp;amp; meaningful links between schools, community organisations &amp;amp; Cardiff University through the process of co-production.
4. In conjunction with the HEART of Cardiff Project, to provide a range of archaeological activities including co-produced research to engage local people, especially young people facing exclusion inculcating new skills and improving confidence and esteem. 
5. To challenge aspirational poverty &amp;amp; break down barriers to education through a range of educational opportunities both formal and informal relating to the co-production of research. 
6. To create lasting positive &amp;amp; meaningful links between Caerau and Ely communities &amp;amp; the heritage sector in Cardiff, particularly St Fagans National History Museum.
7. To create a lasting infrastructure of heritage resources, co-created by local people, which bring heritage sector expertise &amp;amp; sustained positive contact into the Caerau &amp;amp; Ely communities.
8. To provide opportunities for members of the local community of all ages to work together on a co-produced research project &amp;amp; to develop their own sustainable heritage projects.
9. To promote the skills, value &amp;amp; vibrancy of the communities of Caerau &amp;amp; Ely, generating confidence &amp;amp; showcasing the talent within them to external audiences through the Digging Caerau &amp;amp; HEART of Cardiff projects.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>71778</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>During the 2013 Digging Caerau excavations, an unemployed local filmmaker, Viv Thomas, filmed every aspect of this community dig and interviewed many participants and visitors.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh). The A4 sized mural design was then scaled to full size - over 15 metres in length - and painstakingly applied onto the underpass and in masonry paint. The young people from the youth centre participated in the painting and added their own graffiti 'tags'. The resulting artwork constituted a vivid, direct, contemporary connection to the pre-historic past which has since been incorporated into the HEART of Cardiff Heritahe Trails network.</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F565DB3-CADF-4B33-AFD1-791092157BE9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CAER team, including artist Paul Evans and Ian Daniel (Celtic demonstrator from the National Museum of Wales), worked with 3 Youth Workers to develop and devise a programme of heritage themed trips and create an art installation with a small group of young people facing exclusion.

This structure formed a customised projection booth, within which we projected footage real-time from the Caerau dig 2014 as was it taking place on the hill fort. Footage from the dig taking place at Caerau wass projected inside The Virtual Dig. Visitors to the festival were encouraged to 'excavate' The Virtual Trench and, under the guidance of CAER Heritage Project archaeologists and community volunteers, use genuine tools and specialised techniques to uncover real finds from the real dig which had been excavated in the preceding days. A special screening of the 'Caeraustock' short films - co-created by local cameraman Viv Thomas, local residents, LightTrap films and Michaelston Community College - added a further layer of visual depth and interaction to the installation.

The heads were then photographed and digitised for studio development into a professional quality animation. Local resident and filmmaker, Viv Thomas, undertook audio and filmed interviews over the course of the excavation inviting local participants to express their feelings and experiences about the Caerau site including their involvement in archaeological research and discovery. Broader stories about the area's heritage were collected from local residents of all ages through community group networks. Both of these processes were facilitated by a local co-ordinator working with community development organisation Action in Caerau and Ely (ACE).

15 pupils from Y8 - Y10 of Woodland High School and 15 pupils from Y8 from neighbouring Glyn Derw High School/Michaelston Community College (once two separate schools but recently federated) worked with professional artist Paul Evans and Cardiff University CAER Heritage Project to co-produce designs for a series of Iron Age 'playable artworks': themed sports equipment including 'Ping Pong Portals to the Past' or 'Iron Age Street Art' outdoor table tennis tables, decorated table tennis balls, and football kit. After the conclusion of the project the table tennis tables have been permanently sited outside The Michaelston Community College learning centre Ely and Woodlands High school.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E3A51767-2FA0-4A81-A6B4-1D64EDDDDCFB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Romanobritish' brought together two local schools, thus strengthening community bonds, challenging stereotypes, improving life choices, developing confidence, partnerships and social networks. The project and its output were also a unique, creative means of bringing the inspiration for this project - the Iron Age heritage of Caerau and Ely to life and, quite literally, into play. Caerau and Ely are host to an extraordinary physical heritage: one of the largest hill forts in South Wales and a Roman villa buried beneath the school playing fields - two sites that local school children have had hands on roles in investigating through the CAER Heritage Project. What made this project so distinctive is not only this amazing heritage, but also its foundation on mutually supportive creative play. This fed directly into 'playable' artworks: doorways to engagement with heritage, and stimuli for future curiosity/discussion way beyond the timescale of the project.
The project offered participating young people a structured framework of creative workshops and university quality accessible visual/historical references and acted as a pilot project based around collaborative participation from a special needs and mainstream school. A series of intensive creative workshops with a professional artist and an academic were delivered in these community schools. Qualitative outecomes included valuing artistic ability of young people with learning disabilities within the creative process, inculcating pride in place, development of grass roots relationships, aiding transition at a time of upheaval for Glyn Derw High pupils (the school was at that time being merged and effectively closed down). Challenging stigmas between mainstream and special needs secondary education, expanding social networks and providing new life opportunities by working with creative and academic professionals, raising aspirations and breaking down barriers to higher education, valuing community assets - in particular local heritage.

Through the exhibition, Cardiff residents and visitors to the city experience the positive, vibrant history of Ely and Caerau, thus tackling ill-founded stereotypes and the external stigmas about the area. 
This project worked with elderly residents, valuing their knowledge and expertise, developing social networks, addressing isolation and nurturing intergenerational contact with young people. 30 year 9 school pupils gained opportunities for educational development and new skills including communication, team building, numeracy and literacy. 20 people were interviewed by the children for the exhibition and mural. 
As the school involved has a low take-up to University, breaking down barriers to HE was a significant objective, with pupils working alongside academics and postgraduates. One sixth-former who participated is now considering studying history at university. 
A further 60 people contributed to the project, by sharing memories at a range of local events in collaboration with community development partner ACE (Action in Caerau and Ely). Participants got a greater understanding not only of their WW1 heritage, but of the houses and streets in which they live. 
The project reinforced the University's commitment to the co-production of knowledge with local communities. It facilitated strong partnerships with local community groups and non-HE partners. Follow on projects are now planned to explore local place names and the project has also informed aspects of a recently secured large Heritage Lottery Grant to explore the area's rich archaeology and heritage. 
One of the schoolchildren involved said: &amp;quot; it was interesting to see what happened and what Ely was like back thenit was a fun experience, especially at the Glamorgan Archives and interviewing people who have lived in Ely for many yearsI loved hearing older people's stories about what they experienced in the past and seeing how different it was to my own life in Ely now.&amp;quot;
One of the hardest to reach pupils - who was at risk of exclusion from school - said in his feedback that the project had helped him understand how important school is, helped his learning in school, helped improve his confidence and social skills and that he learnt new skills on the trip. After a visit to the Glamorgan Archives, in his words, he said 'It was sick. I want to go here again.' He has since undertaken work experience at the Archives.

Pathway to the Past Mural, March 2013 (see CAER blog entries March 2013)
Pathway to the Past was a CAER spin-off project funded by an All Our Stories HLF grant in collaboration with our community partners Action Caerau &amp;amp; Ely (ACE) - working with staff from the National History Museum, North Ely Youth and Community Centre and 10 local young people (aged between 14-16) experiencing exclusion from school. Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail.

Celtic Village Excavation 
Digging Caerau 2013 started with a training excavation for local people at St Fagans National History Museum in May 2013. Recent redevelopment of the museum meant that the museum's 'Celtic Village' (made up of 3 reconstructed Iron Age roundhouses) was demolished. This provided an opportunity for local people to learn basic excavation skills on a 'replica' Iron Age site before encountering the real thing as part of an accredited adult learner's course.

Photos and Iolo Exhibition, July 2014 (as part of Connected Communities Festival)
Photos and Iolo was a CAER Heritage Project exhibition format that was developed and co-produced by artist Paul Evans with pupils from Glyn Derw High School, National Museum Wales staff Loveday Williams, Owain Rhys and Ian Daniel, and CAER Heritage Project directors Dave Wyatt and Oliver Davis. Consisting of a series of re-usable pop-up banners Photos and Iolo was an interactive experience that encouraged viewers to get involved with the images on display by searching for the bard Iolo (or Ian Daniel, the Museum's Celtic demonstrator) - photo-shopped into images of Caerau and Ely that were taken by local residents. Once the participants have found Iolo then they are encouraged to take part in a riddle competition. These Riddles were created by pupils from Glyn Derw High School. The images featured came from a Barnardos project which took place in Ely and Caerau in the 1980s.

Over a period of several weeks the young people designed and co-created an Iron Age themed mural to signpost the trail. The mural was designed and developed by the young people during a series of intensive street-art workshops devised by Paul Evans, in close collaboration with St Fagan's Iron Age expert and artist Ian Daniel. To set the context, the young people visited the Iron Age reconstructed hillfort at Castell Henllys in West Wales. Here they engaged in two workshops devised by Paul. The first, a digital photography activity, was based on the micro-montages of street artist Slinkachu, and the other was a variation on eco-graffiti activities that Paul had used to effect during previous stages of the project. In this instance, the young people left their outlines on the side of the fort - a biodegradeable impression of their visit. 

Back at the youth centre, the young people engaged in two days of drawing workshops, generating letters and figures that Paul and Ian developed into finished designs for council approval. The young people were then given a choice of five designs based on their ideas and motifs - with Ian's design getting the vote. The mural design features two Iron Age Round houses, 'Ely beans' and graceful 'celto-graffiti' lettering spelling out the word Caerau (meaning 'hill-forts' in Welsh). The A4 sized mural design was then scaled to full size - over 15 metres in length - and painstakingly applied onto the underpass and in masonry paint. The young people from the youth centre participated in the painting and added their own graffiti 'tags'. The resulting artwork constituted a vivid, direct, contemporary connection to the pre-historic past and has been incorporated into the wider HEART of Cardiff Heritage trails network.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>North Ely Youth and Community Centre (Pethybridge) is a multipurpose centre that has been at the heart of its community for many years.

CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.
Travel Back to the Iron Age @Cardiff Story week of family activities (February, 2013)
In conjunction with the CAER exhibition at the Cardiff Story Museum, the CAER team, including 15 undergraduate volunteers, delivered a week of lunchtime family interactive activities during half-term February 2013 themed on the exhibition and the Iron Age in Cardiff. The museum estimates that 200 visiting parents and children from the Cardiff locality participated in these activities alone and highlighted that many of these visitors were first time visitors to the museum.

These activities included artefact analysis and Iron-Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron-Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.

The week of school activities culminated with a project open day for local families at the Caerau site with further participation in surveying and other interactive activities by local adult residents. 150 local residents attended this event, and many came with their families and stayed for most of the day - a positive response to our strategy of attempting to engage and build trust with the wider community through the local secondary schools.

Participation in Timeteam &amp;amp; community excavations.
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. 
Benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013). Timeteam episode viewing figures frequently exceed 1.5m in the UK alone and the programme is also broadcast in a number of other countries, giving wide exposure to both the communities and this little known archaeological site. 
CAER Project Exhibition (June 2012-February 2013)
Following on from their involvement in geophysical survey, the creation of tribal logo artwork and Timeteam excavations 90 pupils from 3 participating secondary schools, produced displays of artwork, models, creative writing and historical perspectives on the Iron Age. Their coursework made up an exhibition which was displayed at St Fagans National History Museum in June 2012. The exhibition was opened by Mark Drakeford, Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and Sian Price, series director of Timeteam. 

In January and February 2013 we took this exhibition on tour - first we were invited to the Welsh Government's Senedd building in Cardiff Bay by Mark Drakeford and then travelled onto the Cardiff Story Museum in central Cardiff later in February 2013. The then heritage minister, Huw Lewis, opened the exhibition at Cardiff Story and also launched Digging Caerau, with the exhibition remaining on display at the museum for 4 weeks. Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context.

In March 2012, 90 pupils and 5 teachers from 3 participating secondary schools, Glyn Derw, Fitzalan and Mary Immaculate High were involved in a range of activities at the Caerau hillfort designed to interest and invest them in the site and conduct research. These activities included artefact analysis and Iron Age pottery workshops. Pupils participated directly in a geophysical survey of part of the site with an archaeological professional revealing the boundaries and houses of the ancient occupants of this place for the first time. Inspired by Iron Age artefacts they had seen at a field trip to the National History Museum, St Fagans, the pupils designed their own tribal symbols with professional artist, Paul Evans, and then scaled up these designs to land-art dimensions within the hillfort, using safe and biodegradeable tree bark. This activity proved very successful in both interesting and positively investing young people with the heritage of the site. The large eco-graffiti tribal logos subsequently gently biodegraded into the landscape and - significantly - were not disturbed by the groups of young people who regularly visit the site outside of school.
School participation in Timeteam excavation and Programme (April, 2012).
As a result of the above activities, Channel 4's Timeteam, with whom our School had been having negotiations, agreed to work in collaboration with the CAER project to undertake trial excavations and produce a programme about the hillfort. We negotiated for 10 local pupils (from three participating secondary schools) and 3 local residents from the community to both participate in the excavation and appear on the programme. The overall benefits of this media intervention, generally, outweighed any short-term negative impacts. Indeed, these benefits were significant in terms of both research, raising the profile of the site and highlighting talent within the local communities. Community participants and the communities of Caerau and Ely more broadly, featured in a very positive light in the subsequent programme (which was broadcast nationally in January 2013). Timeteam episode viewing figures frequently exceed 1.5m in the UK alone and the programme is also broadcast in a number of other countries, giving wide exposure to both the communities and this little known archaeological site. 
CAER Project Exhibition (June 2012-February 2013)
Following on from their involvement in geophysical survey, the creation of tribal logo artwork and Timeteam excavations 90 pupils from 3 participating secondary schools, produced displays of artwork, models, creative writing and historical perspectives on the Iron Age. Their coursework made up an exhibition which was displayed at St Fagans National History Museum in June 2012. The exhibition was opened by Mark Drakeford, Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services and Sian Price, series director of Timeteam. 
In January and February 2013 we took this exhibition on tour - first we were invited to the Welsh Government's Senedd building in Cardiff Bay by Mark Drakeford and then travelled onto the Cardiff Story Museum in central Cardiff later in February 2013. The then heritage minister, Huw Lewis, opened the exhibition at Cardiff Story and also launched Digging Caerau, with the exhibition remaining on display at the museum for 4 weeks. Participating pupils and teachers from the respective schools attended all of these exhibition launches and teacher feedback has highlighted the benefits in terms of pupil enskilment and confidence building. It is estimated that over 1,500 visitors viewed the exhibition across the three locations, once again significantly raising the profile of community talent and heritage assets in Caerau and Ely within the wider Cardiff context. 
CHURCHYARD Detectives Project (November 2012)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history/archaeology project which focussed on the modern historical context of the Caerau locality. Pupils were initially involved in fieldwork noting inscriptions from graves in St Mary's Church on Caerau Hillfort. Following this they undertook research with historians and archivists at the Glamorgan Archives, reconstructing the lives of those buried there in the 19th and early 20th centuries. From this research they produced project work and performative presentations which were delivered at the Cardiff Story event in February 2013. This project was embedded in Glyn Derw's Literacy and Numeracy curriculum for that class, a first for the CAER Project. The strategy of embedding co-produced research within the secondary school curriculum has subsequently been employed successfully within other CAER project activities; it has proved very effective in terms of cementing a close partnership with participating schools, enhancing project development and outputs and breaking down barriers to HE.
Poverty Detectives Project (March 2013)
30 year 9 pupils from Glyn Derw High took part in this history project which explored child poverty past and present with a focus on the lives of 19th century children in the Cardiff area. The pupils worked with academic historians, archivists at the Glamorgan Archives and CAER project artist Paul Evans to creatively express their findings through the creation of time-travelling conversations enacted by puppets created by the pupils. This project produced some inspiring outputs and was also embedded in the literacy and numeracy curriculum.
Digging Caerau Excavations (June-July 2013 and 2014) 
Glyn Derw High pupils and teachers were directly involved with the excavations with several classes undertaking archaeological fieldwork activities. More than 80 pupils, varying in age-group from Year 7 to Year 13 visited the site, over the two excavations, and worked in small groups with professional staff as supervisors. They were actively involved with various different on-site activities from excavation, sieving and finds processing, to more creative activities such as making Iron Age pots.
School co-production of way marks logos (December 2014 to March 2014)
In December 2013 Dave Wyatt and Paul Evans visited Michaelston College and Glyn Derw to brainstorm, design and develop the first two way-mark designs for the HEART of Cardiff trails. These intensive creative workshops focussed on 'Medieval Michaelston' and the 'Romans to the Races' trails. After a brief introduction, the young people made a series of quick thumbnail sketches. The young people then selected their favourite sketch and were given guidance on how to convert this design into a simple motif, suitable for stencilling.
Two follow on workshops were delivered to the same classes in each school in March 2014. The challenge behind the workshops was to create transitory, witty works of art that reflected something of the heritage of the trail - creating ephemeral artworks and in situ images to populate our heritage trail resources. At Glyn Derw High we researched Roman motifs and made a series of thumb-nail sketches. We then visited the heritage trail in Trelai fields to create an army of buried legionaries emerging from the site of the Roman Villa on the Romans to Races trail. The young artists then made 3D graffiti models and placed these along the trail photographing them as they went. 
A similar workshop was also undertaken with the pupils at Michaelston Community College, this time themed on the medieval heritage of the location including St Michael's church. We decided that the door of the church would make an excellent 'portal' into the past - so we made one using interwoven twigs and branches. As at Glyn Derw, during the next stage of the workshop the young people made individual ephemeral artworks using modelling clay - again from the preliminary sketches based on Medieval motifs. The, tried and tested, combination of archaeological and historically themed art and direct physical engagement with local sites proved an effective means of investing and engaging a new group of young people in their local heritage whilst inculcating a range of creative and interpersonal skills.
Way marking the Trails (April 2014)
With the way mark logos complete the designs have been employed to create a series of plastic stencils that have been laser cut with the assistance of teachers at Michaelston Community College. Over April 2014 the community groups and school pupils involved in creating the way mark logos have walked each of their respective trails employing the stencils to make impermanent (chalk, scrubbing surfaces, grass cutting) and permanent marks (spray paint) at key points on the trails to mark the way. 
These way marks interface with a published trail leaflet and online HEART of Cardiff trail web resource for the trails which features artwork and other contributions of memories and knowledge from participating schools and community members. To ensure ongoing 'ownership' and engagement of co-creators and their trails both ACE and participating schools have agreed to organise bi-annual trail walks to litter pick, monitor access, vegetation clearance and to refresh the impermanent and permanent markers with the way mark logo stencils.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Both school management and staff have been engaged and involved in all stages of the project including funding bid consultation.

Please provide a brief summary.

To date, the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc.) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). A range of key strategies have been employed by CAER to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Oliver Davis) within ACE; the development of a close partnership with local secondary schools; the establishment of community-based adult learners courses; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to involve young people facing exclusion in creating a heritage themed art; community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The wide ranging nature of the project's impacts, partnerships and the embedding of academics and a professional artist within a community context resulted in multifarious, often 'organically' nurtured forms of engagement and co-production. This included the embedding of research co-production within the curricula of participating secondary schools with pupils undertaking geophysical surveys, archaeological excavation, creating museum exhibitions, performances and artwork, heritage trails and participating in a Timeteam programme and two seasons of community excavations. The involvement of professional artist, Paul Evans, in all stages of the project proved a particularly successful strategy. Paul designed and facilitated creative forms of engagement with local heritage themes including large eco-graffiti art installations, puppet shows, heritage trail design and the creation of an Iron-Age themed mural with both local pupils in mainstream secondary education and young people excluded from school. Furthermore, the embedding of research within a series of free accredited adult-education courses in practical archaeology, in association with Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning, proved successful in engaging long term unemployed males in co-production - with clear benefits in terms of progression and confidence building for a number of individuals. CAER established innovative and ongoing social and professional partnerships thereby creating a new 'community of practice' (Hart et al, 2012). A crucial ingredient in this creation has been the equal value placed on the contributions and 'knowledge bases' of all partners, whether trained professional or community volunteers. From the outset, community members, secondary schools and community development agencies were integrated in the project's development. This included the establishment of a 'Friends of Caerau' community group which continues to meet bi-monthly and organises litter picks, trail clearances and heritage events. It also included the establishment of a special and ongoing partnership with the management team at two local secondary schools, Glyn Derw and Michaelston Community College, who embedded aspects of local heritage into the curriculum. Moreover, CAER has grown from relatively humble beginnings in 2011 to become one of the key community projects of partner organisation ACE. ACE is a community based organisation which aims to support the social, economic and environmental regeneration of Ely and Caerau. ACE staff worked with the university staff, every step of the way, to plan the development of CAER; providing access to a network of local community groups enabling the involvement of local residents in project activities. ACE facilitated further funding grant successes (e.g. HLF All Our Stories) and ensured that CAER was integrated into, and continues to benefit from, 'Timeplace' (Ely and Caerau's timebank). ACE have therefore brought incredible assets to the project, most notably the trust and networks that they had built up over years with local people and community groups, but also a deep knowledge of the area and an insightful understanding of the challenges faced by these communities. Over time, the academic team and ACE staff developed a mutual respect for each other, more akin to friendship than partnership. These co-production strategies, partnerships and the involvement and commitment of ACE and the community groups have therefore ensured the Project's future beyond existing funding streams and is enabling activities to continue 'on the ground' while further funding grants are secured.

Despite being one of the largest hillforts in south Wales, Caerau had never been subject to archaeological investigation and there was no evidence for the date of the monument nor for the nature of the occupation. The second phase (AHK007726/1) of the project, known as 'Digging Caerau' completed the characterisation of activity within the interior of the hillfort. As in phase 1, the CAER Heritage Project's research objective was to work with the people of Caerau and Ely to take 'ownership' for the site by making it relevant to the present community; to provide a heritage asset for the locality and the region; and to use the excavations and related activities to provide educational and aspirational opportunities for the local community through the co-production of research knowledge.

Building on existing partnerships and trust, local community members, schools and academic researchers worked together to provide an interpretation of the site which has not only enhanced research knowledge but has also informed an innovative experimental heritage reconstruction of Iron Age Life at St Fagans National History Museum just over a mile away, providing a remarkable project legacy. Community participants have been involved in co-production of research activities and interpretations with university academics, creating educational opportunities, learning skills, building confidence and confronting the negative stereotypes which blight these communities. The project constitutes a journey which has seen community participants and researchers 'deconstructing' a decommissioned Iron-Age replica village at St Fagans National Museum of Wales, then taking the skills and team spirit forged in that process to explore an authentic and under-researched Iron-Age and Medieval archaeological site at the heart of their communities, then finally using the knowledge and skills that they have uncovered to inform and undertake the construction of a new experimental reconstruction of an Iron Age settlement at St Fagans National History Museum. Through these initiatives Digging Caerau has forged a much closer relationship between the Caerau and Ely communities and the National Museum and University on their doorstep. This has been further cemented by the expansion of a series of heritage trails linking Caerau Hillfort to St Fagans National History Museum as part of the HEART of Cardiff project AH/K007629/1.

In archaeological terms, the project's research findings have included significant new archaeological evidence revealing human occupation at Caerau from the Neolithic through to the Medieval period. Findings include the discovery of five Iron-Age roundhouses, well-preserved animal bones, a large pottery assemblage and a range of other artifacts which have significantly improved understanding of Iron-Age settlement in South Wales. All of these findings have included local community members and pupils as active research participants at every stage including excavation, geophysical surveying, post-excavation analysis as well as creative artistic and historical research initiatives as evidenced through a wide range of outputs. The project also has a significant social sciences dimension with work being undertaken on co-production and co-evaluation strategies and on interactions between community participants and heritage professionals.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>From the outset the CAER Heritage Project's key objectives have been to use history and archaeology to develop educational opportunities and to challenge stigmas and marginalisation associated within the local communities. After all, the presence of a large multivallate hillfort in this area suggests that in prehistory Caerau and Ely were actually once the power centre in the Cardiff region. The project therefore aims to celebrate this remarkable past and to realise the potential of the significant yet underutilised heritage assets within these communities. The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners. To date the project has involved a myriad of non-HE partners (primary and secondary schools, community groups, youth workers, community development workers, local residents, the National Museum of Wales, Cardiff Story Museum, Glamorgan Archives, Cardiff Council etc) alongside academics, undergraduates and postgraduates from a range of disciplines at Cardiff (history, archaeology, social sciences). The co-production strategies employed by the project in relation to community and heritage assets have significant transferability and have been recently recognised in a national award bestowed by the NCCPE. 

We therefore believe the CAER Project's co-production strategies and the emphasis which it places on the value of community assets in relation to heritage are truly innovative and provide an exemplary model for other community based archaeology and history projects. The wide ranging nature of the project's impacts, partnerships and the embedding of academics and a professional artist within a community context have resulted in multifarious, often 'organically' nurtured forms of innovation, co-production and engagement. These have included:
? The embedding of research within the curricula of participating secondary schools with pupils producing museum exhibitions, performances and artwork, heritage trails school projects and even participating in a Timeteam programme.
? The involvement of a professional artist, Paul Evans, in all stages of the project thereby facilitating creative forms of engagement with local heritage themes including large eco-graffiti art installations, puppet shows, heritage trail design and the creation of an Iron-Age themed mural with local young people excluded from school. 
? The embedding of research within a series of accredited practical archaeology courses, in association with Cardiff Centre for Lifelong Learning, which have proved particularly successful in engaging long term unemployed males and which have had clear benefits in terms of progression and confidence building for a number of individuals.
? The involvement of postgraduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of engagement initiatives including excavation, museum exhibitions and the development of schools outreach workshops.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8E5CF116-E5D7-4329-8DD7-309A5CFCF33F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://caerheritageprojectdotcom1.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/caer2englishfinalweb.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team invited to contribute to advisory session re proposed NCCPE Research for All Journal.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E5C43B46-52BF-4315-9351-871A4FC1F0D8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Heritage Debate in Welsh Government: CAER Project highlighted as a good example of heritage regeneration in Welsh Government Senedd debate on 'ensuring wider access to our heritage and culture' (at 4:12.05) re link below.</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40F18E82-AC1D-48F4-A6C5-92FF48A8CF91</gtr:id><gtr:type>Gave evidence to a government review</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.senedd.tv/archiveplayer.jsf?v=en_100000_21_01_2014&amp;t=13569&amp;l=en</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team meet with Director of Education LEA Cardiff to discuss plans for CAER to inform curriculum in West Cardiff secondary schools</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC28F121-1E38-4151-83E9-4A32131F0D73</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER Project Featured in RCUK Publications including RCUK Inspiration to Engage Concordat Publication and Research for Community Heritage Brochure</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4C82D552-A868-458C-A49E-28DC108FB3AA</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/RCUK-prod/assets/documents/publications/ConcordatInspiration.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>NCCPE Award highlights CAER Project as an example of best practice re co-production</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>FF27E15C-EAB3-4E9F-96DB-2EE620BA5E70</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.publicengagement.ac.uk/blog/caer-heritage-project</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER co-production presentation delivered to the RCUK Public Engagement with Research Advisory Group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1214D7B1-E046-4C7D-BA3C-43DD9772DC86</gtr:id><gtr:type>Participation in a advisory committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER team deliver bespoke seminar on co-production strategies to RCUK staff at Polaris House (arranged by NCCPE)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8C5CA372-9269-4048-B0F5-F2BA0C8345D7</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>CAER Project the subject of an AHRC Impact Case Study (Hyland/Lugg) and Film</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AAC45577-4572-436D-829D-6280798C0A02</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/News-and-Events/News/Pages/Research-Councils-UK-(RCUK)-Impact-Report-2013.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>The CAER Heritage Project is committed to producing research that involves participants actively in the co-production of knowledge and which values the contributions of all participants and partners.

Co-production is a term becoming current in some European policy circles (Boyle and Harris 2009; Needham 2008) and in Wales, values of 'community' have long been the rallying cry of Welsh politicians (Rees 1997). Yet, too often, the concept of 'community' is approached by professionals and outsiders simplistically, lacking structures for on-going, systematic means of eliciting and hearing its 'differentiated solidarities' (Young 2002 in Amin 2005, 627). We did not approach the aspiration of co-production uncritically and are aware of the potential issues around power, politics and participation (Gallagher and Gallacher 2008; Holland et al. 2010; Bell 2013). 

A range of key strategies have therefore been employed within the Project to ensure meaningful co-production and mutual benefit between the wide range of academic, heritage sector and community partners involved. These include: community consultation and involvement in funding bids; the embedding of an academic member of staff (Dr. Olly Davis) within our partner community organisation ACE; the embedding of activities in the local secondary school curriculum; the establishment of adult learners courses with a view to facilitating educational progression; the creation of partnerships with a local youth centre and the National Museum of Wales to engage young people facing exclusion; training excavations and community outreach opportunities for university students working closely alongside community participants. The co-production strategies employed are based on well established principles yet the CAER team's approach to these principles and to co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research (e.g. NCCPE Award &amp;amp; seminar delivered to RCUK)</gtr:description><gtr:id>3A4A428A-BF4D-480A-9068-83C8E876DFFF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The CAER team's approach to co-production and co-evalution have been recognised as being innovative and potentially radical in relation to Arts and Humanities research for example the CAER Heritage Project was the overall winner of the NCCPE Engage competition and also won thier category of History and Heritage. The project was chosen from 230 quality entries across the UK, both Arts and Humanities and STEM projects. In the words of one of the judges the CAER project '...really did have it all'. Not only did the project make a profound impact on the community who got involved, it also profoundly changed the researchers, animating their work with new insights and expertise and reconnecting them to the educational mission that drives their work.' Winning this NCCPE award was a remarkable achievement given the number of entries received from across a range of discplines, moreover the CAER team were subsuquently invited to present on co-production strategies to RCUK staff in September 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Co-production Strategies in Arts and
