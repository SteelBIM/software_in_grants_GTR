Tribology</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/J001023/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Tribology is the essential underpinning science of lubrication, friction and wear and therefore is paramount to the efficient operation of numerous mechanical systems such as engines, gearboxes, human joint implants, manufacturing, sustainable energy and ship performance just to name a few. The specific field of green or environment-friendly tribology emphasizes the green or clean technology aspects of wear, friction and lubrication of interacting surfaces in relative motion in numerous mechanical systems. The interaction of these surfaces is of importance for energy or environmental sustainability and has impact upon today's environment. This includes tribological technology that mimics living nature and thus is expected to be environment-friendly, the control of friction and wear that is of importance for energy conservation and conversion (thus emissions and carbon footprint), enhanced manufacturing techniques such as chemical mechanical polishing, environmental aspects of lubrication and surface modification techniques as well as tribological aspects of green applications such as the wind-power and tidal turbines. The area of green tribology will therefore directly affect the economy by reducing waste and extending equipment life, improve the quality of life and will help reduce the carbon footprint of many mechanical systems. It will also help address the need for increased resource responsibility and lower the health risks by creation of legislation compliant surfaces and coatings to replace potential hazardous coatings currently being used. 

The proposal is from a group that is very able to manage the highly innovative and challenging research into the new area of Green Tribology. The group will be able to join various disciplines together that are essential to establishing a multidisciplinary team, namely chemistry, tribology, mechanical engineering, surface science, material science and manufacturing. The grant would focus on developing the right environment for innovative research and new directions to be studied and therefore designs for managing a flexible research portfolio are presented. The research would cover modelling and experimental approaches. The team will build world-leading and disruptive research solutions and demonstrators in green tribo-materials and natural product chemistry, tribo-metrology, tribo-electrochemistry, tribo-smart coatings, tribo-sensing to develop green tribology solutions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The outcomes of this Green Tribology Platform grant will directly benefit a broad range of consumer products associated with automotive (sustainability and durability of vehicles), renewable energy production (marine- and land-based), household appliances, industrial machines and plants, to the healthcare sector by providing green tribology solutions, more energy efficient systems and innovative coatings to allow improved international competiveness, product robustness and market distinction. The grant will facilitate new and improved environmentally friendly products and manufacturing processes, as well as allow the UK to have greater competitiveness in the micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) and tiny-technologies markets. These products and potential spin-out companies formed from the research outcomes will aid wealth creation. The UK industrial community would also by being able to rapidly take a distinctive technological advantage from having a specialised multidisciplinary green tribological research group and facilities able to generate and model unique systems with greater functionality and performance while offering compliance with increasingly strict legislation and demands for sustainability. Thus, the new Green tribology team will accelerate improvements in tribological performances leading to longer life cycles for mechanical systems and accordingly reduced consumption of materials. At the environmental level, it should be expected that there will be reduced energy consumption and the replacement of toxic lubricants by biodegradable and renewable organic substitutes. The Green Tribology research group would also act as a catalyst to simulate research across the UK. The immediate benefit will be to the partner companies of the Green Tribology team and the wider nCATS industrial partners and collaborators listed here: Wartsila, International Paint, Castrol, BAE Systems Surface Ships, Airbus, Chevron Oronite, Daido Industrial Bearings Europe, DePuy International, DSTL, ESR Technology, FAG Aerospace, GE Aviation, Hardide, Lloyd's Register, Mantis Deposition, Micro Materials, Oerilikon Balzers Coating, Phoenix Tribology, Plasma Quest, Rolls-Royce, Rotork Controls, Schlumberger, Score Europe, Shell, TaiCaan Technologies, Teer Coatings, Tribotex, TWI, Vestas, Philips Oral Healthcare, Diamond Hard Surfaces, GKN Aerospace, Smith &amp;amp; Nephew, Kittiwake, TecVac, Element 6, Diamond Detectors Ltd., Transvac and Omega Completions. Every attempt will be made to broaden the impact across the UK throughout the grant period by various methods of disseminating research output and holding workshops and open days. UK industry will benefit by having access to a highly skilled research group and fully equipped laboratories, as well as specialised computational models to allow product design concepts and sub-system performance testing. The likely timeframe for true impact of this research is likely to be up to 10 years due to the novelty involved but immediate improvements in energy efficiency of many tribological systems are anticipated by the end of the grant period.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-09-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1200359</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at the Stephenson conference April 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D274192B-014B-471D-9390-750761B93BDA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of research - Real-time on-board condition monitoring of train axle bearings</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at ICEFA VI in July 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8EB86AB6-3ACF-4339-A234-034432129F28</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of research - Observing early stage rail axle bearing damage</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at ICEFA VII July 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>5B0788BE-1122-4C92-B18C-555C666CB0FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of research - Mapping of Rolling Contact Fatigue in Rail Axel Bearings</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at ICMCF 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9C69CF41-BDE6-4B0C-8F95-382C040A6D5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of research - Drag Dependence on Fouling</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Oral presentation at ICMCF</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C3F4AC97-2423-40BF-BDA7-3F63EBD894FB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dissemination of research - Drag Dependence on Fouling</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>20700</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp;

Train bearings: From the analysis of failed real-life train axle bearings we have started to understand the failure mode of bearings by rolling contact fatigue. These findings will be used to determine a relationship between the damage in the bearings and their vibration signature measured by sensors produced by Perpetuum Ltd and fitted on Southeastern trains. This relationship will be used to monitor the condition of real train axle bearings in order to improve train safety.

Disc drag rotors: A novel benchtop drag measurement technique has been developed using an analytical rheometer. This method is being used to assess the effectiveness of marine antifouling coatings against the growth of micro-organisms or &amp;quot;slime&amp;quot;. Slime causes drag on moving ships, which leads to great wastage of fuel and increases in greenhouse gas emissions. Previous methods of measuring drag have required large, complex and expensive equipment. Commercial marine paint companies can use the developed method to gain insights that will guide their future product development activities, and one manufacturer is sponsoring further research. We have fully met our objectives in developing this method. In future, computer modelling will let us compare the measured drag to the results of real ship trials. 

Acrylic bone cements: Acrylic plastic cements are used in most hip replacement operations to fix the artificial ball joint into the thigh bone. These cements have changed little since they were introduced in the 1960s. We have shown that small changes in the composition of cements can change their physical properties, and are exploring whether any improvements can be made without compromising their good properties. We have shown that we can influence the structure of hardened bone cement by changing the formulation variables, and a student project measured the effect of acrylic monomer changes on cement hardness. An additive has been identified that can influence the dispersion of radiopaque pigments, which could change the wear of artificial hip replacements. Variations in polymer molecular weight have been observed in cements recovered from failed hip joints.

Marine antifouling: The EU FP7 project Foul-X-Spel has resulted in trials of a new low toxicity antifouling coating produced by a novel route in which organic biocides have been chemically linked to polymeric paint binders. No improvement in antifouling properties was observed, but the novel coatings may contribute to reducing drag on ships in service. This could give reduced fuel consumption and lower emissions of greenhouse gases. 

Wind turbines: Wind turbine blades are now so long that the tips move at such high speed that grit and even rain drops in the air can cause damage when the moving blade strikes them. Special polyurethane coatings are applied to the edge of the blades to protect against this. We have used a custom type of sand-blasting rig to measure the effect of particles hitting the blades at different angles. An x-ray CT scanner was used to see damage developing beneath the surface of the coatings before it was visible to the naked eye. We have also shown that the properties of protective coatings change at low temperatures.

Dental cleaning: This work is at the half-way stage. Toothbrushes and abrasive dental particles have been characterised and the key variables likely to affect the efficiency of tooth cleaning have been identified and these are being explored experimentally. 

Low Drag Superhydrophobic Surface. Superhydrophobic surfaces can significantly reduce skin friction drag by supporting a layer of gas on the surface. Previous work showed that electrolysis could be used to prevent displacement and dissolution of this gas film to allow prolonged drag reduction. This current project has focused on developing methods and materials to fabricate large are low drag superhydrophobic surfaces at low cost.

An initial cost analysis of low drag surfaces was undertaken which considered what the minimum coating cost and running costs would have to be less than cost savings in fuel. This analysis showed that if a drag reduction of 20% could be achieved (this is a lower estimate) and a coating cost of &amp;lt; $100 per metre squared and running power of &amp;lt; 100 Watts per metre are obtained then a cost saving of ~12% could be expected. Informed by the cost analysis methods by which to produce surfaces in a cost effective manner were investigated. To make surfaces structured with features on the scale of hundreds of micrometers casting was deemed to be most appropriate. This method requires high precision micromachining to create one mould from which multiple replicas can be cast for little cost. A fabrication process using moulding was developed which uses silicone as the casting material and if materials were bought in bulk could produce 1 meter squared areas for ~ $100. Using appropriate theory and a diffusion model using Comsol Multi physics shows how the role of current density and surface geometry determine the size of the diffusion layer and therefore gas nucleation characteristics. The theory behind the spreading of gas throughout the features is dependant surface geometry and surface energy of the materials. Analysis of these theoretical models informed the geometry of the surface. Sample surfaces were made using the moulding technique to the geometry informed by the theoretical models. The dewetting performance of the surfaces were observed and showed good performance in stationary water. Some improvements to the geometry were identified which could allow more robust performance. 

Secondment Impact:
The Green Tribology grant has given the opportunity to build a strategic collaboration with Perpetuum Ltd and the new University Strategic Research Group (MENSUS). An improved understanding of the failure of rail axle bearings has been achieved and, as a result, 2 papers have been already published and 2 oral presentations have been given at conferences. More work is currently being carried out using the &amp;pound;107,000 of further funding that has been won to support this project and more outputs are forecast. Perpetuum is also in the process of fully funding and building a bearing rig to be housed at the University of Southampton. This rig will give the opportunity to better understand the bearing failure in the train environment and it could also be employed as a demonstrator for technologies in different fields (e.g. wind turbines, marine turtines and tanks).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AD4BBD1D-E34D-40F9-B78C-D102D3CE1168</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Education,Energy,Healthcare,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Train bearings. During the research on train bearings (that is still ongoing) we found out that rail axle bearings fail by rolling contact fatigue. So far it seems that initiation of the failure is due to electrical damage or to a white layer that forms because the bearings in service are overloaded. We are not sure yet which one of these two damages is the initiation cause and how they are related. More bearings removed from service will be analysed to clarify this.

The vibration data measure by the sensor produced by Perpetuum Ltd have been analysed for many good and damaged bearings and we have noticed that the vibrations are affected by:
1) the speed of the train,
2) the loading during turning
3) the conditions of the track, 
4) the conditions of the bearing and 
5) the conditions of the wheel. 
Therefore a correlation between bearing damage and vibration is not straight forward as all these parameter play an effect on it. A study has been carried out eliminating all these variables. The understanding of the failure mode of the bearings could be used by other researchers and by the bearing manufacturer to improve the bearing properties in relation to their environment.

Disc drag rotors: A novel benchtop drag measurement technique using an analytical rheometer to measure the torque on minidiscs (4cm diameter) has been developed. The method is highly reproducible and is able to distinguish between discs fouled in the sea at 2-week intervals. The disc coefficient of momentum was found to correlate with actual surface roughness measured by optical profilometry. This was led to collaboration with a world-leading marine paint manufacturer (Akzo Nobel/International Paint) who will fund further method development. A torque rotor for large (28cm diameter) discs rig has also been constructed and commissioned in collaboration with a KTS placement and a student project. The rotational velocity necessary to cause detachment of macro-fouling organisms from heavily fouled commercial antifouling coatings has been measured. 

Acrylic bone cements: A student project demonstrated that it may be possible to improve the properties of the continuous polymer phase of bone cement by changing acrylic monomer composition. An additive was identified that influences the dispersion of radiopaque pigments in the cement, which could affect wear of artificial hip replacements. Variations in polymer molecular weight have been observed in cements retrieved from surgical revisions.

Wind turbines: Experience on blade leading edge erosion testing was gained through EU Project Windtrust. We have quantified the rate of erosion due to high velocity sand impact on wind turbine blade leading edge protective coatings, and demonstrated that pre-existing erosion caused by sand impact influences subsequent raindrop erosion. We have found that erosion behaviour may change significantly at sub-zero temperatures. These findings will be used by a leading manufacturer of wind turbine blades to improve their product development of leading edge coatings. Approached by Siemens for potential collaborations on blade leading edge testing.

Dental cleaning: PhD project on tooth cleaning technology is underway in conjunction with Glaxo Smith Kline and the UK National Physical Laboratory. Tooth brushes and dental abrasive pigments have been characterised. An existing tribometer has been modified to accept toothbrush heads for abrading tooth surfaces, and a new multi-station rig has been designed.

Marine antifouling: An EU sponsored project (Foul-X-Spel) has resulted in a new way to make low or zero toxicity antifouling paints. No improvement in fouling resistance was observed during the timeframe of the project, but this coating has shown other interesting effects that could result in significant fuel saving for operating ships. These coatings could reduce drag on ships resulting in fuel savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. A PhD study has started which is using a hyperspectral camera to measure slime and marine fouling on ships' hulls when they are in dry dock. This special type of digital camera can measure the colour spectrum of light at individual pixels in the image. The colour is characteristic of particular types of fouling (such as seaweeds) and with the help of a computer the digital images can be used to rapidly calculate the extent of different fouling growths on the hull. This work is being carried out in conjunction with a major marine coatings manufacturer.

A self funded PhD study into lowering friction for lubricated contacts using arrays of laser texturing has shown repeatable benefits of up to 18% lower friction using dimples larger than the line hertzian contact size. By using anisotropic dimple designs differences in directional friction were seen using a reciprocating lubricated line contact. 

A further PhD study looking at modelling and predicting degradation mechanisms of hardmetals used by downhole drilling equipment under abrasion has been developed and validated using classic crack patterns from the literature. Work to incorporate corrosion into the model is underway. This model will be helpful to inform the best microstructure that resist abrasion and thus can increase drilling equipment life. 

A further PhD study into cavitation erosion-corrosion damage rates and mechanisms of marine propulsion alloys (i.e. Cast Nickel aluminium bronze) has shown that selective phase attack of Pre exposed samples can have a large influence on the loss rates. Synergistic effects between mechanical and electrochemical processes have also been quantified.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Feasible research will be used to fuel longer term research funds</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E107EA05-AD22-4447-87A4-78930F1CA980</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/94C3FC36-E7BD-4701-928B-FE68755A0953"><gtr:id>94C3FC36-E7BD-4701-928B-FE68755A0953</gtr:id><gtr:title>Rapid laboratory screening of drag due to slime fouling on marine coatings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/fd94e4cf47476115b07b7ce613d613a1"><gtr:id>fd94e4cf47476115b07b7ce613d613a1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dennington, S.P</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C1DFCF2A-C150-4D45-BF0A-EBAE789297EF"><gtr:id>C1DFCF2A-C150-4D45-BF0A-EBAE789297EF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Wetting of Surfaces Made of Hydrophobic Cavities.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/4d3909cbc6360ea0a8948d5606f93a43"><gtr:id>4d3909cbc6360ea0a8948d5606f93a43</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lloyd BP</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0743-7463</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/C707D181-7D8F-40BD-9C7E-F1872A2F503B"><gtr:id>C707D181-7D8F-40BD-9C7E-F1872A2F503B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Real-time on -board condition monitoring of train axle bearings</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/56b297b92360efab8e523e224b8d7e4b"><gtr:id>56b297b92360efab8e523e224b8d7e4b</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Corni, I</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/4BD15B19-94DC-4E1D-860D-2F574F5B42CC"><gtr:id>4BD15B19-94DC-4E1D-860D-2F574F5B42CC</gtr:id><gtr:title>The neighbourhood environment and use of neighbourhood resources in older adults with and without lower limb osteoarthritis: results from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Clinical rheumatology</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/453076b4616bcce4b2d143c8364e568e"><gtr:id>453076b4616bcce4b2d143c8364e568e</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Timmermans EJ</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:issn>0770-3198</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6E7CBEBF-2E13-49CF-BBF2-0AA9302C1833"><gtr:id>6E7CBEBF-2E13-49CF-BBF2-0AA9302C1833</gtr:id><gtr:title>Miniaturized rotating disc rheometer test for rapid screening of drag reducing marine coatings</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Surface Topography: Metrology and Properties</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a2e593b28a1cf91e1d2cc9e271ddff36"><gtr:id>a2e593b28a1cf91e1d2cc9e271ddff36</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Dennington S</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1FB18D3F-851A-4655-B6FC-543D4FEEDE7D"><gtr:id>1FB18D3F-851A-4655-B6FC-543D4FEEDE7D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Damage mechanisms at the cement-implant interface of polished cemented femoral stems.</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Journal of biomedical materials research.
