Yet there is a danger that policy is being advanced on the basis of very limited evidence ignoring the complexities and challenges involved in transitions from state provided services to spun-out mutual forms and shared ownership. Within this context, this study aims to provide a rigorous evidence base concerning the role of spin-out mutuals in promoting innovation in public services in the UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will examine the process and nature of innovation in public service delivery as enabled by such organisations in health and social services. It will adopt a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies with a detailed study of 30 organisations and their different stakeholders.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The study will examine the different types of innovations observed, identify crucial facilitating factors and barriers to innovations, and assess their effectiveness and impacts as perceived by users and other stakeholders.This will provide a high quality evidence base for spin-out organisations as well as scholars, policy makers and support providers interested in recent spin-out developments.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This proposal has been developed in collaboration with the range of potential users of the findings and originates in their demand for evidence on innovative delivery of public services combined with the identification of gaps in the academic literature. 

Who will benefit? 
- Service providers: these include existing mutuals, those thinking of becoming mutuals
- Service users: these may be bodies representing patients and others users
- Support providers: advisors, professional firms and unions
- Policy makers: national and local level as well as commissioners, advisors , lobby groups and think tanks


How will they benefit?

The research will provide new insights into the types of innovations, the approaches to innovation, challenges, barriers and how these can be overcome. With this information policies can be developed that are based on a rigorous evidence base, with appropriate support provided, an enabling environment created and commissioning that is more responsive. Those providing services will gain better understanding and guidance on how to become more innovative, how to manage innovation and how to manage the risks of innovation. Support providers will be able to develop their products and services to provide more appropriate assistance. The main objective is to encourage those types of innovation that are likely to lead to positive social impacts for users of services. 


What will be done to ensure they benefit?

A Knowledge Exchange Strategy will be developed in partnership with the Knowledge Exchange Hub, ensuring that all users of the research can have an input throughout the research allowing both ideas to be fed into the research design and results to be disseminated. The partnership with the Transition Institute will allow for close working relationships with key stakeholders in the public services innovation field including NESTA, Social Enterprise London, Innovation Unit, OPM, Young Foundation, Local Partnerships as well as other support organisations and professional firms.

An Advisory Group will be established which will shape the research and been a route for sharing the learning. Key stakeholders from different government departments and support organisations have offered to participate already. it would also include academics Professor Pete Alcock Director of TSRC and Professor Stephen Osbourne as well as a representative of IRC. 

Policy briefing papers will also be prepared on a number of topics, drawing out key findings and recommendations. These results will be presented at local and national events to maximise impact. The results will also be prepared in accessible ways for different forms of media, online and the press. 

Engagement with policy makers will be through small policy circles and working with policy teams such as Mutuals Task Force in the Cabinet Office and those working on Right to Provide in the Department of Health. Policy makers in these departments have already expressed their desire to work with this project and letters of support are included. 

Events for linking users with the research findings will be set up at two points in the project, and the project team will participate in other events arranged by other bodies. In particular we will work closely with membership groups such as Employee Ownership Association and Cooperatives UK, both of which are supporting this application (see letters of support). 

We will monitor the impact of the work throughout the project to identify how users of the research are accessing knowledge generated. This will also be of use in demonstrating the impact of this research.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>224922</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Youth Business International (YBI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Unknown</gtr:country><gtr:description>YBI</gtr:description><gtr:id>38ACFEEE-60AF-4048-81B6-85F5035DDA71</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No Outputs yet</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>N/A</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>N/A</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Spain, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:description>INCASI</gtr:description><gtr:id>2282BD5B-3A8E-4D99-85C3-BCB8EA614493</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Each member university of the INCASI consortium will have responsibilities to organise the secondments above (over 500 month-secondments in total) and report to the European Commission on the different work packages and related deliverables that the project comprises.

I. We have engaged with sector experts, frontline organisations and policy makers throughout the life span of the project and beyond:

? A final project event/workshop took place on the 3th March 2014 at the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and was used to share findings and obtain feedback on findings. In total 30 people attended the event with a cross section of case study organisations, social enterprise advisory bodies and policy makers with parts from Cabinet Office and Department of Health.
? On 2013 we were invited to a Spin Out Network's event attended by 50 social enterprise attendees from organisations including the Employee Ownership Association and Social Enterprise UK.
? On March the 6th 2013 the team was invited to share emerging findings from the study at the Cabinet Office. The meeting was attended by policy makers from the Cabinet Office concerned with the mutualisation of public services agenda and the Mutuals Task Force
? Preliminary findings were also shared with the Chief Operating Officer of Big Society Capital on 13th March 2013.

II. We have used social media channels and other media outlets to disseminate our research findings as well as to discuss practical and policy implications of our findings:

? A webinar entitled: 'Innovating social enterprise strategies and approaches' was delivered by Ian Vickers (Co-Applicant) published on June the 20th 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqdKzgaPMBg?dex=8&amp;amp;list=PLQZ9ucOSQNXvxrkl10eOowAHIo4IDo7gq&amp;amp;spfreload=10
? A blog in Civil Society entitled 'Innovation Beyond the Spin' was prepared by Dan Gregory (Associate Consultant), published on 8th April 2014. http://www.civilsociety.co.uk/finance/blogs/content/17286/innovation_beyond_the_spin?topic=?int=1


III. A range of research outputs have been developed based on our findings and disseminated in different formats. This includes power point presentations (6), reports (2), policy briefings (2) and conference papers (4):

? Four conference papers (all leading onto academic manuscripts) have been produced by different members of the research team. All of them were presented at the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts's event (see above) and three have also been presented at international conferences:

- 'User Engagement and Hybridity: The case of public service social enterprises' (led by C. McMullin), presented at the Policy &amp;amp; Politics Conference, September 2014
- 'Innovation in Public Service Spin-outs: Forms, Processes and Learning' (led by I. Vickers), presented at the Institute of Small Business and Entrepreneurship Conference, November 2014
- 'Organisational cultures and innovation in hybrids: the case of public service spin-outs' (led by F. Lyon), presented at the 30th EGOS Colloquium: Sub-theme 48, July 2014
- 'Public Sector Spin-outs: To what extent a new form of business organisation' (led by L. Sepulveda), presented at the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts's event (see above).</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>830A840F-A6C4-4FE6-B8CC-510B765DC64A</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The aim of the project has been to examine the extent and nature of innovation in public service delivery as enabled by spin-out mutual forms of organisation in health and social care services. The research drew on interview and other evidence from 30 spin-out organisations in the health, social care and fitness/leisure sectors in England. Innovations were examined in terms of the processes and outcomes of designing, developing and introducing novel responses to health and well-being service needs. 

An innovation common to all 30 social enterprises has been the adoption of new organisational forms, with the transition from the public sector often involving high levels of staff engagement. The research identified a further 134 specific innovations, with their main characteristics captured by the following typology:
? Organisational (13% of the innovations) - new forms to empower staff and communities/service users and to increase organisational flexibility and business growth.
? Improvements to existing systems and services (37%) - often driven by immediate financial (cost cutting) and operational efficiency considerations in the new, more competitive context.
? New treatments and well-being services (38%) - often driven by the need for preventative approaches in order to reduce reliance on expensive acute treatments. 
? Outreach and social marketing (12%) - new ways of communicating health and well-being messages and services within diverse community settings.

It was felt that 43% of these innovations could not have happened in the public sector, often due to a combination of reasons such as bureaucratic obstacles, risk averseness and lack of support. In terms of novelty, 16% of the innovations appeared to be 'completely novel', with the rest being either new to the market or area, or just new to the organisation.
Our research found a number of key facilitating factors for innovation in support of more effective organisational functioning and service delivery. These include:
? The development of a culture for encouraging innovation - particularly through involving staff, service users and being open to new knowledge from various sources. 
? Capabilities and competences - including the ability to create 'open learning' environments while balancing the commercial objectives of running an enterprise, and keeping a focus on social value. 
? Creating space for experimentation and risk. This requires tolerance and readiness to learn, including from failure. 
? Partnership working - this was found particularly with other public sector health/social care providers, charities and the voluntary sector. 
? Financing innovation - social enterprises were able to draw on their own reserves, profits or surpluses, as well as external fundraising, public service commissioners, and grants and awards.

Conclusions

Social enterprises and mutual organisations that have spun out from the public sector are an important new space for innovation. Our research shows how processes of innovation have been strongly linked to the involvement of multiple stakeholders including staff, users, commissioners and networks/infrastructures related to public service innovation. While innovation has been shown to be faster and easier in spin-out social enterprises compared to the public sector, some of the most innovative elements identified were developed by maverick leaders and staff with innovative ideas while within the public sector. The concept of mutuality remains contested - while the organisations may have had an element of staff and user involvement in governance, the greater role of staff and users in many decisions was still an emerging ambition in many of these new social enterprises. Only two of the organisations identified with the term mutual.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Policy development, academic research and practices by organisations.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>50A1DEFB-D3EF-4F61-B36D-068E230DD477</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.esrc.ac.uk/my-esrc/grants/ES.J008435.1/read</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Dance to Health - a falls prevention dance programme</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D674DDE2-EB14-4046-981F-37AB438A79AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>High level research discussion attended by the Health Minister and several other policy makers nationally.
