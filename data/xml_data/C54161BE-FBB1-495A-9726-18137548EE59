Perspectives on the adaptations of immigrants in Britain</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/K009206/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>The adaptation of immigrants (the immigrants' long-term integration into British society, and British society's response to it) has become an important topic of academic inquiry and debate among policy makers and the general public. Yet there is little systematic research or unified understanding of this process within and across these different arenas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to investigate the commonalities and differences in the various perceptions and understandings of adaptation and try to reconnect them. This will be done by using an original research design that will examine:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;the multidimensionality of immigrant adaptation in British academia (via a meta-analysis of the current literature and quantitative analysis of secondary data).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Which will be contrasted with the subjective understandings and perceptions of adaptation in Britain among:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>policy makers and third-sector stakeholders (via an analysis of policy documents and interviews)&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>minority and majority groups among the British population (via focus groups).&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>This project will seek an active involvement by academic and non-academic audiences. It will provide a thorough and updated understanding of immigrant adaptation and its dimensionality in Britain, reaching beyond academic and policy circles, with the aim to build a solid evidence base for future research and policy.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The non-academic beneficiaries of this research are as wide-ranging as the academic beneficiaries. They include individuals and organisations interested in issues related to immigrant adaptation, ethnic minorities, intergroup relations and social cohesion such as:

(1)Government departments, agencies, and groups
The findings from all three streams of the project will form an important evidence base for review, discussion, and policy formulation for government departments, agencies, and groups such as the Cabinet Office, the Home Office, the Departmen and the All Party Parliamentary Group on Race and Community. The topic under investigation fits nicely within the recent integration narrative highlighted by the government and deals with an important aspect shaping the level of social cohesion in Britain and will have an important impact at the national level. 

(2)Local governments
The project directly feeds into local governments' equalities and integration aims and will allow situating the state of immigrant adaptation at the local level via the policy and the public's perspectives. Dissemination efforts and collaboration will be undertaken with local government organisations such as Bristol City Council's Equalities and Community Cohesion Team; the Black and Minority Ethnic Services of the Glasgow City Council; and Manchester City Council's Multi Agency for Refugee Integration in Manchester.

(3)Politicians and public servants
Individual politicians and senior public servants at both levels of government interested in the issues above will also benefit from the project's output and will be sought for participation in the project's advisory board and data collection.

(4)National and local organisations, such as charities and think tanks
These beneficiaries, who have important policy clout, will be actively involved in the design and implementation of the project and will benefit from an updated evidence base on the state of immigrant adaptation in British academia, policy, and public circles. Close collaborations and results dissemination will also be undertaken with organisations such as the Runnymede Trust; the Joseph Rowntree Foundation; the Equality and Human Rights Commission; Integrate Bristol; the Govan and Craigton Integration Network (Glasgow); and Refugee Action (Manchester).

(5)Policy and organisational networks
Communication and collaboration will be sought from cross-arena networks such as the UK Race and Europe Network, the Equality and Diversity Forum; the international Cities of Migration networks; the Metropolis network; and Glasgow's Refugee, Asylum and Migration Network. Involvement with such networks will allow to forge new links and widely disseminate results. 

(6)Majority and minority groups within the wider public
The research undertaken by this project will have direct relevance for the general public interested in the topic, from the participants of the focus groups to the members of organisations mentioned above and members of the public affected by the project's dissemination efforts. The project will seek to actively involve the public in the discussion of immigrant adaptation in an ethical and respectful manner and seek to raise awareness of the nuances in the public's views on adaptation from 'the bottom up' to governmental and third sector stakeholders.

The detailed plan and schedule for impact can be found in the Pathways to Impact document. It does involve a strong beneficiary involvement throughout the project and a concrete dissemination plan, including the maintenance of a website; inclusion of policy-oriented beneficiaries on the project advisory board; seeking active feedback through an integrated workshop; the organisation of a final conference for the beneficiaries; and the production of a final research report and research brief for dissemination via the above-mentioned organisation</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>253545</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of North Carolina</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:department>University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Rahsaan Maxwell (member of project advisory board)</gtr:description><gtr:id>1B9590F9-99B9-46B9-B1D8-E01CD2C2002B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>No output as of yet, but plan to have paper and panel at APSA annual meeting in September 2016.

As explained in another section of the form, the research arising from the placement at the Runnymede Trust has been used in a government report on social mobility and child poverty, and preliminary results were also included in an ESRC research briefing (which undoubtedly also had some non-academic impact). Moreover, the dissemination outputs generated for the final project events were distributed online and to the participants. The final project event in London was advertised among many networks; it generated discussion with members of the public, academics, and different organisations during the event and via Twitter. It also prompted interest for further collaboration from academic and non-academic colleagues. Findings from the research will also be submitted to relevant parliamentary commissions related to integration in the near future.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0B86C46D-FE99-4351-AD18-1C2EF50FE75B</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The results from the research, which adopted a multidisciplinary and mixed methods approach, generated rich data and knowledge about the different perceptions of the long-term settlement experiences of immigrants and their descendants (i.e. their adaptation) in the UK in three spheres. 
(1) Academic sphere
Results, which focussed on examining academic approaches to adaptation, and using different methodological techniques to look at the issue, suggest that adaptation includes specific dimensions, rather than being a uni-dimensional phenomenon. Moreover, different dimensions link and group in a specific way for different individuals, with culture being an important differentiator. There are thus specific groupings of adaptation outcomes that ought to be considered in conjunction. There is also some evidence that adaptation varies by ethnicity and country of birth, with UK-born individuals generally showing levels of adaptation more in line with theoretical expectations, despite persisting group inequalities. With regard to the terminology used in academic literature, preliminary findings suggest that a discourse based on 'integration' has been more prominently featured on research on the topic, especially in recent years. 
(2) Policy sphere
Analyses of elite interviews with policy stakeholders show that understandings of adaptation (in this sphere, the term integration was used, given the broader applicability of the term) are quite complex, and emphasise a dimensionality, dynamism, and multi-directionality of the process, with a strong emphasis on issues of diversity and culture. Main themes of discussion about adaptation can be found, but these greatly overlap. With regard to policy, the research suggests that despite views that localised strategies are more suitable to deal with adaptation, national strategies (and funding) remain important. Analyses of Hansard debates show that issues linked to adaptation are of a cyclical nature in parliamentary debates, with most focus on asylum seekers and refugees, but also linked to more established groups.
(3) Public sphere
Data about perceptions was collected via focus groups conducted in Manchester and Glasgow. Results show that perceptions of adaptation are, in theory, based on the idea of a two-way process, where acceptance of difference and diversity as well as mixing are perceived as important, but where most of the onus is being put on migrants (which is a general trend found in other parts of the research). In practice, however, the boundaries between diversity and conformity, acceptance and rejection seem hard to establish and manage. Individual, societal, and structure struggles appear to be important barriers to achieving adaptation. Moreover, analyses of online survey data suggest that cultural and social dimensions of adaptation as well as national origins matter the most when evaluating the adaptation of migrants. 

The project thus generated an important knowledge base for the further understanding of adaptation, with an emphasis on the importance of investigating adaptation in a multi-dimensional and dynamic fashion. This was disseminated to academic and non-academic audiences alike. Various methods and data were used by the project, which helped build the research skills and networks for the PI and the people involved in the project.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>It is believed that the knowledge generated by the research will most likely be taken forward by academic and non-academic audiences. With regard to academic audiences, the data, results and methods associated with the project will be widely disseminated via various academic channels (publications, conferences, data deposit, research blogs, etc.). With regard to non-academic audiences, it is expected that results generated by the research will be useful to government, the third sector, and the general public. Whenever possible, findings from the projects have been made available on the project website (and will continue to do so) and have been disseminated via established networks. They will, whenever appropriate, also be used to produce research blogs as well as provide evidence to governmental bodies.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9B123C68-407D-4B9D-BD36-457C2F0BBF4B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>https://blog.bham.ac.uk/unity-out-of-diversity</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>DNS workshops</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>57056834-F721-41B5-95B1-83162399EEA0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Discovering Neighbourhood Statistics workshops (March and October 2015) influenced the skills levels of employees in third sector organisations and the general public.
