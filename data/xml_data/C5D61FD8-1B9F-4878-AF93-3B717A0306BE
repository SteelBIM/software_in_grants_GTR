One of the most serious recent challenges to this 'truth-conditional' paradigm comes from a certain class of context-sensitive expressions, which we call 'C-expressions'. Context-sensitive expressions are expressions whose interpretation can vary across conversational contexts. Paradigm examples include pronouns: what information is conveyed in uttering 'She won a medal' depends on which female is most salient in the context. In addition there is a range of expressions - C-expressions - whose interpretation seems to depend on context, but which are such that no particular way of analysing their context-sensitivity seems to capture all the data. These include epistemic expressions ('might'), evaluative expressions ('beautiful'), and vague expressions ('rich'). There is a robust body of data that C-expressions behave differently from paradigm context-sensitive expressions in discourse (dis)agreements and in various complex linguistic constructions. For instance, a prototypical use of C-expressions is to manage speakers' assumptions about the very features of context on which their interpretation intuitively depends. If you say 'It might be raining' and I reply 'No, it can't be raining', we aren't disagreeing about whether the possibility of rain is compatible with the information each of us accepts. We disagree about whether to accept information that is compatible with rain. Many recent authors have appealed to the distinctive linguistic behaviour of C-expressions to support radical claims about the nature of linguistic understanding, content, communication, and truth. Our Project investigates whether these claims are well-motivated. 

Most work to date on C-expressions has been piecemeal. The aim of our Project is to conduct a systematic investigation of the full range of C-expressions, and assess the relative merits of rival classical and revisionary frameworks for theorising about them. We will examine what the apparent differences among C-expressions and paradigm context-sensitive expressions amount to precisely. We will then investigate whether these differences can be explained in terms of independently attested aspects of conventional meaning and general conversational principles. Better understanding the meaning and use of C-expressions promises to illuminate more general issues concerning the varieties of context-sensitivity in natural language, the relation between truth and meaning, and the role of context in communication and collaborative action.

A distinctive contribution of our Project is its methodology. The PI and Co-I will engage in 'adversarial collaboration', a method that has proved fruitful in the psychological/social sciences but has rarely if ever been employed in philosophy or linguistics. The PI and Co-I hold different views, coming into the project, about whether explaining the meaning and use of C-expressions calls for a shift in the overall framework of semantic theory. We will develop a list of critical issues in the debate between classical and revisionary approaches to C-expressions. We will then agree on procedures for testing our theories' respective predictions. The results will be published as joint papers, with both the PI and Co-I given space to express their potentially divergent views. Two high-profile interdisciplinary Workshops will be integral in assessing the Team's adversarial collaborations. The Project's integration of multiple methodologies makes it of interest not only to philosophers and linguists, but also to computer scientists and psychologists. The Project constitutes a concrete example of how philosophical theorising can be reshaped by formal and scientific advancements, and, in turn, empirically informed philosophical investigation can feed back into the scientific study of natural language.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our Project investigates the nature of context-sensitivity in natural language by examining the meaning and use of a target class of theoretically recalcitrant expressions ('C-expressions'). The Project is highly theoretical. Though it is often difficult with highly theoretical research to generate impact outside academia directly, our Project enjoins a collaborative interdisciplinary approach which naturally inspires broader impact. For instance, the Project's research outcomes are directly relevant for certain work in artificial intelligence, law, social theory and public policy. Advancements in these areas have natural implications for impact outside academia - in particular, on producers and consumers of human-computer technologies, policy makers and the wider public (see Pathways to Impact for specific steps).

The PI's research on C-expressions emphasises the connection between the discourse behaviour of C-expressions and more general ways people manage their assumptions about context in collaborative action. This research is directly relevant to work in artificial intelligence on natural language processing (NLP). Better understanding the role of context in interpretation - how speakers exploit their mutual grammatical knowledge, information about the conversational situation, and general abductive reasoning skills to interpret one another - can be instrumental in addressing various major tasks in NLP, as concerning anaphora resolution (determining which words refer to the same objects), discourse analysis (identifying discourse relations among sentences), and word-sense disambiguation (delimiting the space of possible interpretations in a given context). The Project's investigation of vague language, a particular class of C-expression, is especially pertinent here. These connections open up exciting possibilities for engineering developments in human-computer interactions. This can lead to material technological advancements, as in word processing, information management, and speech recognition, among others, impacting industry workers and the general public.

The Project's inquiry into the mutual interactions between context and interpretation can also impact theory and practice in fields such as law and public policy. Language used in legal contexts and public policy discourse raises questions of more general interest investigated by the Project. How do vague uses of language and precisifications of vague language shape the interpretation (and possible reinterpretation) of previous and subsequent uses? Does the content of normative or vague language depend on features of the context of use, or on features of the context of interpretation? How do attitudes presupposed in normative uses of language shape the common ground? The Project's answers to these questions bear directly on (e.g.) the interpretation of legal texts, the relation between legal language and the content of the law, and the (often implicit) mechanisms of propaganda and discrimination in social and political discourse. These connections and applications have not been carefully explored. 

The Project aims to increase capacity by developing students' specific skills, knowledge and contacts. Students will be assisted in utilising these resources to promote impact outside academia. Both undergraduate and graduate students will be invited to Project Workshops and actively encouraged to contribute. Supplementary student-only Q&amp;amp;A sessions with the speakers and master classes with the Project Advisory Board will provide open forums for students to examine broader applications of the research for other disciplines and extra-academic domains. Students will be encouraged to pursue these applications in their future endeavours. Such student engagement will be instrumental in promoting future impact beyond academia.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>195907</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participated in the 2016 Deontic Logic and Normative Systems Conference (DEON 2016)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F3018011-FF1B-4E73-98C2-6FD58046D210</gtr:id><gtr:impact>I participated in the weeklong biannual 2016 Deontic Logic and Normative Systems conference on &amp;quot;Reasons, Argumentation and Justification&amp;quot; in Bayreuth, Germany.
