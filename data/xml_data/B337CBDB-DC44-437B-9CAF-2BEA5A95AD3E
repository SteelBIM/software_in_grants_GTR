But in East Africa, less than 1/3 of pupils possess basic literacy skills. Ugandan children perform the worst; only 44.5 percent pass basic literacy tests. Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) data from a Research Triangle Institute survey in northern Uganda in 2009 indicated that 82% of P2 pupils could not read a single word in the local language, compared to 51% of P2 pupils in the central region. Similar to other African countries there are many problems in Uganda's education system, including undertrained teachers, lack of materials and quality methods for teaching literacy, non-existent systems for tracking pupil performance, and parents, communities and local officials that lack the know-how to support and advocate for their children's education. Despite strong mother tongue education policies, due to underdeveloped orthographies and a lack of materials in many languages, implementing successful mother tongue literacy programs poses a significant challenge for African countries, including Uganda. While many educational interventions and literacy programs have been implemented in Africa, impacts have been minimal overall; moving to scale has also proven problematic as program effects reduce further.
Since 2010 Mango Tree, a private, locally owned educational tools company, has been piloting a successful early literacy project in one language community in northern Uganda. The main goals of the Mango Tree program include increasing literacy rates, enhancing education quality through improved, effective materials and teachers, and fostering a culture of reading among pupils, parents and communities within a cost-effective and scalable framework. Compelling evidence for the large benefits and cost-effectiveness of the intervention comes from a pilot randomized evaluation of the program conducted by University of Michigan researchers in 2013 and 2014. 
The Literacy Laboratory Project (LLP) will scale up and evaluate the Mango Tree literacy program, whose model delivers better-quality teacher instruction, access to relevant literacy materials, inclusive approaches to learner assessment, parental and community engagement in schools and strengthening literacy infrastructure so that reading and writing, especially in local languages, becomes a meaningful part of daily life in households and communities. This scale-up will test a piloted and improved model to evaluate its effectiveness and test the mode of program delivery. Under the LLP, researchers from the University of Michigan will conduct a rigorous randomized control trial of the program in the Lango Sub-region over 4 years to measure the effectiveness of the instructional model, teacher training and support supervision innovations and literacy materials and methods on Primary 1- Primary 3 pupils' literacy achievement and explore public-private avenues for scale-up. We will study 128 schools, which are randomly assigned to either the full LLP implemented by Mango Tree's field officers, a partial-program implemented by Government Teacher Tutors, or a control group. The study will also randomize instructional materials to evaluate their contribution to effective teaching. The study will collect a rich set of pupil, parent, teacher, classroom, and school-level longitudinal data. Learning will be measured principally in terms of improvements in EGRA and Early Grade Writing Assessment scores.
Our goals are to: 1) demonstrate that big effects on learning are possible (as the 2013 pilot evaluation results point toward); 2) show that with the right combination of training, teaching and learning materials and correct support, teachers can be supported to effectively teach literacy - even in rural, under-resourced, overcrowded classrooms; and 3) to test and evaluate economic approaches to implementation at scale to determine value-for-money impacts on pupil learning and teacher performance in African schools.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Numerous literacy projects have been implemented in Africa and Uganda. Of the few that have been rigorously evaluated, the average program effects are low, yielding effects less than 0.20 standard deviation (sd) gains in learning. In contrast, results for Mango Tree's (MT's) program suggest very large effects - preliminary results from a 2013 pilot find an average gain in over one sd in letter recognition after one year of the program among Primary 1 students. 
This evaluation allows for the comparison of the effectiveness of MT's model with other similar programs in Uganda and Africa and will contribute to the body of available knowledge and inform effective modes of scaling up. MT has been developing and testing its' model and materials with government officials and teachers since 2009; its model is more advanced than others (as it has gone through piloting, small scale up and revisions) and ready for a large evaluation. We will use results to promote dialogue among policy makers and implementers about what works, what doesn't and why in literacy programming, with the goal of improving primary literacy interventions and helping decision-makers and practitioners align scarce resources with the most impactful programming possible. Results will be used to design standardized packages for scale up that allow the average school and teacher to access and successfully implement a literacy model at minimum cost and maximum impact.
Direct beneficiaries include: 1) 75,000 Primary 1 (P1), P2 and P3 pupils in government-supported primary schools; 2) 800 P1-P3 teachers in government-supported primary schools; 3) 150,000 parents of P1-P3 pupils. Indirect beneficiaries include: 1) siblings of P1-P3 pupils; 2) 500,000 members of Leblango-speaking communities; 3) the Lango Language Board, a local body responsible for promoting the Leblango language and culture; 4) government institutions (Ministry of Education and Sports, National Curriculum Development Centre, local education officials, primary teachers colleges); 5) education civil society organizations. Since 2009, MT has been regularly engaging these partners through quarterly and annual results-sharing events in schools, communities and government offices; they receive project updates, attend results dissemination and reflection workshops and participate in routine feedback and planning meetings. At the start of the project, a stakeholder workshop will be held in Kampala and Lira to disseminate results from the 2013 and 2014 pilot evaluation and present plans for the 2015-2018 project period.
Results will be shared with stakeholders, program implementers and policy/decision-makers. We will produce reports, journal articles, presentations, media (newspaper, internet, local radio and television), advocacy videos and other results-sharing documentation to disseminate through local channels and conferences in Uganda and abroad. These events provide an opportunity to share results and advocate for effective scale up of our methods with other practitioners and government officials, and reflect on ways to improve teacher and classroom practice to generate the best learning outcomes possible for the majority of pupils. In addition to publication of findings, we will also use our (expected) successes to advocate for our strategies to be tested and implemented elsewhere in Uganda and throughout East Africa. In many places in East Africa, demand for mother tongue education is low due to the perception that introducing children to instruction in local language will hinder their ability to learn international languages, such as English, which are keys to success. By demonstrating that local language instruction can in fact lead to better results in English, we will generate public and political demand for mother tongue education and replication of successful interventions that have proven effective in raising literacy levels at low cost and large scale.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1009396</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>We created student benchmarking videos to show parents, communities, teachers, school leaders and education officials what good reading and writing growth should look like for children in early primary grades.

These videos have been shown at teacher trainings, meetings with parents, engagements with government officials, during workshops and presentations, and at advocacy events to demonstrate what children can do when exposed to an appropriate literacy programme that methodically grows their skills and develops their abilities over time. The videos have elicited excitement and engagement on the part of audiences as children go from reading nothing in term 1 of Primary 1 to reading long stories by the end of Primary 3. They have also helped improve people's understanding of reading growth and progression and what schools and parents should expect of a child who is learning to read and growing into an independent and confident reader.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Student Benchmarking Videos</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-JYU0Gfbsg</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>When we communicate results to rural (many of them illiterate or semi-literate) audiences, we use situations and examples to explain difficult information that makes sense in their daily lives and local environment. Rather than present data and information in a series of numbers, figures, tables and graphs, we share information using agricultural metaphors to explain to parents how their children are performing in key literacy tasks.

Using a series of tree images, each one corresponding to a different level of performance, we share complex information about student achievement in key literacy competencies. As our parents are nearly all rural farmers, we explain the 'inputs' required to help their children grow and thrive - weeding becomes school engagement, watering becomes the provision of school supplies and feeding, and sunshine becomes home learning and reading.

In order to make their child - their seedling - grow, all of these inputs are critical to their success and to making them 'bear fruit' on their path to literacy. By explaining these concepts to parents in this way, they are able to engage in dialogue about their children's performance in a 'language' they know and understand.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E36C15DC-C679-41ED-9FA7-C438F450C1BC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>We have not yet begun to scale up the literacy report card, but we have received incredibly strong feedback from the parents we piloted the initiative with. The overwhelming response was that parents preferred this method of conveying pupil grades and wanted all report cards to be like this in the future. They appreciated the effort to change the way termly marks are done because most of them are illiterate, or at the very least the current marks don't make intuitive sense to them. Parents freely used agricultural metaphors to explain how they hoped to help their child: pruning, fertilizer, weeding, watering. They were very engaged. Parents also liked receiving the report cards in person from the teachers rather than their child bringing them home from school, indicating they get more from the face-to-face interaction. Making big data work for multiple audiences is a complex process requiring time, energy and commitment on the part of everyone in your research team. However, there are a few things we have learned about downstream results communication that may help others share information with their local partners in a simple and engaging way:

1. Make it relevant: Big data must be relevant to the people receiving it. It must be important to them and to their lives and work in order for them to consider it important enough to discuss and understand. 

2. Make it accessible: Big data must be broken down into a series of manageable chunks for it to be useful. Presentation is critical in helping big data tell its own story. Different audiences often need the same information presented in very different ways.

3. Make it actionable: What we learn from our research must lead to changes in policy and practice. In order for results to make sense to the audiences we share them with, they must be structured in a way that allows recipients to take action and change behaviours that will lead to better lives, systems and polices.

Downstream sharing should be a key feature of any results-sharing initiative. By planning for it in your studies and making the people you collect data from central to your impact process, the evidence we gather really can transform lives and turn research into real time practice.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Literacy Report Card for Parents</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artistic/Creative Exhibition</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.theimpactinitiative.net/blog/blog-impact-whom-making-big-data-work-little-guys</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>blog #2 - Feb 2017</gtr:description><gtr:form>Engagement focused website, blog or social media channel</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>889D577F-7A83-424C-AEF8-71CDE0D2B33C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>blog on using data from our RCT</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.theimpactinitiative.net/blog/blog-impact-whom-making-big-data-work-little-guys</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Conference - London experimental week</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>301B6BD7-AE90-47AA-BBF4-09FA792AC29E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Discussion and presentation</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Endline Data Collection - Nov 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>79F2215F-345E-4EBE-AEC3-422193EC3F80</gtr:id><gtr:impact>12 teams comprised of 171 people visited 158 schools in 8 districts to conduct digital data collection in P1-P4 classes.

Mango Tree implements the project studied by the University of Illinois in this RCT. Mango Tree developed a mother tongue literacy program for Primary 1-Primary 3 (P1-P3) pupils. In 2009, it received funding to implement its model in 8 government schools in northern Uganda, later expanding to 11 schools in 2011. In 2013, only having the budget to implement the full program in 12 schools, Mango Tree partnered with researchers to conduct a small RCT with an additional 26 comparison schools. After one year, the effects on letter recognition were over 8 times larger than other randomized trials in low-income countries. In 2014, the evaluation was scaled to 158 schools, funded until 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A74A07D9-682A-4858-B416-385B5FF1C27D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Based upon these results, Mango Tree has reshaped its education portfolio and agenda, evolving its works over time to continue asking questions about what makes an effective teacher and a successful education system in Africa. Other organizations have come to Mango Tree seeking similar advice, hiring the company's experts to develop additional literacy programs for primary and secondary schools across the country. This experience has caused Mango Tree to reflect heavily on its work and redesign its education strategy to focus on new areas of classroom instruction and teacher effectiveness that heavily shape the literacy outcomes of students in rural, under-resourced African settings.</gtr:impact></gtr:spinOutOutput></gtr:spinOutOutputs></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/M004996/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:parents><gtr:parent><gtr:id>B337CBDB-DC44-437B-9CAF-2BEA5A95AD3E</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/M004996/1</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>1009396.21</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2015-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:children><gtr:child rel="Transfer"><gtr:id>7B1787EB-5685-469A-A8DD-EE49EF2FEE04</gtr:id><gtr:grantRef>ES/M004996/2</gtr:grantRef><gtr:amount>822418.51</gtr:amount><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:end>2019-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:children/></gtr:child></gtr:children></gtr:parent></gtr:parents></gtr:projectHierarchy><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>34457363-5AFA-40BF-BBA6-71DB708DF181</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Curriculum areas</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D4B9AE9-278F-4867-8D5E-31631698729E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Development economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>7D5D2DB2-0A64-42AF-A644-5F541B832A29</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>64564C94-AC7F-4056-903D-0AED107A359E</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Education</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BE2E53E-4358-4EDC-9E31-723C873EE26A</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Labour economics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
