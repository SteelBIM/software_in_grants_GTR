The rise of the 'anytime' 24 hour society has led to increased consumption of goods and services, the take-up of non-standard work schedules (e.g., rotating shifts), and a more dynamic approach to activity planning, leading to the constant 'hectic' pace of life many of us feel. Coupled to this is how laptops, smart phones and PDAs, linked to 'social networking' have revolutionized when, where and how people communicate in work and at home, softening 'time' and 'space', allowing social relationships to revolve around the appreciation of the relativity of friends and colleagues in personal time.

Under these circumstances, trip making behaviour to engage in these activities can be very complex, favouring single occupancy car use over more carbon efficient alternatives and resulting in mean travel distances increasing despite the time allocated to travel remaining relatively consistent. The car is highly compatible with society's current scheduling patterns and alternative modes are often not considered as their use requires additional cognitive effort which often removes them from the decision making set.

Our research vision is to understand the extent to which behavioural change in transport habits and practices can be facilitated through the creation of a new form of 'transport network', based on extending social networking principles to transport users and their individual vehicles. Through the development of an innovative, open, extensible technical platform called 6th Sense Transport (6ST), we will provide users with new ways of understanding the relationships between their own future transport plans and those of others. 

This approach could revolutionise the process of decision making in travel behaviour (whether it be for the movement of people or things) by using social networking principles to create 'visibility' of potential transport options in time and space. If we are better able to visualise the activity of people and things (cars, buses, lorries, even items within a lorry) relative to their immediate and future time schedules, and crucially, the conditions under which people and other 'things' might be willing to liaise and adapt, we might be able to realise more opportunistic and collaborative uses for transport resources, leading to a reduction in overall transport related carbon emissions. 

6ST will provide a deep understanding of how the increasingly multiple forms of temporality and spatiality influence travel mode choices and the ways in which people and 'things' might be willing to share certain personal travel information. This will be achieved through the novel use of smart phone and tagging technology to provide data feeds on activity and availability, monitored through a Platform that will anticipate opportunities for connections that are then made visible to users in the social network.

Experiments in how potential users of a 6ST system might adapt, alter and collaborate in their travel behaviour, with the visibility of potential transport options afforded by the Platform, will be undertaken in three specific domains: Tourism (in relation to visitor communities on campsites), Primary Education (in relation to child drop-off and collection) and Urban Logistics (space availability and utilisation on delivery/collection vehicles).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from 6ST?

Those who will immediately benefit from this research include user-groups associated with the three experimental domains. In urban logistics this primarily involves transport managers of freight and service companies (carriers, freight forwarders, shippers and amenity companies), scheduling daily rounds for their vehicle fleets. In primary education, users are also collaborators with potential to bring about 'behavioural change' and include, parents transporting pupils to and from school, pupils, head teachers, school eco-councils, governor committees, site managers, local authority 'routes for schools' and schools transport officers, local education authorities and community police. In tourism the main beneficiaries are tourists (the end users), but also local transport providers, visitor attractions, local tourism associations and ultimately local residents. 

How will users benefit from 6ST?
 
Of key benefit to users will be the ability to positively alter their transport behaviours (reducing CO2, enhancing quality of life and reducing travel costs) through the visibility of more sustainable and timely transport options afforded by the creation of a 'transport network', based on extending social networking principles to transport users and their individual vehicles. 6ST enables users to visualise the relationships between their own future transport plans and those of others as well as the ability to create their own applications to engage with current, and anticipate new travel connections in the network through the 6ST Platform. Beyond the timescale of the project, as a growing mass of users participate, there is potential to expand the scale of the impact into other domains (e.g. work, retail travel). Specific benefits to the users in the three experimental domains are:

Urban Logistics:

 i) reduced fleet mileage and fuel costs for logistics companies enabled by visualisation of future 'back-loading' opportunities ii) improved optimisation of out-bound and in-bound vehicle rounds resulting from a greater understanding of time constraints and vehicle capacity across fleet schedules of iii) visualisation of inventory on vehicles to enable smarter load sharing and parts distribution for companies iv) the ability to demonstrate 'green' travelling planning to local authorities in terms of both fleet and employee transport v) logistics companies able to customise their own applications by embedding 6SL into their business management tools to reduce operating costs.

Primary Education:

 i) Reduced congestion around schools during peak hours through parents/guardians engaging in more collaborative travel choices through the improved schedule visibility provided by 6ST ii) improved child safety (both in terms of reduced accident probability but also travel opportunity awareness for the school, parents, guardians, children) iii) enhanced quality-of-life (e.g. for parents with unpredictable work patterns) through the knowledge on future travel options provided by 6SL iv) enhanced community adhesion through the linkages and transport connections provided by the 6ST network.

Tourism:

 i) Reduced tourist vehicle activity between camping sites and local visitor attractions through enhanced visibility of shared transport options ii) more efficient supply chain activity serving tourists at campsites through collective visibility of needs (potential for shared purchasing) iii) greater security, health and well being from the knowledge of potential transport linkages available in the community iv) contribution to green travelling planning policies for camp sites and visitor attractions.

One key research and professional skill being acquired by the project team includes enhancing capabilities to link research with policy, effectively strengthening the project's impact.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2011-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>729923</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>The 'classic' American road movie was both an emblem of achieving and escaping from the American Dream.The car, the road and the hero are the holy trinity of American cinema. But what would a convincing UK road movie look like? What architecture would it traverse today? How would the plot develop if it were constructed from the shapes and patterns of the ubiquitous data collected from ANPR technology? What would its journey tell us if the data were combined with how researchers approach and analyse the data?
 
'The Car That Turned' is in a sense a very British road movie - one whose structure is derived from the patterns that emerge from data collected by the UK's ANPR system, and whose on-screen narrative merges co-ordinates with the inferences drawn by human analysis - a 21st century version of Mass Observation, collecting information to understand to control and improve, and if that fails, to make do and mend'.

He proposes that flows are understood by the purposeful, repetitive, programmable sequences of exchange and interaction between physically disjointed positions held by social actors in the economic, political and symbolic structures of society. Therefore we can define flows as consisting of three elements - the medium through which things flow, the things that flow, and the nodes among which the flows circulate. 'Flows' interprets these three elements through the A354's ANPR cameras, CO2 emission ratings data and vehicles.

'Flows' scans registration plates in real-time across the six camera sites on the A354 between Dorchester and Weymouth. As vehicles pass the cameras a vehicle lookup enquiry is made to ascertain data on their CO2 emission rating, which is then used to drive Arduino controlled air turbines, generating movement in six particle filled acrylic tubes. As the total amount of CO2 emitted ebbs and flows, the air rate is increased and decreased in correlation, changing the velocity of the particles. At the same time the tubes are flooded with light corresponding to the now ubiquitous environmental ratings charts. In this way, the viewer gains insight into the immaterial flow of CO2 between Dorchester and Weymouth at any given moment in time.

The artwork was inspired by notions of hard labour and economic exploitation, which provided the conceptual underpinning for an exhibition and a public performance in Southampton from June 7 to June 12, 2014.

Statement:

Can people be reduced in an extreme process of commodification to objects? What is the process that numbering and data mining generates within a societal context? Is the extreme consequence of unchecked ideological forms of contemporary capitalism driving illogical syllogisms to their ultimate destination?

The processes of extreme contemporary commodification together with systems of data collections that are neatly boxing within pre-conceived frameworks a wide range of human activities are embedded within capitalistic ideological frameworks of exploitation of society and the masses within it. This conjunction is re-introducing within contemporary post-society Medieval concepts of abuse that marketed as 'necessary' or 'empowering' create new categories: neo-serfs, micro-thievery on global scale or legal unethical exploitations.

By reducing people to 'Cars,' literally and setting up a Car Dealership - part of a new business venture called Lanfranco Aceti Inc. - the artwork re-introduced to Britain neo-serfs labour conditions in order to sustain economic growth and create new jobs.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0EF2E6C-4D80-4C7B-80EF-33357D82996F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The performance took place between 7 - 11 June 2014 in Guildhall Square, Southampton

We can see them but they are unaware of our watching. And although transformed to an abstract landscape, behind it we would be able to recognize them. One by one.
 
What you are seeing is a landscape, taking place right now. Two realities merge into a panorama of a contemporary landscape. In the west, cars are coming right at you. In the east, you overlook the arriving and departing ships in the harbour taking their time.
 
Everywhere you hear this constant noise, is it the sea you hear or is it the sound of a highway? There is no way to distinguish other than by seeing or imagining, because both are, as the Dutch poet Henk Ester claims, in E flat.
 
&amp;quot;Fronting Motion&amp;quot; is an Internet based artwork by PolakVanBekkum

Practical description.
 &amp;quot;Fronting Motion&amp;quot; consists of two screens and two surround soundscapes (automatically converted to stereo if applicable) facing each other. The work is based on two streams of live data: one coming from number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras along the A354, Dorchester-Weymouth, while the other stream originates from the vessel tracking system around the Nearby Southampton harbour, both in the UK. Both data streams are translated into a surround sound stream and a corresponding visual stream. Each stream is broadcast through its own url, which makes the piece technically very simple to present and flexible to any given space: it could be exhibited as a black box installation for art spaces, but also on two combined screens, of various sizes (computers, smartphones, pads, outdoor projection). Thus combined, the two streams create a multiphonic soundscape with two video screens: 1 screen plus surround/stereo represents the traffic flow on land, the other screen plus surround/stereo sound represents the traffic flow at sea.

Through this period, a growing number of sharing communities have emerged and our work in the transport field is especially important as the largest gains from collaboration are likely to be achieved through sharing private vehicles as this is an underutilised resource. As a result our apps have attracted interest from public, commercial and third sector organisations, as well as individuals motivated to promote sharing in their community. This has led to additional trials (outlined above) and a Connected Communities follow-on grant awarded through the AHRC (Communities within Spaces of FlowsAH/L013258/1) which, among other things, explored how our collaborative travel apps might unlock community potential to achieve well-being gains. Dialogue is currently underway with a British Motorsports Society (beermountain.com) to trial the Linklocal app at the Le Mans event in France. However, we have been cautious about the widespread optimism that our apps have received since the research has identified a number of fundamental challenges that need to be tackled. Therefore, at the present time, the most significant economic and societal impact lies in the understanding we have brought with respect to the challenges of app enabled collaborative travel. This will enable more informed choices about adoption of collaborative travel apps and appropriate strategies to successfully initiate and maintain use.

The Travelling Treasures smart phone apps is currently being trialled by the Edinburgh Museums and Galleries and findings will be made clear toward the end of the year. Early engagement is good and the use of local bus data to boost museum tourism has been warmly received as a demonstration of Internet of Things / Smart Cities thinking. A paper on the application will be presented at the forthcoming Digital Economy All Hands event in December 2014 (Speed, C., Shingleton, D. &amp;amp; Dickinson, J. (2014) Using city bus data as a platform for smart tourism. RCUK Digital Economy All Hands conference, London 2014. ) 

CoGet remains an experimental social logistics application that is a little too 'near future' for wide spread take up. However the application informs a highly engaging experience for participants who want to better understand the potential for people and transport as information carriers. Following the successful workshop at Future Everything in March 2014, the team have submitted the technology for a follow-on workshop at Transmedialle, Berlin in January 2015.

Keyfort, an IT engineering company (www.keyfort.co.uk) are working with Oxfam to develop their FreightVista fleet management system. They will incorporate specific functionality developed from the 6STOxfam app with trials on going as of March 2016.

Our work on the 6ST prototype data hub has fed directly into a number of additional research projects including TSB funded activities in the IoT domain (Smart Streets) and intelligent highways maintenance (Smart Clean). These projects are highly visible to industry in the UK.

Understanding, through practical demonstration, the challenges facing transport practitioners, policy makers and app developers in adopting collaborative travel apps, specifically: attracting users and identifying user need; maintaining balance in the reciprocal exchange; the use of incentives; subjective time pressure generated by these systems; and the types of communities where systems are most likely to succeed. (Dickinson, J., Cherrett, T., Hibbert, J., Winstanley, C., Shingleton, D., Davies, N., Norgate, S., Speed, C. Fundamental challenges in designing a collaborative travel app (Submitted to the Journal of Transport Policy October 2014)


Demonstrating the extent to which regular vehicles can be identified in traffic streams during the morning and evening commutes using automatic number plate recognition data, and how their habitual arrival patterns can be used to identify abnormal traffic conditions (McLeod, F., Cherrett, T., Box, S., Pritchard, J., Shingleton, D., Speed, C. Investigating regularity in travel patterns using vehicle registration plate data and the scope for improved network management (In preparation for the Journal of Transport Geography)


Establishing a publicly accessible vocabulary regarding the potential for new models of transport based upon social networking principles and smartphone technology that offer potential transport options in time and space (Speed, C., Shingleton, D., Box, S., Cherrett, T., Dickinson, J., Davies, N. &amp;amp; Norgate, S. An Internet of Cars, UTSG 45th Annual Conference, University of Oxford, January 2013.


The development and testing of three experimental smartphone apps designed to help users across three separate domains (tourism, logistics and school run travel) visualise transport and collaborative opportunities around them in space and time. Elements from all the apps have been or are being taken forward by industry:

i) (Keyfort, an IT engineering company (www.keyfort.co.uk) are working with Oxfam to develop their FreightVista fleet management system. They will incorporate specific functionality developed from the 6STOxfam app. Trials are due to start in February 2015)
ii) A series of Local Authorities and third sector organisations (Dorset County Council, South Somerset Council, Yarlington Housing Association, Wester Hailes Health Agency) have all trialled derivatives of the 6STCamping app (6STTravel and LinkLocal ) across a range of rural and urban communities. 
iii) Partnerships were developed with Modeshift UK, Modeshift Northwest, Transport for Greater Manchester, district councils or authorities (e.g. Trafford, Manchester city, Salford Urban Vision, Oldham, Wigan, Stockport, Bolton, Cumbria), as well as primary schools with the 'where is my walking school bus' app. There has also been interest from school leaders in Canada, USA and Europe. 
iv) Following an interest in the concept of an Internet of Cars that capitalises on moving vehicles, Edinburgh Museums and Galleries, Lothian Buses and the University of Edinburgh developed the Travelling Treasures application for public release (iOS and Android). The app that combines museum information with bus data encourages tourists and locals to visit lesser known museums. Funded in part by a Scottish Funding Council via SICSA &amp;pound;40k.

The subsequent launch on the Apple App store and Google Play store of 3 apps using the concepts derived from the experimental apps in the trials (CoGet, Travelling Treasurers and Internet of Cars). CoGet (iOS only) is an experimental social logistics application that allows communities to move objects across dense urban contexts through the correlation of individual routines. The app was launched and demonstrated at Future Everything Festival, March 2014. Travelling Treasures (iOS and Android) is currently being trialled in Edinburgh by the Edinburgh Museum and Galleries and Lothian Buses. (see details above). The Internet of Cars application (iOS and Android) was launched to coincide with the large public engagement event of the same name across towns and cities in the south of England. The app allowed users to review events as well as submit the registration number of their own car so that others may scan it for information. 

The prototype data hub we developed has been taken forward as part of an In The WIld project on Sustainable Transport. It is currently being used to support several applications including new forms of highways maintenance scheduling systems and the Walking School Bus Application as it is rolled out nationwide.


Demonstrating how the temporal patterns of traffic flow and our travel impacts can be better visualised by the public through commissioning digital artists who worked with the projects outcomes to produce six distinct pieces, viewed by over 26,000 people between 13th May and 8th July 2014. The Internet of Cars distributed exhibition occurred over venues in Bridport, Winchester and Southampton and consisted of a wide variety of art and design works. Highly engaging, the show took findings and technologies from the research project to develop experiences and artworks that engaged the public. The show was in part funded through the 6ST research project but was 'topped up' through a Digital Economy Telling Tales of Engagement award (&amp;pound;10k) and an Arts Council of England 'Grants for the Arts' award (&amp;pound;15k).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Developing collaborative travel apps:

Our analysis identifies a number of strategies could be implemented by app developers and transport planners to help redress the reciprocal balance in collaborative travel apps (where offers of help dominate): user protocols; user champions; visualising successful exchanges and lurking behaviour; information sharing; demonstrating how help providers benefit; and making the exchange process easy. 


Using smartphones and sensors to improve logistics operations:

The research with Oxfam has shown that commercial grade smartphones can be used to aid charity organisations manage their vehicle fleets and inventory while the use of heuristics to optimise collections from smart receptacles will reduce their transport footprint. The outputs from the project are currently being further developed by a software company and Oxfam.


Encouraging sustainable school travel:

Local authorities and schools will be able to use the 'where is my walking school bus?' app to help reduce local congestion around schools and encourage more walking over the last-mile. Android and iPhone versions of the app have been developed for roll-out.


Aiding traffic management through ANPR data:

Traffic control centres and automatic number plate recognition software providers will benefit from the new understanding gained on how identifying the arrival patterns of regular vehicles in the traffic stream can help reveal abnormal traffic conditions. 

The systems research community have benefited from the new understanding generated on how predictive services can be used to support mobile applications.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>902929E7-5DEA-4560-BC58-BF9BF893D3E7</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Environment,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Transport</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.sixthsensetransport.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Across the connected city small things play a large part in sustaining the flow between people and places.

Charities, like most organisations, are constantly looking at ways of both increasing revenues and reducing costs. 
For charities with a significant high street presence, transportation and logistics is one of their major costs. Donations at shops and banks are occurring 24 x 7, all needing to be collected, sorted and distributed. Lacking the resources of major commercial retailers, and with a significant dependence on volunteers, charities have a unique set of issues around managing the logistics of donation collection and distribution. 

In conjunction with the University of Southampton, Keyfort has developed a cloud based application, FreightVista for Charities, which manages the complete lifecycle from donation through to central collection. It contains three elements:

1) Shop View

A single and easy web page with large and self-explanatory boxes to input the daily donations (clothes sacks, shoe sacks, book sacks etc.). Urgent requests for collection are a click away. 

 2) Transport Manager View

A comprehensive set of functions that allow the scheduling of collections by the vehicle fleets, highly visual views using Google maps to view all the shops, banks and track the drivers in real-time. 

3) Driver App

A smartphone application that enables each driver to hold their daily collection schedule and record collections as they occur. GPS allows the transport managers to see where the drivers are and to re-schedule or re-route if required.</gtr:description><gtr:id>620D35B4-C786-4D53-A946-5E1FD2E85589</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It is now used in over 75 shops by Oxfam</gtr:impact><gtr:openSourceLicense>true</gtr:openSourceLicense><gtr:title>FreightVista</gtr:title><gtr:type>Software</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://keyfort.co.uk/solutions/software/freightvista</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2015</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>LinkLocal is an iPhone app that borrows much of the functionality of 6ST Travel and allows people to share resources.

The app is available on iOs and Android

Walking School Buses (WSBs) involve children walking together to school as a group supervised by a coordinator. 

App Features:
- goWSB is an innovative application that exploits real-time information to enable families to track the WSB as it travels along designated stops and reaches the school. 
- You can get a real-time estimate of the WSBs' arrival time at your chosen stop and a visualisation of when it arrives at the school.
- Download the routes provided by your school and choose the route your child will take.
- You can securely add your child to the WSB's register so that the coordinator knows which stop to pick them up at.
- Coordinators can use the application to track their position on the way to school. This runs in the background so they can forget about the phone, put it in their pocket and concentrate on looking after your children.
- You can receive a 2 minute alert when the WSB is about to reach your stop.
- Works anywhere you have a GPS and data connection.

Use goWSB to:
- Better coordinate your morning routine with real-time knowledge of where the WSB is.
- Get ready for a certain time with real-time predictions of when the WSB will get to your stop.
- Let the coordinator know whether your child is getting on the WSB that day.
- Check that your child safely got to school.</gtr:description><gtr:id>39357CB3-5165-4A06-B0BE-38644B7D9E03</gtr:id><gtr:impact>goWSB is holding a National Walking School Bus Competition to coincide with national walk to school week in May 2016.
