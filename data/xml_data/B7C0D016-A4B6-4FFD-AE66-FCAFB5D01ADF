This project aims to achieve a better understanding of the need and constraints involved in regulating food marketing to children as part of effective obesity prevention policies worldwide, and in the UK more specifically.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Project has three related strands. The Grant Holder will first spend five months at the World Health Organisation in Geneva to help selected states from across the world identify potential barriers to the development and implementation of policies on food marketing to children and find potential solutions. The second part of the Project consists in the organisation of a one-day conference in London which will focus on what the UK should do to fully comply with the WHO Recommendations on food marketing to children.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Project will conclude with the publication of a monograph intended, first, to capture existing knowledge on food marketing to children and, secondly, to replace practical concerns within a broader theoretical framework to bridge the gap existing in this area between academia and practice.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Firstly, the project will assist WHO and policy makers in developing the legal skills required to design food marketing policies. It will therefore contribute to the adoption of more effective childhood obesity prevention strategies at national, regional and international level. The project will be of particular benefit to the selected Member States working with the Investigator for the duration of the project, particularly during her six-month placement at WHO. It has been agreed that these States would include the UK in light of the her expertise and her knowledge of English law, as well as a selection of low and middle income countries which may not have the capacity to invest in policies restricting food marketing to children as much as growing obesity trends would require and are therefore in particular need for the development of creative solutions. The project nonetheless has the potential to reach all 193 Member States parties to the Recommendations through the sharing of the investigator's expertise with, and the training of, WHO staff members. 

Secondly, the project will benefit consumer and public health organisations as key stakeholders involved in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of obesity prevention strategies. The project will inform their advocacy campaigns for stronger restrictions on the marketing of food to children and therefore assist them in developing the tools required to promote public health objectives at national, regional and international level. In particular, it will help them counteract more effectively the misconceived argument regularly advanced by food and advertising industry operators - and often relayed by policy makers - that the constitutionally protected right to free commercial speech prevents the imposition of any restrictions on food marketing to children. 

Similarly, the project should benefit child-focused NGOs and children's rights advocacy groups, with a stronger basis to propose alternative strategies in the future. Adopting a children's rights approach to the issue of unhealthy food marketing offers much potential for law and policy reform, even though the development of obesity prevention strategies has tended to be rather low (if at all) on the agenda of children's rights NGOs/campaigners. This project aims to promote the best interest of the child in all policy areas, as mandated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Indirectly, therefore, it should benefit children and their families, and therefore improve their welfare, particularly but not exclusively in the UK.

By developing a more thorough understanding of the arguments underpinning the debate about the regulation of food marketing to children, the project also has the potential to help food and advertising industry operators re-assess their position and more willingly embrace the need for significant changes in the discourse and the approaches they have adopted to date.

Finally, the Investigator's ability to frame the debate in more conceptual terms may also indirectly influence the thinking of policy makers and other stakeholders involved in the development of restrictions on the marketing of other products, including alcoholic beverages, tobacco products and pharmaceuticals, as part of effective public health strategies.

The project therefore has a very broad range of potential research user beneficiaries, both direct and indirect. This is due to at least three factors. Firstly, growing childhood obesity rates are a cause for concern in all countries in the world, thus making obesity a public health priority at national, regional and global levels. Secondly, obesity is a multifactorial condition which requires the concerted action of a broad range of stakeholders in a range of policy areas, including food marketing regulation. Finally, food marketing is a global issue affecting all countries in the world, thus making it an inherently international issue (see below).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2013-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>98745</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>UNICEF</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chidren's Rights and Food Marketing</gtr:description><gtr:id>3E130A76-0151-4F17-B6B2-9A8EBE79A190</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The work is ongoing.

One of the targets it lays down is a halt in the rise of diabetes and obesity by 2025. To achieve this target, the Action Plan calls on Member States to implement the WHO Recommendations on the marketing of food and non-alcoholic
beverages to children.


The Economic and Social Research Council, the Centre of European Law at King's College London and the School of Law and Social Justice at the University of Liverpool have joined forces to support a one-day conference to discuss how the WHO Recommendations can help improve the regulatory framework in Member States, focusing on the UK more specifically. In particular, it provides an opportunity to reflect on the regulation of food marketing to children two years after the Government published its 'Call to action on obesity in England'. The event is organised in collaboration with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the International Association for the Study of Obesity.

This event will gather a wide range of stakeholders, from Government representatives to academics of different disciplines and representatives of civil society. Three particularly controversial issues will be at the heart of the conference discussions: the need to ensure a sufficiently broad scope of protection; the need to avoid conflicts of interest; and the need to regulate cross-border marketing.

The event is free and by invitation only. If you would like to attend, please contact Professor Amandine Garde at amandine.garde@liverpool.ac.uk.

This conference is part of a one-year research project funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (Grant Number: ES/J020761/1).

Following this workshop and my placement at WHO Head Office in Geneva, the World Health Organization have asked me to organise some workshop on the role legal instruments can play in promoting healthier lifestyles, and more specifically on the 

A Special Issue gathering the papers presented at the Workshop is forthcoming in the European Journal of Risk Regulation. It takes a multidisciplinary approach and is purposefully intended to include the views of academic researchers to those of policy-makers on the ground.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://liv.ac.uk/law/research/european-childrens-rights-unit/events/fmr/index.htm</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of a Group of International Experts on alcohol marketing to children</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>63A7B369-3D38-4893-8EC9-89CFABEF4946</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Alcohol Focus Scotland convened an international working group to work on how best Scotland, within the scope of its devolved powers, could regulate alcohol marketing to protect children from its harmful impact.
