Controlling alcoholic affordability and availability are amongst the most effective policy options available to governments. These policies can be unpopular with consumers and industry, so it is important that decisions are based on sound evidence about the expected costs and benefits. If policies come into force, it is important that we test if expected effects really occur. Our aim is to lead a step-change in capability to predicting and testing the effects of policies. With policy stakeholders and international advisors, we identified priority work areas where work is most urgently needed and bring together alcohol policy researchers, and experts in combining evidence, policy appraisal, industrial economics, health economics and public health information to undertake the research. We plan to
1. Collect and analyse data and perform evidence reviews in areas where new evidence is critical to inform policy effectiveness research: (a) how the alcohol market responds to policies; (b) how changes in binge drinking relate to changes in illness and crime; (c) how people?s drinking varies over time; (d) how long it takes for policy changes to have an effect on drinking and harm; and (e) what role the socio-political situation (eg. current recession) plays in influencing whether a policy works. 
2. Building a computer-based tool that can predict the likely effects of current and possible future options for alcohol taxation and retail licensing (key policy areas discussed in the UK) ? e.g. the health and social impact of higher taxes for extra strength alcohol or returning closing time to 11pm. 
3. Methodological work so that this tool can place the policy in the real-world context of recent and long-term changes to alcohol prices, income, drinking and harm. 
4. Using the evolving tool to analyse real policy options as the work develops: many methodological advances in recent alcohol policy appraisal have come about because ?an answer was needed now?. We will write annual reports and will work closely with policy makers and, where appropriate, the media, to ensure that our research is able to inform policy debates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim for this research programme is to lead a step-change in capabilities for robust scientific appraisal of new and existing alcohol policy interventions. Controlling alcoholic affordability and availability are amongst the most effective policy options available to governments. These policies can be unpopular with consumers and industry, so it is imperative that decisions are based on sound evidence. However, important knowledge gaps remain and with policy stakeholders and international advisors, we identified priority areas for scientific advance. 
1. New evidence to inform policy appraisal: We propose data acquisition, data analysis and evidence synthesis in areas where new evidence is critical: (a) Market response to pricing policy; (b) Relationship between heavy episodic drinking and harms in different settings; (c) Variability in individuals? consumption patterns over time; (d) Time lag between policy, consumption and harm changes; and (e) Socio-political context effects that may moderate policy effectiveness. 
2. Building of a model that considers taxation and availability policy options: Taxes are the only price-based interventions currently operating in most Western economies. The health and social impact of a range of taxation options (eg. the current ?duty escalator?; differential taxation by alcoholic strength) will be appraised. Similarly, we will appraise availability policies, which remain almost unexamined due to lack of integrated data on outlet opening hours and density. 
3. Building a dynamic model: Current models are static, assuming a ?stay steady? baseline level of consumption and harms, rather than dynamic i.e. accounting for trends over time. We propose a major model revision to account for recent and long-term underlying trends in alcohol prices, income, consumption and harm.
4. Policy evaluation/model validation: Many methodological advances in our recent modelling have come about because ?an answer was needed? to real policy options. We propose to incorporate a 3 year programme of policy appraisal that is responsive to emerging stakeholder needs. We will produce annual reports on evidence synthesis, model developments, validations and policy appraisals, to enable researchers and UK and international policy stakeholders to view and use developing work. 
A systematic comparison of model predictions with real changes in consumption/harm will also be undertaken. We bring together UK and international alcohol policy researchers, and experts in evidence synthesis, policy modelling, industrial economics, health economics and public health information and expect that our work programme will lead to major advances in evidence-based alcohol policy decision making. Strong links with stakeholders have been established to facilitate exploitation.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-14</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-11-15</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1089377</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>NIHR Choice Architecture</gtr:description><gtr:id>560FFEAC-58A5-49D9-80BE-3CAF8C1155F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An unsuccessful &amp;pound;469k NIHR Public Health Research Programme grant application for research trialling a choice architecture intervention.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Cambridge and Nottingham will provide advisory support throughout the project.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Our research group are overall leads on the proposed research and will run the trial intervention, the qualitative component and the health economics analysis.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Dresden University of Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>My Coacher</gtr:description><gtr:id>03A61742-ACA3-4F0F-837D-78E839A0FE5E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>An unsuccessful bid for ?5.2m was submitted to the EU under their Horizon 2020 programme.

The Sheffield researcher presented results relating to minimum pricing from the Scottish adaptation of the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model and took questions on broader issues of alcohol pricing policy.

The Irish Health Minister specifically requested the Sheffield researcher's slides be forwarded to him as he was currently working on the Republic of Ireland's alcohol strategy.

The Republic of Ireland has announced that minimum pricing will be the centrepiece of its alcohol and public health legislation. 

The Governments of Ireland and Northern Ireland jointly commissioned an adaptation of the Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model to provide policy appraisals of minimum pricing specific to their countries.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/parliamentarians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2012</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Methodological engagement with OECD</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2EBD57F2-A103-413B-B5E3-4109995381B3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A dialogue was entered into with researchers at the OECD regarding methodological approaches to assessing the cost-effectiveness of screening and brief interventions programmes for alcohol.

This judgement was subsequently over-turned and referred to the European Court of Justice where a ruling in December 2015 stated, informed by our evidence on the potential effectiveness of the policy, that MUP would be legal if it achieved greater benefits to public health than alternative options and fewer impacts on free trade than existing policy options - particularly increasing alcohol taxes.

Using a novel household panel dataset where some households remained panel members for several years, we were able to analyse how estimates of alcohol price elasticities varied when we restricted the data to different lengths of observation period. 

As data available for estimating alcohol price elasticities often has many limitations and short observation periods, this analysis substantially increases our understanding of the degree of bias embedded within elasticities estimated from different data sources.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CF8E419B-2B47-49C0-8227-5555382BC4EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A paper is awaiting revisions following peer review with a leading academic journal.
