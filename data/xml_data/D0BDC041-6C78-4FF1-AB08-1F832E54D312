Who will benefit from this research?
In addition to the academic community, findings of this research are of interest to a number of potential non-academic beneficiaries. These include: National policy-makers responsible for technology and industrial policy and development in LICs; International organisations concerned with industrial development, eg., DFID, UNCTAD, UNIDO, World Bank, UNDESA, ADB; NGOs and development-orientated research institutions; Business managers in LICs.
II. How will they benefit from this research? 
The project will make its best efforts to address academic, policy, economic and societal impacts through activities involving Communications and Engagement, Collaboration, Exploitation and Application. 
1. Communications, Engagement and Collaboration
-The project has developed partnerships with the Science and Technology Policy Research Institute (STEPRI) of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Ghana; the African Globelics Doctoral Academy, and leading scholars at the Universities of Cape Town and Tshwane; and has obtained support from policy makers such as the Ministry of Science and Technology of Ghana and UNCTAD. The proposal was co-developed through several rounds of consultation with relevant stakeholders.
-We plan to hold a seminar at an early stage of the project to have another 'reality check'.
-Findings from the research will have important policy and practical implications for LICs. The policy reports and best practice guidebooks will be useful to practitioners and educators. The network analysis is a participatory co-production process. The collaboration with scholars and research institutes in LICs will also significantly enhance our local policy and business linkages.
Exploitation and application
-The dissemination mechanisms include policy meetings and workshops with developing country policy makers &amp;amp; managers, and policy workshops at relevant UN meetings and networks. The PI and the researchers will feed the findings into the policy making process of the stakeholders. The project will organise two Conferences in Oxford and Africa. 
-It will also organise a joint workshop with African Globelics Doctoral Academy, disseminating the findings and contribute to capacity building in the younger African generation.
-ODID/QEH and the PI have extensive experience of cooperation with the UNCTAD, UNIDO and various international development initiatives and NGOs, for instance, the Improving Institutions for Growth (IIG) program, the IGC and Oxfam. The PI has already had preliminary discussions with the Director of IIG who expressed strong interest in holding joint outreach workshops in Ethiopia because of real demand in Africa to increase innovation and productivity. The linkage with UNCTAD will strengthen the policy impact and research uptake of the project. 
-The project-created survey database and research findings will contribute to an ESRC project online database and DFID Research portal. This new survey database will enable more high quality research on other important issues highlighted in the DFID/ESRC Call, eg, finance and innovation, skills for productivity growth. 
-The project will engage graduate students at ODID, eg., the MSc Economics for Development and MPhil Development Studies student will use this database for their thesis research. Small travel funds will be provided to MPhil students who work on topics closely related to the project research.
-The project will also engage more researchers in the Cambridge-Oxford Engineering for Development initiative, and explore out-of-box solutions for the poorer societies.
-A project-based web-site will be developed after the launch of the project. We will publish the practical guidebooks introducing best practices.
-Public media channels will also be used to disseminate the findings of the research. The PI is already an active discussant on major media such as the BBC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-02-29</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>480712</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Science and Technology Policy Research Institute (CSIR-STEPRI)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Ghana, Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Collaboration with Science and Technology Policy Research Institute (CSIR-STEPRI) - Accra (Ghana)</gtr:description><gtr:id>C399E14E-459A-4B40-A52C-CF21EF837FA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>DILIC Workshop in Ghana, DILIC Results Dissemination Conference, DILIC Training Course</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>CSIR-STEPRI supports fieldwork and liaise with local ministers and policy makers</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Support capacity building of CSIR-STEPRI</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UK Foreign Aid Turns to Research, Nature, April 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>92F81E61-A095-4307-BA27-734225018F97</gtr:id><gtr:impact>'UK Foreign Aid Turns to Research', Nature, April 2014

We disseminated the results to various academic conferences and to policy makers. We involved local policy makers in Ghana (Ministry of Science, Environment, and Innovation) and international organizations (UNIDO and UNCTAD).

The Ghanaian government initiated a USD500,000 program to strengthen university-industry linkage for innovation. The program is led by our local partner. 
Moreover, the Ghanaian government launched a new large scale survey of innovation in 2000 firms in the country. It was carried out by our local partner based on the DILIC survey tool and the capability built up in the process of the project.

The PI, Prof Xiaolan Fu, was appointed by the Secretary General of the UN to the high level 10-Member Group to the Technology Facilitation Mechanism. 
The PI was also appointed by the SG of the UN to the Governing Council of the Technology Bank for the Least Developing Countries. She is also invited to the Leadership Council of the UN SDSN. Findings from DILIC has fed into UN policy debate and plan through these channels, for example, the role of regional value chain, the need to strengthen university-industry linkage, and policies for international technology transfer.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C007122A-54A4-4CB9-A708-A615EF1F24B4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Findings

The project yielded a number of findings relating to the nature, impact, and sources (both national and international) of innovation in LICs.
 
The nature of innovation
?Innovation takes place everywhere; in developed countries and in LICs, in formal and informal sectors. During 2011-2013, 80% of firms surveyed in Ghana had introduced some form of innovation. 
?But, not all innovation is measured using conventional indicators such as patents and research and development. It is often &amp;quot;under the radar&amp;quot;. (Zanello et al., 2013).

The impact of innovation
?In LICs, innovation often takes the form of transfer, adoption and adaptation of existing technology, rather than new invention. This is one reason why patent activity and research and development (R&amp;amp;D) measures are often low in LICs. R&amp;amp;D expenditure to GDP ratios also vary considerably among country groups, from close to zero expenditure in LICs and 0.61 in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) to 0.96 in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) and 2.32 in higher-income countries (HICs) in 2011. The share of R&amp;amp;D spending from foreign sources is larger at lower per capita income levels. 
?Diffusion and learning-based innovation has enabled firms in LICs to survive and grow. The DILIC survey of 500 firms in Ghana suggests that innovation raises labour productivity of firms through learning (Fu et al., 2014). However the low level of investment in technology-intensive innovations results in a slow process of structural change and industry upgrading.

The sources of innovation in LICs are often external
?Innovative export upgrading (increased product sophistication) in LICs depends on capital deepening, engagement in knowledge creation, knowledge transfer via investment in education and R&amp;amp;D, and foreign direct investment and imports. Cross-country analysis for 171 countries over 1992-2006 shows that the effect of a country's domestic R&amp;amp;D on export sophistication is insignificant for low and low-middle income countries, while the effects of imports, foreign direct investment and education are positive and significant (Zhu &amp;amp; Fu, 2013). 
?Analysis of region-specific firm and industry data for Ghana in suggests that import of Chinese products has a significant positive impact on total factor productivity at the firm level, which in turn suggests that Ghana is learning useful lessons from its interaction with China (Fu et al., 2015). 

Innovation depends on participation in value chains and the formation of national/regional (if not global) production networks
?Forming national or cross-African vertical production networks allows firms to produce more sophisticated products, whereas single firms typically don't have the capacity to do so (Fu et al., 2014).

Support systems are often inadequate or unknown to investors
?The survey in Ghana suggests that whilst firms are often innovative, and the Ghanaian government well-regarded as an innovation partner, most firms do not benefit from extension services such as loans or training. On the one hand, firms have little knowledge of the policy instruments available to them. On the other, innovation is not always recognised and/or measured by government, who therefore do not sufficiently support innovation efforts within the firms (Fu et al., 2014).</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The DILIC survey of the diffusion of innovation in Ghana was the first survey in LICs dedicated to the origin and diffusion of innovation within and to these countries. Such instrument should be used in other LICs to capture the heterogeneity of these countries and how innovation is materialize. Moreover a survey in two-three year time of the same Ghanaian firms covered in the DILIC survey would critically provide a more solid understanding of the innovation dynamics over time.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>0C4A4A33-36C2-4198-8520-7C22510AAE52</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Construction,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://degrp.squarespace.com/reflections/2016/2/12/diffusion-of-innovation-in-low-income-countries</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Appointment to the UN Technology Facilitation high level advisory group</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D2C7067C-6ACE-48E1-8FD3-A8DAABD1353E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The DILIC project has had a major impact on policies for innovation and development in low-income countries at global and national levels.
