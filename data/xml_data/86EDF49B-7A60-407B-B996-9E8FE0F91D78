defines geoengineering as ?deliberate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment to counteract anthropogenic climate change?.This project addresses the governance challenges from various geoengineering options.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research will cover five world regions, and actively engage stakeholders. It will employ questionnaires, interviews, literature and web reviews, and scenario workshops. Its themes are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>Framings of Geoengineering. How is geoengineering framed in social, technical and legal terms? What can we learn from other emerging technologies, or from attempts to manage the financial system? What conceptions of justice and fairness and what current laws and treaties might apply?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Dilemmas of Control of Geoengineering Technologies. What are the particular challenges - in assessing benefits and risks, in public acceptability, in the risks of lock-in and path dependency, in avoiding over-optimistic costings, in dealing with uncertainty, and in international relations - and what solutions are there?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>Choosing Governance and Regulatory Requirements. How would governance and regulatory arrangements work? Can they be made sensitive and adaptive? What new rulemaking and procedural harmonisation would be required, and could the buy-in of various interests be secured? Finally, what wider lessons can we learn for technology assessment and governance, and what further research is needed? &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Much current policy discourse on climate change points to the need to assess the potential contribution of geoengineering approaches alongside mitigation and adaptation. The IPCC has called an expert meeting on geoengineering in June which will involve all three of its working groups, and the field is likely to continue to increase in strategic importance. This project will help the UK to consolidate the leading position it has established through the Royal Society report (Royal Society, 2009) and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee's Report on the Regulation of Geoengineering (House of Commons, 2010), to which the authors of this proposal have made significant contributions.

Both reports called for the detailed consideration of the governance issues associated with geoengineering. The Government's response to the House of Commons report concurred that research to develop regulatory frameworks was required (UK Government, 2010). This project addresses in full the policy requirements that the Select Committee identified and the Government endorsed. The research team involves all three members of the Royal Society Working Group who worked on the governance aspects of that report, and all five of the authors of the Oxford Principles that were endorsed by the Select Committee and adapted by the Asilomar International Conference (2010) on geoengineering. The project has been designed to produce results which have high policy salience and impact in a range of ways:

- its agenda develops the Oxford Principles and covers the key policy issues discussed in the debate to date: the efficacy, safety, affordability and acceptability of both experimentation and deployment of each of the proposed geoengineering approaches;
- it establishes baseline knowledge as to how existing laws, treaties and regulatory arrangements bear on the issues, and where the gaps lie;
- it deepens policy choice by exploring the social, economic and ethical positions which underlie governance objectives and examining issues of distributive and intergenerational justice which arise;
- it draws on other ongoing work in geoengineering assessment, notably IAGP (2010) and the SRGI (2010) and from regulatory developments in other policy domains, notably financial services, and contributes to the understanding of the governance of other new technologies; 
- it recognises that many geoengineering approaches cross boundaries and require understanding of interactions between local, national and global governance, and analyses capacities and policy perspectives on geoengineering in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas;
- its final stage involves the research team working with practitioners to define policy and regulatory choices. This builds on a set of workshops engaging with governments, commercial and non-commercial proponents of geoengineering, and civil society organisations, initiated by the Oxford Geoengineering Programme with independent sources of funding; 
- its five reports - part of a wider set of outputs - will be targeted at those setting and scrutinising policy. These cover: 
o Month 8. Use of the reverse stress test in characterising geoengineering proposals. 
o Month 9. Geoengineering: Justice, risks and benefits. 
o Month 12. Current law and regulation on geoengineering: A comparative study 
o Month 22. Potential pathways for geoengineering development 
o Month 26. Climate geoengineering governance 

The main policy output of this project will be a set of approaches to enable policymakers to craft a geoengineering governance framework. The research will also (a) inform the construction of governance frameworks for future novel technologies as these emerge, and (b) provide insights as to how &amp;quot;appraisal optimism&amp;quot; in costing new technology - a term coined by H. M. Treasury - might be countered. The research teams will additionally use their own networks to strengthen policy engagement around the main findings.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-12-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>1047846</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Keynote Address - Climate Geoengineering: Dr Strangelove or Dr Salk</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1D87E575-87F5-4946-8A64-73D25D059310</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Steve Rayner gave this keynote to ADC (Australian Davos Connection) Future Summit, Melbourne, Australia

This represents both an opportunity - to draw on resources additional to those which the public sector can provide and the establishment of norms that are not commercially driven - and also a threat - funding from philanthropic sources is not constrained by rigorous governance considerations.

Its broad aim was not only to get feedback on the three work packages which comprise our first phase of work and some specific research issues we will be tackling in the coming months, but also to get a sense of what the agenda of issues on climate geoengineering governance might be 18 months downstream when the CGG is producing its final outputs.



The workshop comprised two sessions situating geoengineering governance - mitigation, adaptation and geoengineering as governance issues, and geoengineering as an emerging technology; three sessions on work done under CGG's first three work packages - geoengineering as a 'novel' sociotechnical construction, issues of ethics and procedural justice, and issues of law and regulation; and followed by a session on some future works - looking at engagement's two roles in CGG, as an object of study, and a means of stimulating informed debate. The workshop concluded with two sessions on what we may have learned so far - from other geoengineering projects which raised governance issues, and from Germany the US and Sweden.



There were 44 workshop participants, 17 from the CGG research team or associates, 12 from UK academic or policy institutions, and 15 from other European countries or North America.



The names of speakers and organisers from the research team and associates only are listed below.

The workshop met its objectives in getting CGG known to the academic community (the primary objective although it included representatives of civil society organisations) and helping to situate our efforts in relation to other work. Many of the links made at the workshop were developed by individual members of the research team in getting comments on papers, for example.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), in its October 2015 Update on Climate Geoengineering in Relation to the CBD: Potential Impacts and Regulatory Framework, cites 13 CGG papers in the main report (about 10% of all citations on governance and regulation) and 16 more in its additional bibliography of recent work. 
In late 2015 discussions are under way with the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) to identify policy issues to be brought to the attention of the UK Parliament. In October 2013 Steve Rayner and Tim Kruger contributed to POST Note 447 Negative Emissions Technologies.
In mid 2015 Peter Healey and Steve Rayner authored Living With Environmental Change's (LWEC) Policy and Practice Note 18 on Geoengineering and its governance, and the team prepared a full set of seven briefing notes summarising the results and recommendations of CGG for policy audiences. It is still early to assess the full impact of these, although we know they are being circulated through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's S&amp;amp;T Network.
In September 2013, Steve Rayner and Tim Kruger presented to the Directors of Counter-Proliferation of each of the G8+1 countries at a meeting in London to discuss novel proliferation threats. As a follow up to this meeting, Catherine Redgwell and Tim Kruger met officials at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in January 2014 to discuss international regulatory arrangements as they relate to geoengineering. 
In October 2012, Catherine Redgwell and Chiara Armeni participated in the meeting in London of Contracting Parties to the 1972 London Dumping Convention and to the 1996 London Dumping Protocol. Following discussion of Ocean Iron Fertilization, they presented &amp;quot;Geoengineering: The Wider International Legal Context&amp;quot; which discussed key international governance challenges and potential governance models beyond the marine context. 
The Oxford Principles were further developed during the project and widely cited in international policy and academic discourse on geoengineering governance.
In a personal communication, Phil Williamson (UEA and NERC) writes:
'I would be surprised if there are many other programmes that have had such a range and depth of policy influences.'

CGG International Impact

CGG International Workshops were held in Beijing, New Delhi and Singapore. Prior to our May 2014 workshop in Beijing geoengineering had not been a consistent part of Chinese policy discourse. Subsequently our Beijing hosts, Pan JiaHua and colleagues in the Institute for Urban and Environment Studies, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, have been charged with pursuing governance and social issues within a new Chinese research programme on geoengineering, launched in late 2014.
DECC, DEFRA and Research Councils participated in CGG's Scenarios Workshop, held in London in October 2014, which also included international academic and policy representation.

CGG's Impact on Research
 
CGG took the initiative in proposing closer collaboration to the other two concurrently RCUK funded geoengineering projects, IAGP and SPICE. The results included a workshop in Warwick in October 2014 between the three research teams, to deepen understanding of each other's work, and joint public presentation of key findings at the Royal Society in November 2014. Media coverage, organised with the help of the Science Media Centre, was extensive. 
In a personal communication, the PI of the SPICE project, Matt Watson, writes in December 2015:
'Governance is a critical part of the discourse around geoengineering, particularly those technologies whose deployment would see transboundary effects. SPICE was a project designed by scientists and engineers with little consideration for, or expertise in, governance. As such, the members of the SPICE project were ill equipped to consider widely the broader implications of their research. Academics from the University of Oxford's Oxford Martin School and the University of Sussex's Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) provided critical guidance to SPICE during a period of intense scrutiny and pressure.' 
As planned, the project has also worked with the Oxford Geoengineering Programme (OGP) to further develop project impacts. In February 2014 on Necker Island, Tim Kruger presented to a group of philanthropists convened by Richard Branson. Since that meeting discussions have continued with the Rasmussen Foundation, and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), amongst others. The OGP organised a Foundations' Round Table in December 2014 for CIFF, to help the charitable sector develop a research funding strategy in the area, and has since submitted a memorandum on future research based on that meeting. 
CGG's conceptual framework contributed both to the problem framing of an OGP conference on Greenhouse Gas Removal Technologies, in October 2015 (which pulled in additional support from LWEC and Virgin Earth Challenge) and to the planning (during 2014 and 2015) of a new NERC-led initiative on greenhouse gas removal, expected to be announced in early 2016.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DACE35DC-C891-4FA8-8601-3DC9FB02C0EB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Governance challenges
Climate geoengineering presents distinctive governance challenges because it:
? includes a wide range of possible technologies embodying highly heterogeneous technical practices; 
? they are novel propositions whose impacts are hard to assess;
? even experimental work on many of them (but not all) is controversial and likely to involve activities and consequences that cross jurisdictions; and 
? deployment of any of them would have to be considered in relation to further efforts in mitigation and adaptation, and in relation to problems (e.g. food shortages, lack of disaster resilience, migration) in which anthropogenic climate change is only one contributory cause.

Framing
Definitional politics are constantly at work framing and re-framing what, at any given moment, might be included under the geoengineering banner. For geoengineering governance it is important to specify the particular technological practice under consideration. 

Costs
CGG analyses of costs and economics conclude that all of the cost estimates of geoengineering are entirely overdetermined by their input assumptions. Furthermore the cost estimates only look at the project costs, ignoring the social and environmental externalities.

Security implications
The principal military applications for weather and climate control appear to be terrain denial and demoralisation of civilians, but there are cheaper and more controllable options already available. Weaponisation of geoengineering technologies as such seems unlikely. The problem of perceived cross-border impacts would inevitably arise from geoengineering experiments when attribution for climatic events is unclear. It is also likely that the implementation of technologies like sulphate aerosol injection would be carried out in conjunction with military contractors. 

Governance
International regulatory machinery could take three (not mutually exclusive) forms: adapting existing provisions; bespoke coverage of gaps in those provisions; and developing general principles of governance. In developing any regulatory framework, it is necessary to be aware of regulatory intention: is the law seeking to keep options open, or to limit potential risks? Any regulatory machinery requires flexibility to cope with changes in the technologies themselves or with the capacities to monitor and attribute their impacts.
CGG has developed indicators to assess the applicability/adaptability of existing legal instruments to geoengineering. Our assessment shows there is no one existing authority with the scope and competence to cover the whole range of international governance requirements. There is scope to adapt existing regulatory machinery such as with the London Convention/London Protocol governing dumping at sea. The regulation of what is done within the atmosphere constitutes a real gap requiring new provisions. This might be considered a priority given the attention currently being given to Solar Radiation Management technologies. 

Wider implications
We can also ask more generally what geoengineering can do for society? At the moment discussion of values is right up front before the technology is developed. So geoengineering provides opportunities to explore things like the way we think about nature, what we think is the good society, what's the role of technology in our lives, and its implications for social justice? Thinking about geoengineering can teach us about the governance of other emerging global technologies.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have already established a number of mutually beneficial research and policy links in the course of the research, which include the G8+1, academic and policy bodies in China, India and Singapore and elsewhere, the London Convention/London Protocol on Dumping at Sea, the World Economic Forum, the FCO, DECC, RCUK and other UK government bodies, and a range of civil society organisations. All of these will be made aware of our findings.

The joint programme of activity with the RCUK's IAGP and SPICE projects allowed us to develop a broadly common perspective on future research, and to start a wider discussion on the significance and future of our work. Our joint Royal Society event is publicly available through YouTube.

The immediate steps we are taking to further publicise our findings and encourage debate on their implications include the issue of a set of briefing documents in common format with those of IAGP, and discussions with Living with Environmental Change (LWEC) on a possible Policy and Practice Note on Geoengineering.

A forthcoming joint publication of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies (Potsdam) and the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society (Oxford) outlines a proposal for the establishment of professional research norms for geoengineering building on the Oxford Principles.
