Whereas most research on neuromarketing assesses neuromarketing's technical feasibility in relation to other marketing research or discusses ethical issues involved in neuromarketing research, our research focuses on how knowledge about consumers is produced and the implications of this. In particular our research highlights how neuromarketing and its procedures of knowledge production respecify a) what counts as consumer experience, b) where that consumer experience is located and c) how to capture consumer experience. We find that consumer subject(s) participating in neuromarketing experiments are secondarised (and yet their opinions are sought at various stages of the experiment) and another entity takes centre stage. This entity, the brain, is posited as a new entity central to neuromarketing; it is enacted as a proxy for understanding consumer behaviour; and it simultaneously renders other marketing techniques (surveys, focus groups etc) as unreliable. In this way, the proponents of neuromarketing technologies assume the role of experts in revealing why consumers buy what they buy. In other words, accountability for subjects' preferences passes from the subjects to the technology and its operatives.
 
Based on our research informed by the multidisciplinary field of Science and Technology Studies (STS), we examined how the respecification of consumers as non-knowledgeable and the brain as the ultimate source of knowledge about consumers' preferences is achieved through experimental practice. We argue that brains are enacted as preferable to mere consumers (in virtue of the claim that the latter are 'unreliable', 'lacking knowledge') and that brains are enacted through use of specific technologies and expertise (not available to consumers nor to 'ordinary' marketing). A corollary of this is that human agency thereby passes from the 'person' to the 'brain.
 
Our research is of potential interest to a) to consumer protection agencies in the United Kingdom (eg Which?) and beyond (eg NCC) and b) commercial marketing companies and trade associations considering the adoption and development of neuromarketing technologies (eg NMBA, World Brand Lab, China). Most importantly, our research can inform national and European consumer protection agencies' position on how adequately to protect consumers' interests in relation to neuromarketing research practices. Strategic measures to be considered could include regulatory efforts such as the adaptation of informed consent rules or stipulating rules that neuromarketing research results always need be counterbalanced by qualitative consumer research. In addition, our research can inform consumer protection agencies' contribution to ongoing debates about the effects of these new forms of marketing on consumers and on consumer accountability.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2012</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>0586BF1F-AFE1-4144-B84C-23799AD09E36</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This project adopts perspectives and sensibilities from the tradition of Science and Technologies Studies (STS) to provide insights into the contextual basis of the production, interpretation and use of (neuro )scientific knowledge and technologies in neuromarketing. This theoretical and methodological basis establishes the necessary distance to critically engage with the &amp;quot;neuroscientific turn&amp;quot; in neuromarketing, while maintaining close contact with neuromarketers to record their practices empirically through ethnographic field work.
Although we have encountered a diverse range of neuromarketing practices in different settings in our research, members of the labs we visited, observed or interviewed share an understanding of consumers as not having access to their true motives. As we have argued elsewhere, this description allows marketers to bypass consumers' accounts and to reveal the hidden causes of consumer behaviour using neuromarketing (Schneider and Woolgar, 2012: 181). Consumers are, thus, secondarised as an object of research and neuromarketing technology and experts become accountable for revealing why consumers buy what they buy. 
Our research provides a unique perspective on the way the autonomy of the individual is re-examined and modified in neuromarketing practice.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>These findings are of direct relevance to our immediate project partners in the ORA research grant and make a contribution to current debates as to what extent we are witnessing a neuro-turn in the European Social Sciences and Humanities.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6E512240-82D0-49FF-89A8-A206C8A32B72</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Member of Council of Which? - the Consumers' Association (till 2013)</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7E7DEB3A-A7D7-4915-A8ED-29A8EA85B4EF</gtr:id><gtr:type>Membership of a guideline committee</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Invitation to become Special Adviser to UK Parliamentary Select Committee on the Digital Economy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A97F8381-CFAF-4BE7-B3CC-D343251831E3</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D886566B-96FC-4680-9642-100D527280B5"><gtr:id>D886566B-96FC-4680-9642-100D527280B5</gtr:id><gtr:title>Technologies of ironic revelation: enacting consumers in neuromarkets</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Consumption Markets &amp;
