&lt;p>The character of warfare has been changing for over two decades. Received images of conventional warfare, based on highly organised and trained forces in the Second World War, have become outmoded. Both the actors in contemporary warfare and changing technological capabilities fundamentally challenge existing international law on the use of armed force involving some degree of kinetic force - that is, energy transfer through blast and fragmentation. New technical means, including cyber-technology, space warfare, electronic warfare, drone warfare, modes of sabotage, and weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, radiological, chemical or biological (or synthetic biological) and their potential application and exploitation cannot easily be accommodated within the existing legal framework, if at all. Similarly, while states remain central, there is no war, obvious or non-obvious, which does not involve non-state actors, (including Private Military Security Companies, coalitions and insurgents).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project investigates the legal and ethical dimensions of scientific and technical innovation, identifying the range of scientific and technical innovations that present the greatest challenges in terms of international humanitarian and international human rights law in both obvious and non-obvious warfare.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This research will be of benefit to broad constituencies of interest, both academic and practitioner, in both public and private spheres.

Academic: the research will be of vital interest to all engaged in research on both the changing character of warfare and the conduct of armed forces operations, at operational, strategic and policy levels; and it will be of essential interest to all engaged in research on the laws of armed conflict, international humanitarian law, international human rights law, and the ethics of war and international relations.

Practitioner: the research will be of vital interest to all engaged in conduct of armed forces operations (at operational, strategic and policy levels) in the context of the changing character of warfare, as well as other government departments, bodies and agencies engaged in aspects of peace, security and conflict, both in terms of the knowledge and understanding generated in relation to the use of technologically innovative means, but also, crucially, to the legal idiom in which they operate; it will be of essential interest to those working in public service (whether at national-government or international-international organisation/tribunal levels) as lawyers, dealing with issues of the laws of armed conflict, international humanitarian law and national and international human rights law; it will also be of strong interest to those working privately, but engaging with issues of international and non-international armed conflict in both municipal-national and international jurisdictions.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-31</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>239398</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Armed Forces &amp; Society Seminar, Bristol</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9814C94F-956B-4B3D-8317-EA45F2AED64F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation to the UK's leading military sociology seminar, on Law and the British Armed Forces, highlighting the particular challenges of autonomy and non-obvious warfare for the British Armed Forces

The first and most important research achievement was to bring together scientific and technological experts with experts in international law and international security to identify and critically to reflect on the chief characteristics of key technological and scientific innovations that have potential or actual application in the context of obvious and non-obvious warfare. These included: forms of cyber-attacks and cyber-warfare; types and uses of data; autonomous and semi-autonomous systems, including 'drones'; and chemical and biological weapons (including potential use of synthetic biology). The methodology of bringing together experts in different fields, commissioning papers from them, as well as critical written comments and significant discussion of the papers provided the mechanism by which different disciplinary and practical areas of activity could be integrated. This made the key research finding from the project (see below) possible.
2. The key research outcome is to have identified the areas where technological innovation present challenges to law and policy are, mutatis mutandis, surmountable, and those where the challenges to law and policy are more fundamental. A key finding, therefore is that existing law can accommodate technological and scientific innovation as it applies to the conduct of war - and, in the absence of specific new law, existing law should be applied as best it can. However, ambiguities will need to be resolved. In certain cases, however, the immensely difficult challenge of securing new international legislation might be required.
3.The emergence of synthetic biology presents new challenges for international law, particularly, the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). At a minimum, clarification of existing law may be necessary. Although the BWC is often perceived to present a blanket ban on all biological agents not for prophylactic or protective use, the position is more ambiguous and gives rise to new questions in an era of synthetic biology. Semantically, genetic or genome technology, is neither bacteriological nor poisonous, and, while in some circumstances, genetic manipulation might cause death, theoretically, other effects might not be classified as 'disease.' For the time being, bacteriological agents remain the likely transmission mechanism for any genetic modulation - and thus, broadly subject to a ban on their use (although the bacteriological agents would not be causing the harm themselves - another area of possible interpretive ambiguity). However, other means of delivery may be possible but outside the literal scope of the Convention, as things stand. While the broad intent to cover 'other biological agents' in the Biological Weapons Convention, should apply to synthetic biological capabilities, this needs to be made absolutely clear in the Convention's review conference process - the 8th Review Conference is set for late 2016.
4. The greatest challenges - and fears - for practitioners relate to the prospects of synthetic-biological weapons, which could target genetic markers and affect genetic make-up. The prospect of facing biological agents that could alter their very internal make-up had a more profoundly disturbing psychological impact generates more fear even than conventional combat. Some soldiers expressed the view that any such capability should be subject to a comprehensive ban. However, the theoretical potential utility of some genome capabilities was regarded more positively as something military practitioners might want.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>1. It is clear that considerable scope remains for further integration, in particular, for jointly conducted and written synthetic research across the boundaries of the three main strands feeding into the research.
2. The research we were able to conduct regarding the five permanent members of the Security Council - Russia, China, France, the USA and the UK - was mostly with regard to one aspect of technological innovation (cyber security) and, even regarding that aspect, there is considerable scope for further research. The same applies to the research we were able to conduct regarding different strands of Islamic thought on the ethics and legality of technological innovation and its use in weapons. There was considerable FCO interest in this research and there is scope for complete research projects to investigate the thinking of these states and actors across the full nexus of warfare-technology-law issues, as well as to extend it to a range of other research subjects, most notably rising and emerging powers.
3. It is clear from the engagement between the project team, DSTL and both the FCO and the MOD that there may be scope for the findings to influence the UK Government's Strategic Security and Defence Review (SDSR). Indeed, project research has already been used as part of DSTL's preparatory work for the 2016 SDSR. Each of the projects three main aspects - non-obvious warfare, technological innovation and international law - will be relevant in this context and, most of all, the interaction of the three will be an important element of the review. We will continue engagement with these different partners and organisations with a view to maximising the benefit to usefulness of the research to them.
4. The research findings have some relevance for international diplomatic and legal discussions. In particular, research findings may be of benefit in discussions regarding cyber security at the United Nations and we will continue discussions already begun with the UK Ambassador to the UN and members of the mission he leads to see if and how this might be the case. Similarly, research findings relating to synthetic biology have relevance to the Biological Weapons Review Conference and we will be exploring if and how this might be the case through contacts with the conference. Finally, both autonomy and robotics, and 'big data' and surveillance, remain highly contested issues in the public sphere and we anticipate that our research findings may well have utility in those debates.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>5C70274F-464A-4EEC-9C0B-EF7FF301748B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/warstudies/research/groups/wc/snt.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Defence Concepts and Doctrine Centre, MoD</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1E4F0E47-A261-414F-B4B4-617074F80312</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>UK SDSR</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>265B02A6-1294-44D1-9E75-A44F37CA6DCC</gtr:id><gtr:type>Citation in other policy documents</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Brunei/ASEAN Civil-Military Training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Europe</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>21EF82CA-79E7-433F-A8E1-8D66696F2D0F</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>FCO</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>297572FA-5E6E-4258-968B-817BD5DEDFF8</gtr:id><gtr:type>Implementation circular/rapid advice/letter to e.g. Ministry of Health</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Defence Intelligence Staff Training</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Asia</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>ED9AFF85-90F0-49E9-AEA9-0547DEA2F085</gtr:id><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput></gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D5C5DC2C-4F25-4C48-A070-2429D56E7DD0"><gtr:id>D5C5DC2C-4F25-4C48-A070-2429D56E7DD0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Ethics, Law and Justifying Targeted Killings: The Obama Administration at War</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/8a0a774ac61bd54a64143227ed6c9ca1"><gtr:id>8a0a774ac61bd54a64143227ed6c9ca1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>McDonald Jack</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>1138645796</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/55E2B3F3-81BE-40C7-B2D3-8066A0FF6EB8"><gtr:id>55E2B3F3-81BE-40C7-B2D3-8066A0FF6EB8</gtr:id><gtr:title>OUP Handbook on the Use of Force</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/c1865c8102a1c897f211703feb3f2fbc"><gtr:id>c1865c8102a1c897f211703feb3f2fbc</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guglielmo Verdirame</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>99780199673049</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ES/K011413/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>4511FB20-8392-418E-809D-7701FACC03C9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Law &amp; legal studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5D762B83-597E-4E91-B2F7-04CBB955175C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Pol. sci. &amp; internat. studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>EC0E734E-D9A1-463E-AB7A-CCB02E877E10</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>International Law</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DF8321C4-0BDE-4E78-8A6D-3F3FA99A9138</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>War Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
