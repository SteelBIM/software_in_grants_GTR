In the 2011 tables, the Government:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>introduced a range of new school performance measures to attempt to better measure how schools are performing for all their pupils, not just the average pupil&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>introduced a new government target that defines schools that fail to meet ?floor standards? in these new measures as ?underperforming?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>made it a government priority that all schools narrow the performance gaps between the most disadvantaged pupils in their schools and their peers. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>These changes have important implications - ?underperforming? schools will risk being placed in ?special measures?, take-over, or even closure - and it is therefore imperative that they are critically reviewed and that innovative techniques are developed and applied to explore potential improvements to the accuracy, usefulness and communication of school performance tables.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This grant will do this by pursuing a programme of methodological and substantive research using multilevel modelling, and based on secondary analyses of the Government?s highly detailed pupil and school level performance data which underlie their tables.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH? 

GROUP 1
The users of school performance tables, who need to be able to understand and correctly interpret the published statistics, will benefit from the research. This group includes: education policy makers, who use these tables to set government targets and to select schools for policy initiatives; third sector organisations, such as the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and the Sutton and Impetus Trusts, who use these tables to select schools for charitable interventions; local authorities and schools, who use these tables for performance monitoring and resource allocation; the media, who present and explain these data to the public; and the wider public themselves, who use these tables to choose which schools to send their children to and to understand how their children's schools are performing locally and nationally.

GROUP 2
The producers of the school performance tables, who need to be aware of the different statistical issues in designing and presenting school performance measures, will benefit from the research. This group includes: the DfE who produce the official school performance tables; and the Fischer Family Trust (FFT) who provide a range of additional performance data to LAs and schools to support target setting and self evaluation.

GROUP 3
The producers of other public sector performance measures, both within the UK and globally, will also benefit from the research; the issues the research will address apply to measuring institution performance in general. Within the UK, this group includes: The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) who both publish higher education performance indicators; The Department of Health (DoH) and Dr Foster who publish hospital waiting times, mortality rates, and readmission rates; and The Ministry of Justice and regional police forces who publish reoffending rates and crime maps.


HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH? 

GROUP 1
The critical review will benefit the users of school performance tables by carefully explaining: the methodology behind each school performance measure; the conclusions that each measure allows users to draw; how different measures are relevant to different users and are required for informing different types of decisions; and the notion of statistical uncertainly and risk in over interpreting small differences in schools' performances.

This group will also benefit from the substantive findings into how successful schools are at passing the government 'floor standards' target and how successful schools are at the government priority of 'narrowing the gap' between schools' most disadvantaged pupils and their peers.


GROUPS 2 &amp;amp; 3
The methodological research will benefit the producers of school and other public sector performance measures by demonstrating how their, typically descriptive, measures can be formulated as multilevel models, the advantages of doing this, and how a wide range of modelling extensions can then be applied to measure many different aspects of institutions' performances. All of this research will promote the importance of communicating the statistical uncertainty in performance measures to the end user.

This group will benefit from the online training materials which will provide step-by-step instructions on how to specify and interpret multilevel models for performance data and on how to fit these models using MLwiN and other statistical software packages.

This group will also benefit from the one-day training (morning) and research (afternoon) workshop on 'Statistical Modelling of School Performance Measures' that I will run this in the final year of the award.

The FFT will benefit from the one-week knowledge exchange placement by engaging with academic research and collaboratively working towards a co-production of knowledge in measuring schools performance.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>150601</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>National Pupil Database User Group Meeting 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>002095E4-0E41-4F0B-BCEA-5E9D783A1AB8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Provides a forum for researchers to discuss the data which underlie the Government's school performance tables.

Our key findings have been cited in a policy document by Australian New South Wales Department of Education and Communities. More generally, the work we have done on the grant and our programme of dissemination has raised our profile within the field of value-added modelling and school league tables. This has led to impact activities informed by our key findings where we have advised a number of bodies on these issues including: The Bulgarian Ministry of Education department; The Colombian Evaluation Institute; The National Centre for Educational Achievement (NCEA) / ACT testing company; The Slovak Republic National Institute for Certified Educational Measurements; and The Times and Sunday Times Data Team.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A1B5D353-0AE1-4AC9-BA0A-220E065A18F1</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This grant funded three years of intensive research on England's Government school performance tables. The grant focused on statistically critiquing and comparing various school performance measures published in these tables, especially value-added and progress measures. We have debated the Governments justifications for withdrawing their contextual value-added measure. We have drawn attention to fundamental design issues in the current expected progress measures. We have also questioned the ability with which socioeconomic achievement gaps, especially the extent to which these gaps can be narrowed over time, can be usefully reported at the school-level.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our findings might be taken forward by other academic researchers in how they make use or not of the various published school performance measures we have critiqued in this grant. For example, researchers may well go on to develop improved versions of various school performance measures guided by the limitations we have highlighted of existing measures. The findings might also be used by Government (Department for Education) in how they better design future school performance measures as well as the increasingly large number of charity and commercial companies who use the published school performance measures in performance monitoring systems which they sell to schools (e.g., Fischer Family Trust).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>C451E7EA-410F-4874-A936-6EF843633A7D</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.bristol.ac.uk/cmm/research/mm-gov-new-school-performance/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Participated
