We must look ahead strategically and adapt the UK's priorities swiftly and appropriately to address the research and educational demands arising from China's emergence, as what many today are calling &amp;quot;the Chinese century&amp;quot; unfolds. The UK Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office's 2010 strategy document, 'The UK and China: A framework for engagement', stated bluntly that &amp;quot;China's impact on UK interests is already critical, and it is growing.&amp;quot; One of the aims it set out for shaping the UK's response was 'equipping the British people to seize the China opportunity through better understanding of China and better Chinese language skills', and through 'increased educational and scientific links at institutional level between universities, research bodies, colleges and schools, and a greater two way flow of students, academics and researchers'. The objective of BICC's programme of activity is to inform and contribute to these strategically vital processes.

In BICC the universities of Bristol, Manchester and Oxford combined forces to develop the UK's premier teaching and research facility on China. Each of the three partner institutions has already embarked on a major investment in this area, thus leveraging the long-term impact that the grant will have. In the course of the five years of the grant, BICC has already delivered 
1. A range of cutting-edge research projects on strategic topics;
2. An extensive programme for user engagement and the dissemination of research results;
3. A comprehensive network of coordinated teaching programmes on modern and classical Chinese language and all aspects Chinese studies.
This activity continues and continues to deliver significant and internationally important results. 

In its second phase, BICC will foreground the building of new knowledge exchange partnerships with non-academic organisations, and the inauguration of new international research networks, in which knowledge exchange activities will be embedded, all of this activity being grounded in language expertise, and supported by a new programme of language training for university and non-university researchers in Chinese studies. Partners who have already committed themselves to hosting student or postdoctoral researcher placements include government (Foreign &amp;amp; Commonwealth Office, Meteorological Office), think-tanks and NGOs in the UK and in China (Chatham House, United Nations Research Institute for Social Development, chinadialogue, Beijing Little Bird Center), and large corporations (Penguin Books China, John Swire &amp;amp; Sons). Research network partners include organisations in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, France and the UK, will focus through 9 networks on three overarching themes, 'Borders', 'Cultures of Change', and 'History for the Present', and will involve academic and non-academic participants.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Policy
China remains a key area of growing attention for policy-makers. The culture and history of China, and the history of China-UK relations have been shown to be critical areas of foreign policy interest, and will be addressed through our portfolio of networking and placement partnerships. BICC researchers at the FCO will have a direct impact on policy-making by writing reports for internal circulation and giving a presentation to its in-house seminar series, which involves the MoD, DfID and BIS. The researcher at the United Nations Research Institute for Social Development will have a direct impact on a key government policy issue - migration - through their research seminar and working paper. Researchers and students at the Chatham House and chinadialogue think tanks will directly impact public policy debate through presentations and publication. Students and researchers at NGOs will impact activities in China's growing civil society; working with BICC researchers and students will build capacity for transnational policy advocacy in China, and their reports and outreach plan will impact how these issues are addressed in Beijing.

BICC Phase 2's research networks will impact policy as follows. Network co-ordinators will include government offices in planning network activities, and in workshops and conferences. FCO has expressed much interest in historical approaches to UK-China relations, so BICC will include it in the 'Chinese Urban Studies' and 'The Chinese 1950s' networks. BICC will also use research networks to pursue new ties with government and policy-makers: BIS will be invited to participate in the 'Cultures of Consumption' network as China's domestic market will be one of the drivers of the 21st century global economy. The 'Borders of Migration' research network will be of interest to the UNRISD and the FCO. Research produced by the 'Borders of Sexuality and Desire' and 'Borders of Knowledge Politics' networks will impact government departments, think tanks and NGOs that are concerned with human rights issues. These user groups will be involved in planning and execution of network activities.

Science
BICC will work with NGO and scientific partners to apply arts and humanities research to develop capacity in Environmental Change research, an RCUK priority area. The BICC researcher at the Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Change Research will build links with Chinese partners. Their exploration of Chinese sources will directly impact scientific understanding of environmental change. The researcher and student at chinadialogue and the 'Environment and Culture' research network will impact the scientific understanding of environmental change by working with officials and NGOs. The 'Environment and Culture' network co-ordinator will organise the activities to extend and enhance her communication and collaboration with the China Environment and Health Initiative, an NGO in Beijing. This research network and chinadialogue will also impact debate about environmental change through publications: internet blogs and the research network's conference volume. The 'Digital China: Heritage, Learning, Research' network work will add to scientific impact by exploring how new technological innovation can support teaching and learning in Chinese studies.

Business
Since China's domestic market will be one of the drivers of the global economy in the 21st century, business needs to exploit the UK's comparative advantage of historical and cultural studies. UK business will benefit from interaction with HEI expertise that can help firms better position themselves to exploit the rich history of Anglo-Chinese cultural relations, and of UK HEI Chinese studies expertise. Researchers placed at Penguin Books China and John Swire &amp;amp; Sons Ltd. will have direct impacts on the way firms use this expertise and historical legacies in their strategies for growth and development in China.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-08-12</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-02-13</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>409516</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Since Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the 'China Dream' as his official slogan in November 2012, many people inside and outside the PRC have been asking 'What is the China Dream?'

They came in all shapes: televisions, telephones, and cars; tigers, elephants, and giraffes; pistols, Maotai bottles, and brandy bottles; violins, pianos, and Laughing Buddhas. In one year, I collected over 200 different pencil sharpeners.

The Chinese party-state seems to encourage such obsessions. Its political campaigns from the 1950s to the 1980s produced not only a plethora of slogans, but also a wide range of collectable communist consumer items: Mao badges, propaganda posters, postage stamps, and mugs inscribed with political messages.

To mark the 50th anniversary of the start of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-76), this short documentary film explores the everyday experience of revolution and reform by examining these cultural artifacts, and the people who collected them.

To get a sense of the Cultural Revolution's revolutionary fervor and its Maoist cult of personality, it considers the era's mass-produced material culture: Mao badges and enamel mugs, both of which were signs of revolutionary modernity.

Starting in 1978, Deng Xiaoping's economic reform and opening policy offered an alternative development strategy: the China model of authoritarian capitalism. Modernity here switches from revolutionary idealism to the mass consumerism that we see in China today. Maoism thus becomes a consumer activity, as seen in the English-language souvenir version of the &amp;quot;Little Red Book.&amp;quot; The pencil sharpeners mentioned above mirror the consumer dreams promised by Deng's economic reforms: the &amp;quot;four rounds&amp;quot; (bicycle, wristwatch, sewing machine, and washing machine) and the &amp;quot;three electrics&amp;quot; (television, refrigerator, and telephone), as well as the traditional culture of the Laughing Buddha. (Back in the US in 1986, I noticed that Chinese students were collecting the real things to send home: large fridge-freezers, TVs and computers.)

What do people collect now that urban China is little different from anywhere else? Some circle back to the beginning: the last artifact is a pair of traditional &amp;quot;grass shoes&amp;quot; (caoxie) from a village in the mountains of central China. When bought in 2006, they represented the opposite of the alternative modernities of revolution and reform: as the essence of traditional China, grass shoes are worn by old peasants, and shunned by young people from the city. Although unfashionable, grass shoes are still very practical, and quite comfy for a walk in the hills.

This diverse set of artifacts from the PRC's recent past gives us a tactile sense of the dramatic changes that Chinese people have experienced over the past 50 years. As chronicled in Tim O'Brien's iconic Vietnam War novel, The Things They Carried (1990), the things we collect not only tell us about exotic places-they also tell us about ourselves.</gtr:description><gtr:id>323961A3-F4D4-40E4-8DE1-55D3D8311606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This film is posted on The Diplomat.com, and generated much interest.

The house was so large that the Japanese turned it into a hospital during World War II. I always wondered what happened to Uncle Chuck's house. I started coming to China myself in 1985, but before I could ask him for the address, he had passed away. Over the years, street names changed and the address was lost. Nobody in the family even knew where to look. Only memories and mythologies remained.

A few years ago, I decided to track down Uncle Chuck's house. What I found were strange and interesting things about my family and about the life of 'Shanghailanders', which is what foreigners called themselves in the 1930s. Chuck was a typical small-town Midwestern guy who pursued the American Dream of fame and fortune; but he is remarkable because he realised this dream in China. While most China-bound Americans worked as Christian missionaries to build schools and hospitals, Chuck was different: he was a merchant banker who led the American Cowboys polo team to victory over the Brits. He was interned by the Imperial Japanese Army in 1942, returned to Shanghai after the war to re-stake his claim, and then escaped to Hong Kong just before the People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai in 1949.

An American in Shanghai traces the personal history of my uncle in Shanghai from 1924 to 1949 to illuminate new views of China's modern history of imperialism, war, revolution, and now, rejuvenation. It shows how people like Chuck used the advantages of imperial system, such as extraterritorial protection, to build a fabulous life-often at the expense of their Chinese competitors. This short film is also an experiment, exploring different ways of doing and presenting academic research. Rather than just search for the 'facts', it traces the experiences and feelings of Americans in Shanghai in the 1930s - and the 2010s. Inspired by the work of Walter Benjamin and Roland Barthes, it mixes personal stories and professional analysis, with the goal of creatively 'thinking visually' and 'feeling visually'.

But An American in Shanghai is more than an exploration of imperial history, US-China relations, or new research methods.

It is a mystery story: is Chuck's house still there? If I find it, will the new owners let me in to take a look?</gtr:description><gtr:id>53ABB65A-723B-44ED-91B1-E3A667B12B7F</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Published on a top Chinese studies website: Australia National University's The China Story.

In this spirit, in 2014 I started working on a documentary film, toilet adventures, that explores the politics of shit in China. It uses on-camera interviews with dozens of participants to explore the very mundane personal experience of going to the bathroom in the PRC. I thought this would be an entertaining way to chart how people encounter the unknown through a bodily function that is both intimate and universal.



The film thus is part of Enloe's broader project that shifts away from the state-to-state framing of mainstream IR to explore issues at the cutting edge of critical IR and China studies: the role of person-to-person relations, the importance of the everyday, and the value of emotions and embodied knowledge. The goal is to provide a nuanced view of encounters with the unknown-in this case, Chinese public toilets-and to show how different people addressed this alien situation, often with good humor: there was a lot of laughing as people recounted their uncomfortable experiences.

Certainly, toilet adventures risks descending into the clich&amp;eacute; of middle-class people experiencing structural poverty for the first time in the 'Third World': e.g. Delhi belly. Such funny stories are political in the sense that they distinguish insiders from outsiders: there is always 'the butt of the joke', in this case China or India. Since Edward Said's path-breaking study Orientalism was published in 1978, critical scholars have been concerned with the power/knowledge dynamic in the West's relationship with China. This raises a serious question for my film: does it play into the stereotype of China as an exotic place that, although achieving much progress, is still 'behind' the 'advanced' West? In other words, is toilet adventures an Orientalist film?

That is up to each viewer to determine.

But I will say that making this odd film helped me to understand China and the world in a new way. While Orientalism assumes that only the West can dominate the power/knowledge dynamic, what about China as a rising power that increasingly dominates its own region through what Beijing calls 'discursive power' ????

Indeed, the film project actually started in ways that jam the dominant East/West polemic: rather than stemming from white male complaints about the PRC, the idea for toilet adventures actually was sparked by Thai women's mixed feelings about China and its lavatorial infrastructure. This, for me, was a post-Orientalist moment that opened up new ways of understanding China and its relationship with the world.

As well as providing a more nuanced view of reactions to China, toilet adventures raises a set of questions about what counts as knowledge. The film's participants certainly provide plenty of facts to answer the 'where', 'when', and 'how' questions of going to the bathroom in rural China. However, even with all these facts on display, the main point is not rational in the sense of providing an 'accurate' representation of the PRC. Films are interesting because they allow us to appreciate the 'affect' of emotional and bodily knowledge: the cringes that we see on participants' faces when they recall coming face-to-face with a dirty, smelly squat toilet for the first time, the uncomfortable laughs provoked when the private becomes public, and the cathartic sighs when the experience is complete.

Rather than just gather the 'facts' of peoples' experiences, documentary films thus can illustrate the estrangement, the giddiness, and thus the excess evoked by such encounters. Indeed, toilet adventures shows how bowel movements can provoke emotional movement, and even political mobilization.

Such images of everyday practices-and everyday vulnerabilities-in China underline IR theorist Kimberly Hutchings's apt observation that 'producing knowledge is a messy business'. toilet adventures provides a post-Orientalist opportunity because it both reinscribes and resists the dominant East/West discourse by refiguring it in a strange place: Chinese toilets.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A0D7BA8C-71AD-45EC-9FC2-D39D0E994B4D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The film was shortlisted for an AHRC Filmmaking award in 2015.
