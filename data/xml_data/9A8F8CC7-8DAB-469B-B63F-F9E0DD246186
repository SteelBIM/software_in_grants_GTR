Our general approach is to treat synaesthesia as a 'test case' to address other important research questions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For instance, we consider how synaesthesia can inform general theories of memory. Importantly, not all aspects of memory are enhanced in synaesthesia and this can provide insights into how the memory system is structured. Indeed it is not trivially the case that material that elicits 'extra' sensations are better remembered: some material that does not evoke extra sensations (such as abstract figures) are also better remembered by synaesthetes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We suggest that synaesthetes have widespread changes in their perceptual systems (including but not limited to their extra experiences) and that systems supporting perception can also be engaged in memory. We will use both standard and bespoke tests of memory to explore which aspects of memory are enhanced and we will explore how individual differences in perception (in non-synaesthetes) may relate to performance on certain memory tasks.&lt;br />&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who? The general public and the media.
How? The general public and the media has an enduring fascination with synaesthesia. The notion that people can experience the world in fundamentally different ways (e.g. some people can see music in addition to hearing it) has significant implications for art and culture, for policy (e.g. how we teach people who differ), and for science. For many lay people, the fact that science can take seriously one's inner experiences of the world is genuinely surprising (given the commonly held view that science is 'objective' and experience is 'subjective'). Our research tackles such preconceptions. We have a first-rate track record of engaging with the general public through public science events and through the national and international media. The topic of memory ability in synaesthesia is likely to attract significant attention and in the 'Pathways to Impact' we describe how we will manage this.

Who? People with synaesthesia.
How? People with synaesthesia will benefit directly by gaining a better understanding of their own experiences and abilities. 

Who? Educational workers (teachers, educational psychologists, policy makers) and parents
How? Current UK educational policy and practice recognizes that children learn in different ways and at different rates, and are not necessarily equally strong in all areas. However, determining what works well for individual children can often be little more than trial-and-error. Through a better scientific understanding of individual differences (such as those accompanying synaesthesia) it will be possible to adopt a more informed and targeted approach. As researchers of synaesthesia, some of our most common email enquiries comes from parents of children with synaesthesia who are concerned (or curious) about how synaesthesia will affect their learning. As such there is a clear need for accessible, and evidence-based, information that is available. 

Who? Policy-makers with an interest in ageing.
How? Our research is relevant to the RCUK objective of understanding &amp;quot;how we manage the consequences of an ageing population&amp;quot;. It also fits well with the ESRC's strategic priority of &amp;quot;a vibrant and fair society&amp;quot; insofar as we seek to understand the diversity of human experience. Although we focus our research on synaesthesia, the scientific framework in which we situate our findings is concerned with how individual differences in ability (and individual differences in cognitive style) are predictive of later age-related memory decline. This will enable more accurate projections of the costs of an ageing population as well as, potentially, suggesting novel interventions.

Who? Clinicians with an interest in memory.
How? In addition to academic researchers interested in memory (discussed in 'Academic Beneficiaries'), clinicians working in the NHS will benefit from our research. Clinical assessments of memory are concentrated on ability (e.g. ranking an individual on a percentile scale), rather than cognitive style (whether an individual tends to focus on relational, conceptual or perceptual aspects of stimuli/events). Our research looks at the interaction between ability and style, and has implications for other populations who present with unusual memory problems (e.g. in developmental disorders such as autism).</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319466</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Talk at 'University of Third Age' (U3A) in Lewes</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CB6710E-6958-4A2C-ABC6-D55A83863DA8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Talk at U3A (Lewes) about synesthesia, memory and ageing to 50+ elderly people</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>UKSA talk on autism, savantism and synaesthesia</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>40C46964-0540-48EE-99C5-F2D195A5444A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The presentation was given by PhD Student (James Hughes) who described data showing that synaesthesia is more prevalent in savantism (special abilities) in autism, rather than autism per se.

The project has discovered the origin of these differences within a framework of normative (cognitive and brain-based) models of memory. In many studies we have shown that the memory advantage of synaesthetes is pervasive: that is, it occurs for a wide variety of material tested in a wide variety of formats and that is largely independent of the strategy used. Within normative models of memory we suggest that this reflects enhanced encoding (and possibly enhanced retention) that itself is due to enhancements within the (primarily visual) perceptual system, but is not due to the presence of 'extra' experiences per se.

Synaesthesia is linked not only to performance enhancements but is linked to a different ways of thinking (or 'cognitive style'): put simply, they are more inclined to think using visual images. This is further corroborated by brain imaging studies showing how synaesthetes use parts of the brain involved in perception to support memory, different from controls.

One unanticipated outcome that we are exploring further, is the fact that synaesthetes appear to have better 'meta-cognition' (they have more insight into the accuracy of their memories) that appears independent from the memory enhancement itself.

Our research has shown that the memory enhancement of synaesthetes is retained in the elderly, although synaesthetes show a normal rate of age-related memory decline (they simply start from a higher point). 

A PhD Studentship linked to this grant (still ongoing), is exploring the relationship between synaesthesia and autism, in particular savant syndrome (unusual abilities). We have shown that whilst synaesthesia is more prevalent in autism, this is due to an increased prevalence amongst those people with autism and savant syndrome. We have determined that this may relate to particular cognitive styles/abilities such as systemising and attention-to-detail.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The present research considers young and old adults, but a crucial next step is to consider development during childhood. The fact that synaesthetes have different abilities and styles has important implications for education. The Co-I on this grant (Simner) has an ERC Consolidator grant exploring synaesthesia throughout the lifespan.

Relatedly, the PhD student appointed on this grant (who started later than anticipated) is exploring the links between synaesthesia, autism, and savant syndrome. Synaesthesia and autism have shown to co-occur more than expected by chance, but the underpinning principle that links them together is unknown (could it be perceptual hyper-sensitivity and 'visual thinking'?). Similarly, the special abilities found in autism may be linked to synaesthestic (or synaesthesia-like) traits.

In terms of further academic questions, our research opens up new possibilities for exploring old questions. For instance, what (exactly) is the relationship between perception, imagery, and memory?</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>9596DC17-80ED-45B9-93E9-9ADC5487B914</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and
