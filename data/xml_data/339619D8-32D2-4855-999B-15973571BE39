This builds on our success during the first phase of the project, and we will work closely with our partners across a range of time periods and themes. Community groups will receive tailored advice from a member of the research team on their specific needs and projects, as well as accessing a variety of skills-based training sessions offered by the University of East Anglia on a range of topics, such as copyright, the use of digital media, database management and similar themes.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal will make a significant impact within those communities where we will be directly supporting All Our Stories projects. Following on from the postive impact of our Phase 1 project, the Ideas Bank, communities will continue to benefit in practical ways by having the opportunity to utilise the expertise that is available from researchers at the UEA and from our community partners. Our project will help to build a greater sense of place at a highly localised level, ensuring that community identity and heritage does not become obscured by the ever pressing demands of coping with the current economic climate and in fact, takes its rightful place in encouraging community cohesion and resilience for the future. All Our Stories projects will have the opportunity to work closely with academic researchers in relevant subject areas at the UEA during the course of their projects. They will benefit directly from the advice and expertise of researchers from schools across the Faculty of Arts and Humanities and the Community University Engagement office, as well as a tailored training programme of workshops to support their activities in a broader sense. 

Alongside those directly involved in delivering All Our Stories project, the wider public will also benefit from the proposal. This is particularly true of those communities within which an All Our Stories project is taking place, but where the research is being carried out by a small group such as a local history society. Those members of the community which attend events, participate in some elements of the research, or which make use of educational packs and other materials created by the All Our Stories projects will be benefitting from the expertise and advice fed into those projects by the research team at the UEA.

Our community partners will have the opportunity to, for example, enhance their learning and development programme for staff and volunteers e.g. building research and project management skills. They will also be able to deepen their understanding of the UEA's research expertise in community heritage and to build on their existing community relationships. In particular, our partners will be encouraged to develop new community partnerships centred on HLF funded projects that uncover as yet unexplored community heritage and narratives.

The impact of the research and the various outputs produced by All Our Stories projects and informed by the research team will also have an impact upon the professional heritage sector. Datasets incorporating census and archival material, collections of old photographs and oral history recordings can all be fed into the collections and resources of local museums and record offices. Any archaeological data collected as part of these project will be submitted to the local Historic Environment Record in the relevant county, where it can be accessed by researchers, the general public, local planning teams and developers.

Our use of online media, including a blog, e-newsletters and various downloadable resources, will be of particular importance in disseminating the results of the overarching Ideas Bank project, as well as the achievements of each All Our Stories project. We will be able to highlight events, training opportunities and examples of best practice to any individual or group interested in community heritage. Community groups across the UK, who are interested in their heritage will be able to access these resources, regardless of whether they have successfully been granted Heritage Lottery Funding under the All Our Stories scheme.

Professor Rob Walker of the Centre for Applied Research in Education at the UEA will carry out a detailed impact evaluation of our project, including the collation and analysis of feedback gathered from the project blog and events. He will also carry out detailed interviews and evaluation with the AoS projects that we will be directly supporting.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-01-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>65722</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>A series of short films created in November 2013 to celebrate the Ideas Bank project and to showcase the All Our Stories projects and community groups supported by the Ideas Bank team.</gtr:description><gtr:id>8D2D26B4-E451-424D-8284-38B03D71F6BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Increased interest in the Ideas Bank project, and in working with the UEA on HLF funded projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Ideas Bank films</gtr:title><gtr:type>Film/Video/Animation</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://ideasbankatuea.wordpress.com/project-films/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Workshop and Fieldwork - Thompson (Pathways and Ideas Bank)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C40D6963-A366-43F1-8DA0-08612186E085</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A research workshop and fieldwork activities with the local history group in Thompson, including discussion of evidence from archival sources and field evidence.

We explored the range of activities and aim to identify the most suitable ones that could help tell your story to school pupils. Activities might be a performance, experiment, workshop, talk, learning resource, exhibition, or mentoring programme. The workshop was aimed at those with little or no prior experience of working with schools, but those projects with more experience were warmly invited to come along to discuss school engagement, and to share their own experiences.

We considered the different audiences that can be reached by a variety of media, and the practicalities of using digital media, including storage and archiving. The workshop also included a simple, 'how to' session on setting your own Facebook page, Twitter account, or blog. It took place in an IT lab so that each participant had their own computer to work on, and was aimed at those with little prior experience of using digital media.

Particular attention was paid to the differences in style demanded by different forms of output: best tips were shared for writing for websites, leaflets, exhibitions, history books, and oral presentations. Consideration was also given to the effects of writing from different perspectives: do you want to create a fictional narrator guide? How do you create objective or emotional tones? Should the story of the object be told? Do you need to make a large amount of factual details legible and easy to navigate? How do you produce material that will inform those who are completely unfamiliar with your material as well as engage experts in your area? This workshop was designed primarily for those who had yet to formulate plans for writing up their research. However, groups who had already begun such processes and who were keen to share their experiences were also encouraged to attend.

All Our Stories grantees shared their own experiences of writing for different audiences and in different contexts, and all produced written outputs as part of their own HLF projects.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://ideasbankatuea.wordpress.com/workshops/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Workshop - Copyright and Publishing (Ideas Bank Phase 2)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8E1FE69D-AE49-419F-B79A-B7BEF23E032B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This workshop for All Our Stories grantees provided clarity and information about copyright in general, informing attendees of what can and cannot be done under current law and licences, and suggesting ways in which copyright issues can be managed.

Our activities during Phase 2 took the form of a series of generic workshops for the project, direct support and advice to individual projects by the project team, and the creation of online resources via a new project blog aimed at the groups. All the provision and support reflected the needs of the projects as identified in Phase 1 and via further dialogue.

A series of films that can be shared with the wider community (both inside and outside academia) demonstrated the strong links between community groups and the UEA generated by the project. A particular achievement of the project has been to consolidate the relationships between university researchers and the wider community, and to build new relationships both with community groups and partner organisations around the region.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The findings from this phase of the project could be used by academics interested in the role and value of heritage within local communities, and by anyone interested in developing close working relationships between community groups and universities. Our final evaluation found that &amp;nbsp;funding is important for community groups, in part because it makes some activities possible, but more importantly because it signals recognition from outside the community. While the work of a group of enthusiasts is essential, recognition by an outside body makes the work more objective and more valuable in the eyes of participants. The work of volunteers is essential to success. Their levels of motivation and commitment are variable and learning how best to manage their involvement is critical.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>824B92A4-41B6-43A3-9070-CB53763ADBF8</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://ideasbankatuea.wordpress.com</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K007777/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>6AECCE8F-D1A3-43C8-B6DC-7B2289BE3CBF</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>541CDC75-F361-4961-9EFE-34B2C8ACE947</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>History</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ACF80B6E-2900-42FE-9B9B-C84E295EA0AC</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DCE73056-5E3D-4976-B573-234E5FF4D633</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Economic &amp; Social History</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>A13B0A82-1932-4A2E-8E26-2E1D6451CA27</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Industrial Archaeology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>F59367AF-7012-441B-9AD6-B360A3DFA96B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Landscape &amp; Environ.
