Sociology and Neuroscience, through a Study of Mental Life and The City.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>ES/L003074/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>&lt;p>Sociology has always had ideas about the ?nature? of the human subject. But what should sociologists make of recent biological research that changes our understanding of the kinds of creatures that human beings are? We now know a lot about the biological possibilities that shape human lives - and, especially, via the neurosciences, about mental health problems that can alter those lives. But we also know that neurobiology is fashioned by the body?s environments, by social relations, culture, and daily life. This suggests a transformative moment in the relationship between the social and biological sciences - or, following Carl Woese?s proposal for biology,'a new sociology for a new century.'&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project focuses on ?urbanicity?: the relationship between the social and neurological life of urban citizens, with particular attention to mental health. This is an historical interest in the social sciences, also now receiving particular attention in the neurobiological and psychiatric sciences. The project connects these interests through two methods:&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
 

 &lt;li>through conceptual and historical investigation, it clarifies, and ?re-vitalises? their historical relationship&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>it brings neuroscientists and sociologists together in two workshops, creating a shared protocol for future research that can think both sociologically and neurologically about wellbeing and the city.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ol></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>'A New Sociology for a New Century' represents social science engagements with ongoing transformations in the life sciences; the project focuses on the development of interdisciplinary research questions around mental life and urban citizenship. As such, our project has potential economic and societal impacts in three areas: It will create and inspire social science research and networks that take positive contributions to health and economic outcomes to be a key motivating factor in interdisciplinary work; it will contribute to research and knowledge about positive mental health outcomes for citizens inhabiting urban environments; it will add to our understanding of the mental health risks and resiliences involved in 21st century demographic dynamics of urban citizenship, including patterns of immigration and migration; ethnic inclusion and exclusion; and economic support and work opportunities. Poor mental health impacts significantly on family life, work, and individual wellbeing; therefore the work of this project has clear potential impacts for society and the economy. 

There are three clear beneficiaries of our research: 1. Academics whose research in distinct disciplines, be these social science disciplines or life science disciplines, will benefit from interdisciplinary collaborations in order to generate more holistic more innovative and more impactful research studies as a result of collaboration; 2. Policy-makers whose remit involves ensuring that the growing global 'burden' of mental illness does not continue to negatively impact capacities across a wide economic spectrum; e.g. urban social service organisations and multinational corporations; 3. Mental health services (including psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, care-workers and others) who require better understanding of the risks and resiliences of diverse groups of urban citizens, in order to ensure appropriate mechanisms and tools for identification, support and interventions aimed at supporting mental health and wellbeing for urban citizens across the lifespan.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-08-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>194776</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>School of Social Science and Public Policy</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Geography</gtr:department><gtr:description>The Stress of the Urban</gtr:description><gtr:id>ABE7E697-86A2-4DC7-8924-FC059409A9FA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is the first of two core events attached to this partnership; outcomes, which should include a shared interdisciplinary research project to move the work of this grant forward, will be manifested at the end of the second workshop in February 2015.

The key achievement against these goals were:
New knowledge generated about the relationships between the biological and social sciences
We showed that there are substantive empirical and conceptual links between sociological and neuroscientific work on urban stress that are not widely-known or appreciated by scholars on either side - which then stymies interdisciplinary efforts. We did this through a detailed reading of contemporary and historical literatures in different disciplines - demonstrating the way in which central themes and methods of sociological work on the city, from the 1930s and 1940s, survive in neuroscientific and psychological work today. We submitted these results to key UK sociological journals (one article is accepted at the British Journal of Sociology; one is under review at The Sociological Review) in order to create new pathways for sociologists who are interested in collaborating with colleagues in the life sciences. We also disseminated this work in open access public forums including Discover Society, The Conversation and The Independent. We are now engaged in discussions with relevant policy communities in the UK, in China, and in Brazil on the development of action research programmes that will actively involve policy development. These are currently at an early stage and ongoing, but we are working in four cities in particular (Shanghai, London, Toronto and Sao Paola) and establishing the outline of a comparative programme between interdisciplinary experts form these cities. The first part of that programme (a study of migrant mental health in Shanghai) is now funded, and data collection will begin in 2016.

Development of noteworthy and new international partnerships and collaborations
We generated significant new collaborations in this project - across both disciplinary and cultural boundaries. Workshops not only brought together experts from the UK, Brazil, China, Canada, and Germany among others - but, crucially, established a sustainable, ongoing collaboration between key experts from different disciplines and countries. The first of these collaborations, which is a study of migrant mental health in Shanghai, and involves teams from the UK and China, will begin its collaboration in early 2016, and plans are underway to next extend these concrete collaborations with teams in Brazil and Canada. Thus a major (and ongoing) new interdisciplinary and international network on urban mental health was established during this project,</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>AE1033B3-B83E-4A03-9F44-6C7186F095EB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>There is now a significant amount of evidence telling us that psychological and psychiatric problems related to urban stress have both biological and social roots. However, while there is a great deal of neurobiological and epidemiological work on the biological markings of stressful city living, and a great deal of sociological and anthropological work on its social aspects, these two research-areas rarely talk to one another - and even more rarely still collaborate on shared projects. The goal of this grant is to begin to close this gap, so that we can better understand the stresses of urban life - especially as they produce psychological problems.

The aims of the grant are thus two-fold: first, we wish to discover whether there are any connections to be drawn between, on the one hand, sociological work (going back a century or so) that has used ethnographic and social-science methods to understand 'mental life and the city' and, on the other hand, neuroscientific work (which has really only emerged in the last decade or so) that uses the tools of functional neuroimaging to discover the biological markings of 'urban stress.' The point of seeking those connections is to assess whether these two research areas - which have many similar questions, but very different methods - might not be joined up, and become more than the sum of their parts. Second, we wish to discover if we can bring experts from these very different disciplines together, in order to formulate a research strategy for uncovering the still poorly-understood relationship between urban life and mental distress - so that we can collectively produce a much richer understanding of the conjoined social and biological forces that underpin this phenomenon. The point of putting these together is that there is now much evidence that in order to understand and intervene on the problems produced by city living, these disciplines will need to learn to work together. 

We have indeed found that there are very strong connections between the history of sociological work in this area, and the more contemporary neuroscientific research. In a paper currently under review, we use historical and conceptual analysis to show: (1) that many of the ideas produced within urban sociology can be used to inform neurobiological research; and also (2) that learning to connect with biological methods can help sociologists to recover these aspects of their own disciplines, thus finding new sources of impact for sociological knowledge. 

We have also found that there are questions common to sociological, epidemiological, psychiatric and neuroscientific researchers in this area - and that it is possible for these researchers to design a common project that unites their different knowledges. In three transdisciplinary workshops that we ran in September 2014, February 2015 and at the end of the grant, researchers from these disciplines shared methods, issues and questions - showing, for example, how ethnographic work with residents of ordinary streets can help epidemiologists to get a better grasp of what people mean when they talk about stress, or how psychiatric work on the relationship between stressful environments and neurodevelopment can expand sociological work on urban inequalities. This has provided the basis for a further award funded under the ESRC Newton scheme, for a case study of Mental Health, Migration and the Megacity, undertaken in Shanghai with the collaboration of Fudan University.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>While the findings of this grant are related to the conceptual and institutional framework through which these very different research agendas might be put together, we anticipate that a shared biological-neurobiological programme of research on urban stress (which will extend beyond the lifetime of this grant) will be of use to mental health experts including clinicians and service planners; urban planners and policymakers including local authorities; and both governmental and non-governmental organisations interested in questions of urban equality, and democracy.

We anticipate the direct findings of this grant (on, for example, the connections between sociological and neurobiological work) to be of particular interest to scholars in the social, neuro, and psychiatric sciences who work on questions of urban stress and density, as well as on the social life of cities more generally. We anticipate our model of collaboration (including the historical arguments underpinning it) to be of interest to funders and research managers, as well as scholars, and others more generally, who are seeking novel and effective models of interdisciplinary collaboration.

Our carefully-designed workshop forced participants to address a common theme, from the perspective of their own research, and then to break into sub-groups, in order to design an interdisciplinary research proposal on one of the core sub-themes of our project. Our original workshop method was designed to disrupt the normal model of interdisciplinary exchange, and engage participants in really confronting, and incorporating, insights form other disciplines.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4D5AD6E3-265B-4E69-9F7B-076F114C9241</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This process is still in train, but we hope that it will produce the first UK-based truly transdisciplinary collaborative project around the theme of urban stress, which unites methodological tools from sociology, geography, anthropology, psychiatry, epidemiology and other disciplines - which very rarely work together.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Transdisciplinary Workshop</gtr:title><gtr:type>Improvements to research infrastructure</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AD313611-76E2-403E-97CC-F21039AD6B37"><gtr:id>AD313611-76E2-403E-97CC-F21039AD6B37</gtr:id><gtr:title>Urban Life and Mental Health: Re-visiting Politics, Society and Biology</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Discover Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d96ae8c1c88e06bbb77abc59778941f1"><gtr:id>d96ae8c1c88e06bbb77abc59778941f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fitzgerald, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BE21EFF3-D2F4-4A44-A1E5-7DA59452F477"><gtr:id>BE21EFF3-D2F4-4A44-A1E5-7DA59452F477</gtr:id><gtr:title>Handbook of Biology and Society</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/5a2dcdd9174846e6c4f355a77795c48d"><gtr:id>5a2dcdd9174846e6c4f355a77795c48d</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>n/a</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/BA44BAD7-60D6-42FF-A9F7-7141BCB06B0A"><gtr:id>BA44BAD7-60D6-42FF-A9F7-7141BCB06B0A</gtr:id><gtr:title>Sociology, Psychiatry and Urbanicity: Re-vitalizing the Archive.</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d96ae8c1c88e06bbb77abc59778941f1"><gtr:id>d96ae8c1c88e06bbb77abc59778941f1</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Fitzgerald, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1E6D8E6F-85BE-4F3D-8DC2-A3598FC00A2F"><gtr:id>1E6D8E6F-85BE-4F3D-8DC2-A3598FC00A2F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mental Life in the Metropolis: urban brains, urban lives and the embodiment of urbanicity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b461f0df6b02273f3220efad941a3f7c"><gtr:id>b461f0df6b02273f3220efad941a3f7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rose, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6EC6D1F4-6E22-4752-BB5B-DA33A8D09183"><gtr:id>6EC6D1F4-6E22-4752-BB5B-DA33A8D09183</gtr:id><gtr:title>Mental Life in the Metropolis: urban brains, urban lives and the embodiment of urbanicity</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/b461f0df6b02273f3220efad941a3f7c"><gtr:id>b461f0df6b02273f3220efad941a3f7c</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Rose, N</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/EF442F08-B12B-483D-AC70-D0CB1786BE55"><gtr:id>EF442F08-B12B-483D-AC70-D0CB1786BE55</gtr:id><gtr:title>Living Well in the Neuropolis - Stress, City Life, and the Biosocial Complex of Urban Citizenship</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>n/a</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/36f875db485c6393b7f42dedcbd89041"><gtr:id>36f875db485c6393b7f42dedcbd89041</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>D.
