The environment for participants is truly exceptional: a dedicated and purpose-designed building; office, computing and superb library support, including 35,000 books in Mathematical Sciences within 50 metres of the Institute; the opportunity to interact with the wider community at Cambridge; and experienced staff who know what works, and who provide full support to organisers and participants to enable them to focus on their science. Visitor programmes are generally of six, four or one month's duration. There are usually two programmes running in parallel, each with around 20 scientists in residence. Programmes include particularly intense periods of instructional courses and workshops for 100 or more scientists, which are frequently held elsewhere in the UK, to maximise opportunity for the UK community and access for young scientists. The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) is a group of distinguished scientists with very broad experience, who are at the heart of a rigorous process to ensure that every programme is of the highest quality. Any group of researchers can submit a proposal to the INI. Proposals are reviewed by up to eight referees. In forming their judgements, the SSC considers these reports in the context of the quality of the research proposed, its timeliness, the opportunities it offers to bring together different branches of mathematics and/ or application areas, demand from and value to the UK community, and the potential impact which the special environment of the INI can engender. The SSC also takes account of activities at other Institutes world-wide. Those proposals that are approved by the SSC are assigned a time slot up to three years ahead. The organisers, who usually include some or all of the proposers, work with INI staff to invite participants and to identify whatever special requirements the programme may have identified. INI staff help with all practical aspects, and their commitment is hugely appreciated by visitors. The collaborations established between UK scientists and with those from elsewhere often continue and bear fruit over a long period, a major dividend of INI programmes. Wherever appropriate, this will be fostered by continuing the recent development of following up previous programmes through short workshops etc. This is a well-established format, which has been exceptionally successful in the 69 programmes run to date: the interdisciplinary breadth of programmes is unique, and their quality and the unrivalled INI environment attract world-leading experts (including 25 Fields medallists and 8 Nobel Prize-winners). But the INI is not complacent, and a number of changes will be instigated to enhance the quality and value of programmes to the community and end-users:- The engagement with the National Advisory Board and the network of Correspondents will be significantly strengthened to ensure that they have the fullest opportunity to shape the activities of the INI so that it is responsive to their interests;- Drawing on their inputs, the Director and staff will enhance the support for the SSC, so that it can increasingly stimulate the development of future programmes, particularly where there may be simply no alternative way to bring apparently disparate fields fruitfully together.- Access will be widened by ensuring that the IT facilities are state-of-practice and that web material is enhanced. - The Director and staff will also develop a strategy for more effectively involving industry and professional interests in the activities of the INI, so that they can influence and benefit more directly from its activities.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2008-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>9733806</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Microsoft Research</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Global</gtr:country><gtr:description>Challenges in Dynamic Imaging Data</gtr:description><gtr:id>29037E6C-8616-4537-8AE8-D9BAA2C1212B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The workshop brought together industrial and academic experts from a diverse set of backgrounds in mathematics, computer science and information engineering including:

Participants are invited to share their latest engineering problems and proposed solutions so as to promote the creation and exchange of ideas and the identification of new trends and required developments.

The 1st UK workshop on Optimisation in Space Engineering (OSE) was held on 5-6 November 2013 in Birmingham with one of the outputs being the formation of a national working group. This event was jointly organised by the Turing Gateway to Mathematics (TGM), the European Space Agency (ESA) and the University of Southampton, and it was hosted by the University of Birmingham. In this first meeting, participants shared their latest engineering problems and proposed solutions so as to promote the creation and exchange of ideas and the identification of new trends and required developments. 

The 2nd OSE workshop held in Cambridge on 19- 20 March 2014 took forward outputs generated from the first workshop, such as identified challenges and issues. The event sought to address these through a series of talks, discussion and break-out group type activities. Feedback indicated the value of engagement between academia and industry, especially at an early stage of a problem formation. Additionally, a number of example space engineering optimisation problems were investigated and the solutions compared and contrasted to gain understanding of the efficiency of the various techniques.

The 3rd workshop took place at the University of Strathclyde on 17-18 September 2015 and helped to widen the sphere of expertise to Europe. A space challenge competition was run as part of this event and an open discussion on this took place at the workshop. 
The challenges were chosen because of their relevance to actual space missions:

Representatives from the Government Operational Research Service attended each of the events and were able to identify challenges, share information and highlight outputs with colleagues that could lead to future interactions between mathematicians and policy makers in Government Departments and help channel resources where there is most potential impact.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Knowledge Exchange Community Meeting 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0DD1E250-A5EB-43A8-9DEF-4ED41AF2433E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The TGM was represented and gave a presentation at this meeting hosted by the ICMS in Edinburgh as a forum for discussion on knowledge exchange for those from the maths community.

TGM Mission Statement
The Turing Gateway to Mathematics acts as a channel for the flow of knowledge and ideas between the mathematical sciences and the users of mathematics. It does this by facilitating interactions and activities such as programmes of work, events, projects, education and training in areas where maths skills are needed. Acting as a gateway between academic mathematicians and industry, government, and other disciplines, it helps to widen access to mathematics generally and shorten pathways to impacts. 

Background
In March 2013, the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences launched the Turing Gateway to Mathematics. The TGM is an impact initiative of the INI and aims to stimulate the interchange of knowledge and ideas between academics of different disciplines and users of modern mathematics. Named after Alan Turing because of his exceptionally wide influence across a very broad front, the Gateway is a channel for collaboration and cooperation between academia and industry. It will help to shorten pathways to impact and increase access to modern mathematical methods for other industrial and academic areas.

Since the TGM was established, it has consolidated its presence, delivering a range of activities across a number of different themes and sectors including financial risk, space and security sectors, Big Data and public policy.

In addition to running the visitor research programmes, the Isaac Newton Institute brings academic researchers in the mathematical sciences together with industrial, commercial and government organisations and individuals through activities such as the Open for Business events. The success of these events (see http://www.newton.ac.uk/ofb/ ) together with follow-up activity associated with the Institute's research programmes is a key motivation for the Turing Gateway to Mathematics initiative.

The TGM continues to nurture and expand engagement, and strategic relationships with the public sector, academia and industry are ongoing. This has been achieved by facilitating interactions and activities such as programmes of work, consultations, workshops, research and training programmes, as well as less formal, small working groups in which academics and business personnel work together. This approach enables engagement between individuals and organisations who were not previously working together and helps to achieve greater synergy across activity and more creative and imaginative approaches. This flexibility helps address targeted activity, without being proscriptive.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2008</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>A951B41E-E7AE-47F7-8D81-F5F0E11D5939</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Pharmaceuticals and Medical Biotechnology,Security and Diplomacy,Transport,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The Isaac Newton Institute is internationally acclaimed as a world-leading visitor research institute, running Programmes of the highest quality in the mathematical sciences and its applications.
