The research will construct a bridgehead between transitional justice and the sociology of the legal professions. It will also draw upon a range of interdisciplinary literature, including comparative legal studies, historical institutionalism and social movement theory.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aims of the project are:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to develop a comparative perspective on the sociology of lawyering exploring lawyers as actors within and beyond the courtroom; to examine the intersection between lawyers and other key civil society, political and legal actors in social movements&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to explore the contribution of lawyers in shaping local and international understandings of the ?rule of law?&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to interrogate the extent to which transitional contexts may be viewed as ?exceptional? from the experiences of settled democracies&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to chart the relevance (or not) of key themes on the relationship between law, lawyers and political and social change in such contexts, in particular legal culture, colonial and post-colonial lawyering and legal pluralism. &lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The project will draw from comparative legal methods and socio-legal traditions of empirical fieldwork in conducting 120 semi-structured interviews across the six field sites.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;br />&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM THIS RESEARCH?

Beyond enhancing academia in a range of disciplines, this project will impact positively on non-academic users in the case study jurisdictions. These users will include local legal professionals and their collectives (Bar Councils, Law Societies and equivalent), as well as government departments that work closely with legal professionals or seek to address ongoing or past violence, such as justice departments, police services, human rights commissions and other oversight bodies. Furthermore, this project will benefit civil society activists, including organisations in which lawyers are active, as well as groups that seek to use legal tools to address past crimes.

Internationally, this project will enhance the work of actors who support rule of law and transitional justice projects through funding, training programmes for legal professionals or secondment of experts. Policymakers and donors that engage in this work include the United Nations, the European Union, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Organisation of American States, the African Union, the British Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the US State Department and Agency for International Development. In addition, the project intends to benefit international legal collectives, such as the International Bar Association, and national legal collectives that work overseas to promote the rule of law in transitional states, such as the American Bar Association and the International Committee of the English Bar Council. It will also engage with the work of transnational civil society actors, such as the International Center for Transitional Justice, the International Commission of Jurists, Avocats Sans Fronti&amp;egrave;res, Advocates for Human Rights, Lawyers for Human Rights, Human Rights Lawyers Association and Human Rights First, which work with lawyers to promote transitional justice around the world.

Finally, he project will contribute to the research skills and experience of the project team.

HOW WILL THEY BENEFIT FROM THE RESEARCH?

In the case study jurisdictions, users will benefit from the project during the investigation and dissemination phases in several ways. For example, the project team will develop a range of accessible and constructive outputs for local actors, which will be translated where appropriate and freely disseminated. These outputs will aim to improve the capacity and efficiency of local legal professional associations and civil society organisations through highlighting applicable international standards, networks and funding sources. The project and its outputs will also enhance the capacity of local actors to protect rights, develop creative legal arguments, establish civil society groups or campaign for legal and institutional reforms.

Internationally, the project will use targeted briefing papers, academic and policy outputs and an international conference to engage with policymakers, donors and transnational civil society actors. This research will benefit these actors by broadening their awareness of the productive and restrictive roles that lawyers play in transitions. This research will enhance the efficiency of international donor programmes seeking to promote the rule of law and transitional justice by highlighting potential obstacles. Furthermore, by facilitating knowledgeable and effective cooperation amongst local and global actors, this project will contribute to evidence-based policymaking by international actors and raise international awareness of the need to support lawyers and professional associations that seek to enforce human rights standards.

Finally, the research team will develop their research skills through the experience of conducting documentary analysis and qualitative research. In addition, they will participate in relevant training programmes offered by the universities.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-11-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>490193</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Physicians for Human Rights</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United States of America</gtr:country><gtr:description>Physicians for Human Rights and Coiste na nIarchimi</gtr:description><gtr:id>2D9DBE65-8A22-4D3C-A1F9-BA1780AC0FAE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference scheduled to take place at Queen's University Belfast in May 2016.

Dr Mallinder took this opportunity to offer some preliminary findings from our recent field research in Cambodia. The precarious nature of the rule of law in contemporary Cambodia was assessed in terms of impunity, freedom of expression, judicial independence, judicial capacity and public confidence in the legal system. Our findings from Cambodia were then mapped onto the prevailing theoretical literature on transitional justice and cause lawyering. Dr Mallinder concluded by considering the potential that human rights holds as a catalyst for future political transformation. In a wide-ranging and thought-provoking paper Professor McEvoy then explored the complex relationship between lawyers and professionalism in situations of conflict and transition.

The conference explored the role of civil society in developing and implementing transitional justice processes, particularly in the context of ongoing conflicts. Civil society has a vital, though often under-acknowledged, role in developing transitional justice mechanisms, institutions and concepts. Over the past three decades civil society organizations have set the agenda for transitional justice policies, promoted, supported and developed mechanisms and interventions, acted as advocates and critics of local and international institutions, and helped in developing the theoretical, legal and conceptual framework of transitional justice. From local grassroots organizations like the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Argentina to international networks like the Coalition for the ICC, civil society organizations have been central in struggles for justice, truth and accountability across various contexts, while other civil society groups have been key actors in efforts of reconciliation, inter-community dialogue and conflict-transformation. One of the conference's main achievements was to facilitate local learning and discussion in relation to civil society and transitional justice in the Israeli-Palestinian context. McEvoy and Mallinders contributions were central to this.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lawyersconflictandtransition.org/lawyering-in-limited-democracies</gtr:url><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Annual Conference of Socio-Legal Studies Association, Specialist Stream, University of Lancaster</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>3EDC9A48-5D56-464C-A07B-459BB31AD135</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to convene specialist stream on Transitions from Conflict: the Role and Agency of Lawyers at the annual Socio-Legal Studies Association conference in Lancaster.

Oxford Transitional Justice Research (OTJR) is an inter-disciplinary network of more than 100 Oxford staff and students working broadly on issues of transition in societies recovering from mass conflict and/or repressive rule. OTJR is dedicated to producing high-quality scholarship that connects intimately to practical and policy questions in transitional justice, focusing on the following themes: Prosecutions, Truth Commissions, Local and traditional practices, Compensation and reparations, Theoretical and philosophical debates in transitional justice, Institutional reform and Archives of tribunal and other transitional justice materials. The OTJR seminar programme is held weekly and reflects these aims. This seminar was a critically important opportunity to disseminate information about the Lawyers, Conflict and Transition project and to develop contacts for future research collaborations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Other academic audiences (collaborators, peers etc.)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://lawyersconflictandtransition.org/professor-mcevoy-discusses-lawyers-causes-and-political-violence-at-university-of-oxford/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>TV interview</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>44673129-C008-4263-B57E-ADFB162046EC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The interview was broadcast several times on the NVTV television channel and it continues to be available on their website.

Nurturing and developing good working relations with a wide range of legal, human rights and civil society organisations has been central to the success of the fieldwork for this project. As part of our ethical commitment to 'put something back' into the societies and organisations being scrutinised we pledged to produce two accessible policy documents for each of the six jurisdictions (translated into local languages). This was greatly valued by the participants in the research.

For example, a South African interviewee stated:
'For me that's wonderful. I use international researchers instrumentally, you knowwhen I get involved in this kind of thingI use you for sub-south linkages, so I'm going to use you to, you know, to know more about Palestine, Chile and those other placesbecause I've got this theme that the south must, you know, intake much more and do things together much, much more - but we don't have the resources, you know. So if you go to Palestine and, you know, you create those linkages - for me, it's also selfish from that perspective, to say 'wow these guys - I can use them for my sub south vision, you know'. So if, you know, if you're all South African I'm not very interested, but if they're comparative studies I'm much more interestedbut that's wonderful, this offer [to produce two reports].'

Speaking to the benefits of one of our reports for international donors a Cambodian lawyer stated that it will -
'help to document the real state of affairs in Cambodia and hopefully deepen the understanding of foreign donors working in Cambodia. This information will support better decision making on how to use their grants.'


Impact on International Actors

In addition to these 'local' policy papers we also committed to preparing policy briefings for key international organisations. One of these focuses on the role of international bar associations and the second explores the prospect of improving the effectiveness of international lawyers. Reflecting on the latter, a US-based attorney and founder of the rule of law and legal empowerment network 'Reinventing the Rules' contacted us to say that she had found our recently published paper on SSRN. She added:

'This is one of the best and most important reports I've read all year and I will be highlighting it on our website in the coming weeks. I started asking attorneys and organizations last year whether they were providing any training on cross-cultural skills prior to them working on a rule of law or legal empowerment program and wasn't able to find anyone who had. I just wanted to drop you both a quick note and thank you for writing on this very important topic. I am looking forward to bringing more attention to your timely work on this!'

As part of our dissemination strategy we email all new reports directly to the relevant cohort of individual interviewees, and to our extensive network of international contacts including scholars, policymakers, legal professionals, donors and civil society actors. Each recipient is encouraged to forward the report to their colleagues and associates and to publicise it on their networks. All of our project updates and findings are available on our bespoke website. In the course of the last 18 months (Sept 2014 - Feb 2016) this website has registered over 6000 unique visits. In addition to our own direct dissemination there have been more than 350 independent downloads of our local and international policy reports.


Political Prisoners and the Medical Profession

In the course of our fieldwork in Israel a number of interviewees expressed particular interest in the PI's previous research on politically motivated prisoners. The NGO Physicians for Human Rights specifically asked if it might be possible to facilitate collaboration between them and ex-prisoner organisations in Northern Ireland. Drawing on his extensive contacts in the field the PI subsequently engaged an Israeli scholar based at the Centre for Conflict Transformation and Social Change at Queen's University Belfast to assist with the development of this collaboration. This resulted in an unanticipated but highly significant impact outcome for this project. A conference is now scheduled to take place at QUB in May 2016. It will bring together the relevant Israeli and Northern Ireland NGOs and civil society actors to debate the 'real-world' challenges of applying medical and legal ethics in a prison context.


Dealing with the Past in Northern Ireland

This project emerged from a range of practical and scholarly activities previously undertaken by the applicants, concerning the themes of amnesties and transitional justice (AH/J013897/1 'Amnesties, Prosecution and the Public Interest in the Northern Ireland Transition' and AH/E008984/1 'Beyond Legalism: Amnesties, Transition and Conflict Transformation'). It provided the platform to further develop and invigorate work on these broad themes by examining the role of lawyers in a range of carefully chosen international contexts.

A more direct opportunity to apply the emerging lessons and findings to local policymaking and thus to have a significant societal impact arose in December 2014 as a result of the signing of the Stormont House Agreement. The PI secured follow-on funding to examine in detail the legislative framework for the implementation of the past-related elements of that Agreement.

Three members of the 'Lawyers, Conflict and Transition' team - together with representatives of the main Human Rights organisation in Northern Ireland - were directly engaged in this work. It resulted in the publication in September 2015 of a 'Model Bill' - an indicative statute that set out in detail how the Agreement might be implement in a way that is fair, transparent and human-rights compliant. In drafting this legislation the team drew directly on experiences and lessons documented in the course of our fieldwork for the 'Lawyers' project. For example, our lobbying efforts in the local sphere were also directly influenced by documentation of the strategic litigation strategies employed in the various international case studies.

This work on the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement resulted in two high-profile conferences in Belfast in 2015. Each was attended by: senior negotiators representing the Northern Ireland Office, the Irish Government and the main political parties in Northern Ireland; representatives of the key victims' NGOs; members of the local Gender Principles group; and a wide cross-section of academics, journalists and civil society actors.

The specific impacts are detailed under the appropriate headings. For example, Professor Mallinder was subsequently invited to deliver the annual Human Rights Day lecture in Belfast and to discuss the broader societal impact of this work in an interview for a local television station and Professor McEvoy was invited to address a committee hearing of the US Congress on the ongoing challenge of dealing with the past in Northern Ireland. Together with colleagues from RightsWatch UK and Amnesty International the 'Model Bill' drafting team also engaged in an intensive round of lobbying including numerous direct meetings with senior negotiators at the NIO, the NI Department of Justice, the Irish government and various political representatives. A roundtable was also held at Westminster to brief Labour, Conservative and Northern Ireland MPs on the key issues and to discuss future lobbying tactics.

At time of writing the 'Model Bill' drafting team is working closely with a range of victims' and legacy practitioner organisations to find a way out of the current impasse concerning the competing interests of 'the right to truth' and national security.


Impact on Legal Academics and Practitioners Beyond Case Study Sites

The team has exceeded its targets in terms of dissemination of findings at national and international conferences (as the project gathered pace and momentum, invitations to speak at conferences and seminars naturally increased). These exchanges with other academics and legal practitioners provided the foundation for jointly published academic papers and follow-on funding. They also inspired more junior academics to develop related projects. For example, at an early stage in the development of this project a group of postgraduate students at Queen's University Belfast were inspired to run a one-day international conference examining the synergy and cross-learning between the experience of 'lawyers in times of conflict' and dealing with the legacy of violence.</gtr:description><gtr:id>A7AA3073-D43C-47F1-8A55-1ABD73E61383</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>SIGNIFICANT NEW KNOWLEDGE GENERATED

The core component of our field research was qualitative interviews with more than 120 lawyers, judges, human rights activists and legal academics across the six jurisdictions. This complex dataset (in excess of 1.25 million words) was coded and analysed using NVivo software according to 27 carefully selected 'parent' themes and more than 250 'child' nodes. It is not possible in the space permitted to identify all of the areas in which new knowledge was generated but we highlight below some indicative examples.

NEW RESEARCH QUESTIONS OPENED UP
This international comparative study set out to answer new research questions concerning how conflict and transition shape the intersections between lawyers and other civil society, political and legal actors; the role of lawyers in shaping local and international understandings of the 'rule of law' in unsettled transitional periods; the extent to which transitional contexts may be viewed as 'exceptional' from the experiences of settled democracies; and the relevance (or not) of established themes on the relationship between law, lawyers and political and social change (such as legal culture, colonial and post-colonial lawyering and legal pluralism). 

Taken together these research questions delineated a new comparative sociology of lawyering perspective which captures in unprecedented detail the role and agency of lawyers in conflict and transition - both within and beyond the courtroom. In addition to these broad themes outlined in the original proposal, a number of important additional new research questions emerged during the project. 

1. Perceptions
The project explored in great detail the genuinely heroic struggles of some cause-lawyers as well as the effects, particularly in South Africa, of a tendency to overly eulogise 'struggle' or 'cause' lawyers.

2. Ethics
In contexts where the professional ethics upheld by Bar Associations were inevitably skewed toward supporting authoritarian or repressive regimes, we discovered novel and innovative ways in which cause lawyers developed their own ethical base and 'moral community' of like-minded lawyers in managing their relations with politically motivated clients. 

3. Cause Lawyering Within the State
In situations of transition we have been particularly struck by the ability of individual lawyers to adapt to radically different political contexts, sometimes making the transition from working in opposition to the state to serving within a new political dispensation - in effect becoming cause-lawyers within the state. 

4. Resistance
Instructive debates on strategies of legal resistance by lawyers centred on the concepts of boycott and performance i.e. in what context was it appropriate for lawyers to withdraw their services from unjust or unfair legal proceedings or to use courts primarily as sites of symbolic resistance. In addition, the project explored strategies where lawyers saw themselves as politically self-conscious archivists in contexts such as Chile (under the Pinochet regime) lodging habeus corpus applications to deliberate create paper trails that their disappeared client had actually existed.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>As part of our ethical commitment to give 'something back' to our international research participants we pledged to produce two user-friendly reports for each jurisdiction under scrutiny. The themes for these were suggested by interviewees. In total, we produced 12 such reports for local users. These were translated into Arabic, Hebrew, Spanish and Khmer as appropriate. Feedback from participants was unanimously positive. 

We also undertook to produce and deliver three briefing papers targeted at international users such as the UN, the International Bar Association, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and others. Again these were very well received.

At our final conference in Belfast, it became apparent that the themes we explored in an international context had immediate relevance for local actors in Northern Ireland. For example, one attendee noted: &amp;quot;As a government lawyer here in NI part of my role includes dealing with the legacy of the past and the litigation of inquests relating to same. This conference was such a welcome opportunity to hear about the challenges of other lawyers in other jurisdictions. There were so many thought-provoking talks - every single speaker was fascinating.&amp;quot; As noted elsewhere on ResearchFish, Professors McEvoy and Mallinder and Dr Bryson have all been centrally involved in 'Dealing with the Past' work in Northern Ireland and have applied lessons learned in the course of this international research project to that task.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9248080-2C59-4013-9D58-2429EE30390B</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Education,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://lawyersconflictandtransition.org/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Advice to major EU-funded 'Accounts of the Conflict' project</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>F033255F-FC33-44CE-943D-43ED7B4CC470</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Dr Anna Bryson joined the Advisory Committee for the University of Ulster's 'Accounts of the Conflict' project.
