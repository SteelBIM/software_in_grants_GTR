Application</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>G1001518</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) suffer with joint pain and stiffness, and joint damage which leads to a reduced ability to carry out everyday tasks. Although these are the most obvious features of the disease, the root cause of the disease lies within the human immune system. At the moment we don?t fully understand the immune abnormalities that lead to RA but, if we did, this should help us to manage the disease better. It would become easier to make a diagnosis, as well as to determine whether a patient?s RA is likely to damage their joints in the future. Perhaps most importantly it would help us to design better drugs to combat the disease, and to better use the drugs that already exist. Something that we would really like to be able to do is to decide the most appropriate drug for each patient and a better understanding of the immune abnormalities would also help here.
Therefore our plans are to study, in detail, the immune system of patients with RA. This will involve taking blood from patients and running a panel of advanced laboratory tests on their white blood cells. We will compare the results we obtain with the immune changes in healthy individuals responding to a vaccine ? expecting some to be the same and some to be different. Our work is in three phases and, during the phases, we plan to slowly ?home in? on simple laboratory tests that will allow us to measure what is happening to the immune system in patients with RA. An exciting aspect of the work is that what is relevant to RA may also relate to other diseases (diabetes, multiple sclerosis, asthma) and to patients with an organ transplant. Therefore our results could have wide-ranging influence beyond improving the care of patients with RA</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Current management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is based upon measurement of inflammation and tissue damage. However these are downstream consequences of immune dysregulation, and sub-optimal guides for managing patients and designing disease-modifying drugs. Our aim is to identify the key immune abnormalities that define RA and to develop an immunological toolkit: a set of functional and flow cytometry-based assays to study and monitor the dysfunctional immune system. A UK-wide collaboration of academic and industrial scientists will develop the toolkit, using regular discussions and workshops. Although current theory suggests that key immune abnormalities in RA should reside within T- or B- lymphocytes, lessons from other diseases suggest a discovery approach to be most appropriate, encompassing deep immunophenotyping of major peripheral blood immune and inflammatory cell subsets. Therefore in phase I purified CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, B-cells, monocytes, NK cells and neutrophils will undergo: multiparameter flow cytometry for cell surface phenotype, intracellular cytokine and lineage transcription factor expression, and signalling pathways; transcriptional analysis using Affymetrix U219 microarrays; and small RNA sequencing. A well-defined subset (n=30) will subsequently undergo ultra-deep RNA sequencing, providing a complete picture of the RA transcriptome. We will study three sets of individuals: 30 healthy controls during an evolving vaccination response; 200 established RA patients, stratified for disease activity and disease duration; and 30 RA patients receiving abatacept (costimulation blockade). Hypothesis-generating phase I will provide a detailed signature of cells and pathways that characterise the RA immune system, and inform the design of customised, low-density array(s) (LDA), alongside the initial development of relevant in vitro immune function assays. In phase II these will be applied to 100 patients with recent onset inflammatory arthritis, sampled longitudinally, alongside a refined panel of flow cytometry protocols. Signals that are consistent between phases I and II will lead to further refinement of the in vitro assays ready for phase III, which encompasses proof-of-concept studies with novel therapeutic compounds, provided by industrial partners. Here the final immune toolkit will be ?road tested?, providing a secondary outcome measure that predicts conventional efficacy parameters. Success in this challenging programme will provide a novel portfolio of immune function assays, potentially applicable to RA but also other immunopathologies. Their widespread adoption and application across diseases will reinforce the successful image of UK translational immunological research.

multiple industry partners</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The overarching mission of the MATURA Consortium is to improve patient care in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>recruitment to the STRAP trial

multiple industry partners</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The overarching mission of the MATURA Consortium is to improve patient care in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>recruitment to the STRAP trial

multiple industry partners</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The overarching mission of the MATURA Consortium is to improve patient care in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>recruitment to the STRAP trial

multiple industry partners</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The overarching mission of the MATURA Consortium is to improve patient care in
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by rationalising therapy decisions through the use of a stratified
medicines approach.
Background: RA provides the ideal setting for the introduction of a stratified medicine
approach because, first, the treatment is standardised in England through National Institute
of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance such that methotrexate (MTX) is the first
choice disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD); patients who fail to respond to MTX
and at least one other DMARD are eligible for biologic TNF pathway blocking drugs (anti-
TNFs) or, more recently IL6 pathway blocking drugs, tocilizumab (TOC), and those who fail
to respond to anti-TNF can then be switched to the biologic B-cell depleting therapy,
rituximab (RTX). Second, it is well established that there is a significant non - response rate
to each drug (MTX (45% by 2 years), anti-TNF (25% by 6 months) and RTX (40% by 6
months). Third, the biologic drugs (anti-TNF, TOC and RTX) are expensive and all 4 drugs
are associated with serious adverse events; hence, identifying those patients least likely to
respond would improve the cost-benefit analysis. Finally, introduction of early, effective
therapy has consistently been shown to improve long-term outcomes including joint
damage, disability and employment.
Aim: To identify treatment response predictors which will allow the allocation of patients to
strata defined by the therapy they are most likely to respond to, early in the disease
process.
Methods: Two parallel workstrands (WS) will investigate synovial tissue (WS.1) and
peripheral blood (WS.2) to identify biomarkers of response. Thus, in WS.1 we shall search
for tissue-driven biomarkers and blood correlates in the largest synovial tissue biobank of
this type (2 time points 0 &amp;amp; 6 months biopsy) in the world &amp;amp; clinical datasets (over 200
patients immediately available). In addition, in a prospective randomised clinical trial
(adaptive design) we will test the hypothesis that discrete cellular and molecular signatures
in the synovial tissue (&amp;quot;pathotypes&amp;quot;) will enrich for response to existing biologic therapies. In
WS.2, we will take advantage of the large observational cohorts of patient samples either
already collected or which could be collected for minimal cost to undertake a comprehensive
analysis to identify genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic or, more likely, a
combination of these factors that will reliably identify responders/non-responders to each of
the drugs. These collections include biological samples from over 3,000 anti-TNF-, 1,500
MTX-, 1,200 RTX- and 200 TOC-treated subjects. The two WSs are fully integrated through
&amp;quot;multi-omic&amp;quot; approaches that constitute cross-cutting themes (CTs) that will converge in a
large analytical and modelling package driven by experts in Bioinformatics and Statistics and
allow preliminary health economic assessments of identified biomarkers. Finally, in
collaboration with our Industry partners we have drawn up plans to commercialize potential
diagnostics for patient benefit and wealth generation.
Outcome: By the end of the study, we will have identified biomarkers of response for four
of the most commonly used drugs in the treatment of RA. The study design allows a
comprehensive and cohesive assault on the problem of identifying, which patients will
respond best to which treatments in RA and has the potential for enormous clinical and
economic impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>recruitment to the STRAP trial

He discussed how precisely can diseases be treated in a way that is specific to the individual patient. He gave an in depth analysis of research in Rheumatology and the fact that there are 8 million people affected by the disease. Despite the complexity of the subject, Professor Bruce managed to make it accessible to the layman.
Professor Bruce alos talked about how research in the UK is fundedm and gave a breakdown of the various research being done by Medical Research Council and the National Institute of Health Research. Whilst the NHS's total budget is over &amp;pound;100 billion, the share devoted to research is under 3%.
For most people, the most fascinating part of the evening was listening to Professor Bruce on the general theme of medication. He he talked about medicine being &amp;quot;partly art, partly science.&amp;quot; Most drugs prescribing is on a trial and error / best guess basis, using the likely benefit to the average person. He talked about &amp;quot;personalised medicine&amp;quot; which would target the medicine to the individual patient, and &amp;quot;stratified medicine&amp;quot; which groups patients into categories to assess which medicine to use, being intermediate between using data for the average person and data for the specific individual.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.conservativemuslimforum.com/news~events/news-&amp;-past-events/health-event-precision-medicine--an-achievable/287</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>BT-CURE Workshop - Stockholm 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>4CF7E26B-D130-4059-9919-631363FCF7CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>AuToDeCRA Lecture and RT-CURE IMI proposal</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RA-MAP project presentation as a Startified Medicine exemplar at the MRC-eMedLab Stratified Medicine Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E60B1F73-2F61-47D6-A100-A1FC134D9A4A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The RA-Map project was presented as a Stratified Medicine exemplar at the MRC-eMedLab Stratified Medicine workshop</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Precision Medicine UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9855483-3A8E-4195-B398-F0E76F85A64E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>NOCRI joined UK leaders in the research, development and commercialisation of precision medicine for a one-day event this week designed to encourage new partnerships and highlight new opportunities in the field.

The Precision Medicine UK: Collaboration Nation event at De Vere Holborn Bars, London, on 9 December was organised on behalf of the Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform by Innovate UK,, National Institute for Health Research, Cancer Research UK,Medical Research Council, Invest Northern Ireland, Health and Care Research Wales and the Knowledge Transfer Network, with the NIHR Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure (NOCRI) coordinating the NIHR's involvement. 

The day formed part of a programme to make the UK a world leader in precision medicine and provided real-world examples of the discovery and development of precision medicine solutions, through talks, panel discussions, workshops and exhibitions with the opportunity to arrange one-to-one partnering meetings.

Precision medicine is an emerging approach to the treatment and diagnosis of disease that takes into account variations in a patient's genes, environment and lifestyle. It aims to better target treatments to an individual's circumstances to improve outcomes for patients.

Representatives from across the NIHR were involved in the day and presented on a range of projects and funding programmes. Professor Bryan Williams of NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre joined the first panel of the day which highlighted UK investments in the invention and evaluation phase of research. Professor Williams' highlighted key NIHR's investments in this space and provided examples of exciting precision medicine projects from UCLH BRC. In addition, a number of NIHR precision medicine projects were presented during the disease area specific showcase sessions. This included Professor Costantino Pitzalis who presented the THERAPIST study on behalf of the NIHR Translational Research Partnership, Professor Simon Mead's who presented a project at NIHR Queen's Square Biomedical Research Unit on the &amp;quot;dementia chip&amp;quot; and Professor Tariq Sadiq's who presented on Capacity Building and Delivery of Precision Medicine in Sexual Health, through NIHR Funding. Mark Samuels, Managing Director of NOCRI, also chaired a discussion panel themed 'Enabling Collaboration', which highlighted the value of collaborative working between companies, academics, charities and patients.

The event saw the launch by the chief executive of Innovate UK, Dr Ruth McKernan, of a new map of the precision medicine landscape.

A whole range of organisations, including charities, health bodies and devolved administrations are coordinating their work under the umbrella of Innovate UK's Stratified Medicine Innovation Platform, with NOCRI representing the NIHR.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.uk-pgx-stratmed.co.uk/index.php/event-calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2015/12/09/213/73/-</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>RA-MAP data infrastructure was presented as an exemlar at the MRC Stratified Medicine Applicats Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A481AB68-CE3A-488B-8374-43E44EE0A9B8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>RA-Map data infrastructure was presented as an exemplar at the MRC Stratified Medicine applicants workshop</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2017</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Immunogenicity Research Forum 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>1271D5B5-E426-4CBE-9673-0B381D9EF565</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prospective collaborations</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>'Platform for Investigation' Event at Manchester Muserum of Science and Industry</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>AC60BFD7-0D4D-4AE6-81F8-537EF55EA4EF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Manchester researchers were involved in awareness-raising activities at the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry held in April 2015.

The discussion focused on the key issues and opportunities surrounding collaboration with the NHS, focusing particularly on 'open innovation' models of partnership. Professor Andrew Cope (PI of RA-MAP study) contributed by presenting the MRC/ABPI-funded RA-MAP consortium as an exemplar of open innovation in the NHS and model of academia-NHS-industry collaboration.

Delegates enjoyed four case presentations that highlighted the advantages of open collaboration models and also some of the barriers and frustration involved with these partnerships. Following a candid and constructive period of discussion, delegates highlighted four areas that they considered to be the most significant barriers to open innovation. These were: lack of metrics, poor incentivisation and reward for innovation, cultural conflicts between sectors and poor use of existing structures. Delegates then worked in groups to consider novel solutions to overcoming these barriers and facilitate open innovation partnerships with the NHS.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/policy/policy-projects/open-innovation-in-the-nhs/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>MRC Research Strategy Visit 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>00DF0892-E135-4937-8C90-839806361769</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Reviewed medical research at Newcastle highlighting achievements in experimental medicine and translational research and identifying improvement opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Supporters</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Inventory of Trials Study Workshop on Predictors of Remission Study</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>05A0EEB9-AB64-45C5-895A-6E5BCA09BA51</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop for the Predictors of Remission study was organised in Manchester by Prof Jane Worthington, Prof Deborah Symmons, Prof Ian Bruce and Ms Fiona Stirling. The workshop provided an opportunity to feed back information and analyses of the pooled clinical datasets from the 7 consortium member organisations. The meeting was successful, supported by approximately 20 participants contributing from these organisations (mixture of academic and industry partners).

The findings of the study are planned to be incorporated into a manuscript under preparation by Prof Deborah Symmons. This workshop also promoted further data to be produced in order to strengthen the powering of the results. In addition, Brian Tom (study statistician for the RA-MAP consortium) was invited to speak at PSI (Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry) conference in May 2015.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>EULAR 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D3FC9F28-A511-4711-8D17-58F9959263FD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Prospective collaboration with Pfizer</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Research Engagement Poster Campaign 2015</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an open day or visit at my research institution</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>52B1D181-21BF-41C0-BCE5-B1264CB0ED95</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Poster campaign describing research in lay terms for public and patients audience.

[Updates from March 2016]
We are sharing curated public data in the database with the MRC-MATURA, MRC-PSORT and IMI-etriks projects
Knowledge sharing and troubleshooting between these projects has enabled more rapid data curation and data infrastructure development for the project. We have also provided advice and troubleshooting on TranSMART configuration to the MRC-CHART (Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis) and MRC-Masterplan (SLE) consortia 

[Updates from March 2017]
As a complex, highly curated dataset, the RA-Map TranSMART is serving as an exemplar for development of TranSMART for the the MRC-MATURA, MRC-PSORT and MRC-MASTERPLANS projects.
