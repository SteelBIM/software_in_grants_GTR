It is relatively simple, having about 4000 genes which reside on a single circular DNA molecule or chromosome. Extra genes, which may give the bacterium the ability to cause disease or to be resistant to antibiotics, are often found on smaller DNA molecules known as plasmids. As the bacterium grows and divides these plasmids are copied and are distributed to new bacterial cells. Occasionally the plasmids are damaged and fuse together in pairs known as dimers. These dimers interfere with the distribution of plasmids to daughter cells when the bacterium divides and so cause loss of the plasmid from its bacterial host. To avoid plasmid loss it is important that the damage is repaired. The main repair process involves cutting the dimers into two (by a process known as site-specific recombination), thus restoring them to their original form. This is not, however, the whole story. The plasmid also activates a mechanism which prevents the bacterial cell from dividing while plasmid repair is taking place. This type of response to DNA damage called a 'checkpoint' and although it is well-known in more complex organisms, such as fruit flies or humans, is less common in bacteria. We are interested in exactly how the plasmid stops its bacterial host dividing. We have known for some time that the mechanism involves the production of a small RNA molecule called Rcd but we have not known exactly what Rcd does. Recently we discovered that Rcd binds to an enzyme in the bacterial cell and stimulates it to produce a small organic molecule called indole. We have shown that it is indole which is responsible for stopping the division of the bacterial cell. In this project we propose to look in detail at exactly how Rcd causes the enzyme to make indole and try to understand, at a molecular level, how indole stops E. coli dividing. Understanding this process is important not only because it illustrates an important way in which bacterial and plasmids deal with DNA damage, but also because developing drugs which interfere with this process could potentially provide a new antibiotics to fight bacterial infection.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>Multicopy plasmids of E. coli rely upon high copy number to ensure their distribution to daughter cells at division. Plasmid multimer formation depresses copy number and increases the probability of plasmid loss when cells divide. Although plasmid multimers form only infrequently, they out-replicate monomers and thus accumulate rapidly. Multimer formation triggers a DNA damage checkpont which blocks cell division until multimers have been converted to monomers by site-specific recombination. Multimer resolution is best understood for the E. coli plasmid ColE1 which contains a recombination site, cer, at which multimer resolution is mediated by the XerCD recombinase. Division of cells containing plasmid multimers is blocked by the synthesis of a small regulatory transcript, Rcd. The transcript is encoded within cer and expressed from a promoter, Pcer, which is sensitive to the multimeric state of the plasmid. We have recently shown that Rcd binds to tryptophanase, increasing its affinity for tryptophan and stimulating indole production. Preliminary work in the applicant's laboratory has shown that indole blocks E. coli cell division but the mechanism remains unknown. This application is focussed on two aspects of the Rcd checkpoint. A genetic analysis of the interaction between Rcd and tryptophanase will examine tryptophanase mutants which are no longer activated by Rcd. These will enable us to define the transcript binding domain. Tryptophanase mutants which behave as if they are permanently stimulated by Rcd will give us clues about the mechanism by which the transcript activates the enzyme. We will also investigate in detail the effect of indole on the cell biology of E. coli, in particular distinguishing between a specific block of cell division and a co-ordinated cell cycle arrest. Once the precise nature of the 'indole block' has been established we will begin to unravel the molecular mechanism of indole action by identifying its molecular target.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2011-04-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2007-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>319484</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Department of Physics</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Cavendish Laboratory</gtr:department><gtr:description>Physics-Biology collaboration</gtr:description><gtr:id>91210798-8DBB-48D9-8DAF-8EDC76D50CCC</gtr:id><gtr:piContribution>An active collaboration has been developed between the Summers group at Cambridge University Department of Genetics and the Keyser group at the Cambridge University Cavendish Physics Laboratory.
