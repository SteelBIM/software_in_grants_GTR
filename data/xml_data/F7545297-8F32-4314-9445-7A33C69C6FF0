grass crops. Such a system, using a spray boom covering a 10x.5m area of ground, could feasibly run at upwards of 1m/s,
allowing precision spraying of weeds at between 1 and 2 hectares/hr.

The consortium is comprised of three partners; (1) Centre for Machine Vision (CMV), a leading research centre in 3D
machine vision, with past success in the agri-tech field, (2) Aralia Systems Ltd (AS), an international security company with
a wide R&amp;amp;D portfolio in data-mining and complex feature analysis on videos, (3) Soil Essentials Ltd (SE), a leading
precision agriculture company specialising in GPS machinery guidance, implement control, cloud based decision support
systems and emerging grassland agronomy technologies.

The primary focus will be to detect weeds in grass such as dock and ragwort using novel 3D machine vision techniques. Initially the
project will use off-the-shelf machinery to spray an area of roughly 50x50cm around each weed, activating the relevant
nozzles on the boom with an estimated aimed decrease in herbicide use of around 75%.The project will then look to
determine the limits of precision by refining the boom itself, allowing nozzles to move linearly across the boom as on an
inkjet printer, or in rotation using servo motors. Using this approach, we aim to provide potential reductions in herbicide use
in excess of 90%.

The role of the CMV team will be to realise novel 3D imaging hardware and software for detecting the weeds in the grass
while moving on a tractor. We also aim to recognise the weed species. This data will be used to both direct the automated
weeding system in real-time (developed by SE) and to create a detailed weed data map (developed by AS) of the entire
field.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The aim of the project is to develop a novel spray apparatus for precision application of herbicides to broad-leaf weeds in

offering increased productivity of grass swards. End-user farmers are expected to see substantial reductions in herbicide 
use in excess of 90%.

There are also wider environmental and social benefits. Environmental benefits will accrue from a more efficient, precision
application of herbicides and increased pasture yield. Precision application will reduce the environmental impact and
economic losses from the industry and help to improve feed conversion efficiency from pasture, boosting food security.
Considerable environmental benefits will accrue from a more efficient, precision application of herbicides. Benefits include,
reduced environmental contamination, eg of water sources, ability to treat larger grassland areas, increasing yields
reducing the need for purchasing feed, ability to spray in environmentally sensitive areas where spraying is currently not
possible, reduction of herbicide costs and clover damage. Better management of pasture will allow longer herd life will
reduce the environmental impact and economic losses from the industry and help to improve feed conversion efficiency in
beef and milk production, boosting food security. Benefits will accrue beyond the project as improvements in pasture and
its management grow. The economic and environmental potential of grassland weed control is very high due to the
extensive area grassland covers, the economic loss of untreated weeds and the high cost (both economic and
environmental) of blanket application of herbicide.

Economic Impacts - The development of the technology, data handling, benchmarking systems and pasture weed control
and health monitoring will increase the SME partners' profile in R&amp;amp;D, leading to further opportunities and developments within the
value chain. An increased turnover and profitability following the project will help to increase employment and job security.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2016-09-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>107053</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Techniques for identifying weeds in grass.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Likely to be exploited by the commercial partners</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>860D5FBC-4643-452B-A453-0696CB78C03F</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Agriculture, Food and Drink</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/P005039/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>13975896-2E87-4DAA-99BC-E8D86B00B146</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant &amp; crop science</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>8C69AA8D-0736-45EE-BA77-D6E60B4C9893</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Plant organisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
