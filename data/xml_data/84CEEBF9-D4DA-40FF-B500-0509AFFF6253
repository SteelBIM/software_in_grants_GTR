Close at hand, we need to understand and measure plasmas, fields and particles understand the dynamic Sun and its interaction with the heliosphere. In this proposal we focus on several key unsolved problems in solar physics that are also prototypes for a wider and deeper understanding of cosmic plasmas as a whole. Our top-level questions are: how do high-energy radiating particles behave in solar flares and in interplanetary space? How are they accelerated, are they beamed and do they play a key role in flares and their terrestrial impact? How does the Sun store and release energy in its magnetised atmosphere, and what can we learn about this process by computer simulations and by studying the radiation that is emitted? 

The magnetic field is key to everything that happens in the Sun's atmosphere. Concentrated magnetic regions emerge through the Sun's surface and into its atmosphere. Here they interact with the pre-existing magnetic field and the result is intense bursts of energy known as flares, which accelerate sub-atomic particles (electrons and ions), cause heating to millions of degrees, and can also lead to expulsion of magnetised plasma into space, which can lead to damaging `space weather'. Flares have distinctive radiation signatures that are closely related to the structure of the magnetic field, and to the way that energy is transmitted along the magnetic field from the corona down to the solar surface and out into the distant heliosphere, and converted into other forms as it goes. By interpreting this radiation we can understand what is happening in a flare. More generally solar magnetic fields create eccentric and dynamic shapes in the solar atmosphere, for example swirling `tornado-like' structures in which the plasma, and perhaps the magnetic field supporting it, is rotating.

Our programme combines observational data with theoretical and numerical modelling to address all of these topics, and spans a wide range of astronomical and technical problems, from the modeling of the path of radiation in a plasma to high-energy particle acceleration; from electromagnetic waves to relativistic particle beams; from image processing to statistical analysis of weak signals, and from mathematical `pen-and-paper' calculations to advanced numerical simulations. We will bring all these skills to bear on questions at the heart of current efforts to better understand our nearest star. Some aspects of our work will also help us to assess the potential threat of eruptions on the Sun, which is a key element of space weather forecasting.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>All Co-Is on the grant are involved in trying to ensure that our STFC-funded research efforts are used to the wider benefit of society, through reaching out to cognate disciplines, engagement with policy-makers and industry, and an extremely active schools and public outreach programme. We are actively involved, and contribute to the agendas of, with several initiatives in space weather and sensors, both internal and external to Glasgow University. This includes an STFC-funded space weather network. We have received
University support for joint projects with the Schools of Engineering and Mathematics &amp;amp; Statistics, which has led to significant cross-disciplinary research, supported by a PhD student.

Our research, and the involvement that it brings us with high profile projects and missions, will benefit the public. As can be seen from our extensive list of outreach engagements we are extremely active in communicating our work through public events, tens of talk per year to science centres, schools and societies, and science-art projects. We dedicate particular effort to bringing our work to remote sites in Scotland. Plans are in place for several new initiatives, such as the 'Cetus' sky- and whale-watching observatory in Isle of Lewis, as well as continuing the programme of talks, observatory visits and observing nights etc which are co-ordinated by the group secretary and run by group members (note, we have an 'Outreach' website at: http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/outreach/index.php which acts as a single point of contact for all outreach requests). We strongly encourage the involvement of our RAs and particularly our PhD students in this activity as well, ensuring a lively and continued programme. 

Keeping at the forefront of our respective research areas ensures that we remain credible speakers for the public, as evidenced by many repeat invitations. We are also closely involved with schools activities, giving many talks, planetarium shows, and running projects school-specific projects. This activity is undertaken by staff and PhD students alike and is co-ordinated as above via our outreach website and group secretary.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2020-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3"><gtr:id>D7F4F462-0518-4784-908A-D12633C139B3</gtr:id><gtr:name>STFC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2017-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>712896</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">ST/P000533/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>CC54D2C6-621F-4715-96B2-C951ECBAF1C4</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar &amp; terrestrial physics</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>DAA4C99D-BD30-4A55-B416-7AFE780BB7B8</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>10</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar &amp; Solar-Terrestrial Phys</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>158FC7A6-6652-4271-9D78-11BEE91FADDD</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>90</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Solar Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
