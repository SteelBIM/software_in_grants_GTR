Interpreting the 1960s, historians have traditionally seen them as a pivotal era, associated with a cultural revolution in which family, sexual, gendered, racial and class relationships all changed as old conventions were discarded (Jonathon Green, 1998; Arthur Marwick, 1998). Yet the assumption on the part of both politicians and historians that the sixties were an era of radical change has been challenged by Dominic Sandbrook (2005), who argues that there were strong elements of continuity with post-1945 Britain and that the changes that did occur were slow, painful and often controversial. Instead of embracing radicalism and experimentation, much of British society remained conventional and conservative. I will aim to shed light on this debate by analysing the memories of cinemagoers. Not only was cinema in many respects representational, portraying the class, gendered, sexual and cultural changes of the time, it was also believed by many writers on film to have emblematic qualities, embodying a wide range of society's hopes, myths, fears and fantasies. Moreover, it was still a mass entertainment, bringing together people from varied social and cultural backgrounds. The analysis of memories of cinemagoing offers the possibility of contributing new perspectives on 1960s social and cultural history by engaging with memory and lived experience. 

The project's methodology will be based on the collection of individual memories of 1960s cinemagoing through questionnaires, individual interviews and focus group discussions. In the beginning, subjects will be self-selected: they will volunteer to complete a detailed questionnaire on the project website in the main because they have seen advertisements or letters announcing the project in a range of newspapers and periodicals (some may alternatively hear of the website because of the publicity surrounding its launch). Once the questionnaires have been completed and analysed, the project team will decide which respondents will also be invited to personal interviews or to become members of focus groups. Those decisions will be informed by the need to have a sample that is balanced in gender terms and as wide as possible in terms of age, social class, and ethnicity. In terms of scholarly output, the project will result in three conference papers, two scholarly articles, and a book.
In addition to the academic rationale for the project, a major priority will be the engagement of a wider public. This will be achieved for the most part through a programme of screening major 1960s films (e.g. Saturday Night and Sunday Morning, Victim, A Kind of Loving, Darling, Alfie) at 11 venues across the UK. 9 of these screenings will be followed by a discussion on the film and the 1960s themselves moderated by the Principal Investigator and Research Assistant. Two screenings in the final year of the project will be at larger venues and followed by a debate on the memory and legacy of the 1960s involving historians and film scholars. Moreover, given the enthusiasm of many people for the cinema, it is probable that the book based on the project will have a broader circulation than most scholarly books. For the same reason (considerable public interest in cinema and cinemagoing), it is possible that the project will give rise to radio and television documentaries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Cinema and cinemagoing interest many people outside the academic community. The idea for this project was born when I gave a lecture on films and filmgoing in the 1960s to alumni of University College London who had graduated in that decade. After the lecture was over, many of the audience approached me eager to share memories of their early filmgoing experiences. It occurred to me that many British people still have memories of cinema in the sixties and that, unless these memories are harvested, a whole major aspect of the history of that crucial decade may be lost. The project was always intended, however, as much more than simply an attempt to create historical source-materials. Since the research participants are themselves publics, many with a very interactive relationship through interviews and focus groups with the project team, the project by its very nature represents a form of public engagement. Awareness of the project, however, will extend far beyond those who are participants in the research.

A series of evening screenings of 'classic' 1960s films at local community cinemas and film societies, followed by discussions of the films and the memory of the 1960s themselves moderated by the Principal Investigator and the Research Assistant, will be organised at 8 venues. From my own experience of local film societies, these events - if well-publicised (the project team will assist) - would be enthusiastically received and attract quite large local audiences (50-80). Representatives of local newspapers will be invited to attend. This programme will be supplemented by three larger events. The first would be the launch of the project following a screening at UCL. The second and third would be screenings followed by debates including invited historians and film scholars on the legacy/memory of the 1960s. All these screenings will be advertised on the project and a number of history websites. With the help of the UCL Media Unit, the larger screenings/debates will be publicised through the media and both broadcast and print journalists invited to cover them. It is believed that, at these events, which are likely to be well-attended as a consequence of both many people's interest in cinema and the continuing importance of the sixties as a focus of interest and public discussion, debates may develop between those who remember the sixties through personal recollection and those for whom the sixties are a decade known only through history or the media. 

With the help of the UCL Media Unit, I will propose a Radio 4 programme on 1960s cinema and cinemagoing in Britain. I will also endeavour through my contacts in the media to persuade a television production company that the findings of the project would make a good subject for a historical documentary. 

It is believed that a significant number of people outside academia will benefit from the project, in part through having their recollections respected and recorded, in part through being encouraged to think about and place their own youthful film-going activities into social and cultural perspective, or - in the case of young viewers attending screenings and discussions - being encouraged to think about the character and legacy of the past.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>324849</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Former project Research Associate M.

It challenged, in some respects, the idea of 'swinging' Britain during the sixties. Although cinemas were certainly places where young couples went on dates and 'courting' of varying kinds took place, there were also limits to the behaviour tolerated by managers and torch-wielding usherettes. Our project also uncovered memories of sexual harassment in 60s cinemas, sometimes linked with a malfunctioning censorship system (young boys and girls often asked strangers to accompany them into 'A'-certificate peformances, with all the dangers this posed). Some films also stand out in people's memories, either because they were viewed at a particular juncture in their own lives/relationshps or they reflected a somewhat more liberal attitude to matters such as abortion and homosexuality than was embodied in the law (at least until 1967). The discussion after the paper amongst an inernational audience of film scholars was especially lively and fruitful.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Introducing the film and talking about the 'Cultural Memory and British Cinema-going of the 1960s' project at a screening of 'Tom Jones' at the Phoenix Art Cinema, Leicester, organised in collaboration with the University of the Third Age (12 August 2015)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8BBFB1B4-D63E-44E8-BC36-2FB9BF899A19</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A very pleasing discussion with many people eager to contribute (and compare) their own memories of cinema-going in Britain in the 1960s.

But hearing others talk I began to remember lots of things.' The same woman thanked the project for 'giving me back my memories.' Many others since then have said similar things - or provided feedback on these lines. Another participant in a project event wrote to us that 'The discussion triggered memories which had been buried beneath the surface. Such a delight to have those memories returned.' This participant commented that the event as a whole 'gave me insight into what others in other parts of Britain were experiencing at that time. I also realised how influential film was to the defining of my identity.' A woman from Exeter judged an event we arranged there as 'so very interesting. The group exchange was humorous and fun. A delightful but informative session with a social benefit to participants.' Another participant in the same event writes that it 'Came as a good reminder and I learned a lot from the audience.' From the feedback we have had from those who have taken part in project-sponsored events, it seems clear that the project itself has not only stimulated many people's memory of cinema-going in the '60s but has also prompted them to reflect on how going to the cinema, and the films they watched, had contributed to the formation of their own identity.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>4DAAA858-5A6B-4ED5-8603-DE5175794AF4</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>At the beginning of the project, little was known about what it was like to attend cinemas in 1960s Britain. Through the 900+ questionnaires we have collected and 70+ interviews conducted, we are tracing the different experience of those who went to cinemas belonging to the two major chains, independent cinemas (referred to affectionately if sometimes accurately as 'fleapits'), publicly-funded houses (the National Film Theatre and the three new Regional Film Theatres), and film clubs run by particular local communities and university students. We have uncovered evidence of cinemas used for other purposes than showing films (pop music concerts, for example). Respondents also shared with us memories of attending children's matinees and clubs for minors on Saturdays, when largely unsupervised children seem to have run wild. 

The experience of going to the cinema in Britain in the 1960s, we have found, was influenced by a variety of factors. One was class. One respondent recalls always sitting in the more 'posh' and expensive seats in the circle of her local cinema 'because I was posh.' Others, coming from a poorer background, were very impressed by the apparent luxury of the chain cinemas: one notes how much she admired the plush carpets 'because we had lino at home.' The size of the community was also a significant consideration: many cinemas in rural areas were saved from closure by the sixties boom in car ownership. This was important since in many villages and small towns, cinemas helped perpetuate a sense of local community.

Some of our respondents remember particular films or types of film because they seemed to 'speak' to their own background and preoccupations. Many liked the British 'kitchen sink' dramas of the 1960s because they came closer to reflecting the realities of Northern working-class life. Others recall a personal connection they made with certain American films such as 'The Graduate' (1967), which appealed because its emphasis on the 'generation gap' between parents and children had echoes in their own experience. Gay respondents also remember the impact films such as 'Victim' (1961) and 'A Taste of Honey' (1961), both of which featured gay characters, had on them in personal terms. 

For many respondents, however, what they remember is less the films themselves than the social aspects of cinema-going (when and why they went, who they went with, and how people behaved in the cinema). For those who attended chain cinemas, film directors are rarely noted or remembered. The opposite, however, we have discovered was true among former members of local and university film clubs, and those who attended some independent or publicly-funded cinemas. Many of these specialist audiences have strong recollections of discovering and greatly admiring the work of European directors of the time who, looking back, they perceive as offering a broader, more modern perspective - what one respondent terms 'windows on the world.' 

Many of our respondents recall cinemas as spaces for courting and youthful sexual experimentation. Some remember with nostalgia double seats with no arm-rest between them in the back rows (referred to as 'chummy' seats in Scotland). Yet we have also uncovered a darker side to 1960s cinema-going. Many female respondents remember being harassed by men if they went to the cinema on their own. Censorship, intended to protect young people, at times had the opposite effect: children, wishing to see films requiring them to be accompanied by an adult, sometimes accosted strangers (with all the risks this entailed) and asked to go with them into the theatre. At the same time, however, many respondents recall ushers as actively involved in supervising the behaviour of cinema-goers.

It seems clear from our research that patterns of audience behaviour generally changed considerably during the course of the sixties. At the start of the decade, aided perhaps by the fact that audiences were more mixed in terms of age, most audiences appear to have been quieter and better behaved. As the 1960s went on, audience behaviour became less respectful and deferential. One symptom of this was the attitude to the national anthem, played at the end of most programmes. At the start of the decade, most people stood and some sung the anthem; by the end, there was frequently what one respondent called an 'unseemly scramble' to leave the theatre before the national anthem came on.

Interviews in particular also revealed a complex pattern of cinema-going among ethnic minorities living in Britain in the sixties, especially amongst the Indian, Pakistani, and Afro-Caribbean communities. It was only towards the end of the 1960s, for example, that 'Bollywood' films began to be programmed at chain cinemas in areas with large Asian communities. Before that, there was a network of film clubs and societies that screened Bollywood films privately. Our research suggests that this viewing experience was sometimes very different from that in chain cinemas: at the Scala cinema in London, for example, screenings were often attended by Bollywood stars who introduced the films, conferring great cultural significance and value upon them for local Asian communities. We have also discovered that some members of the Indian and Pakistani communities in particular consciously watched British films as a means better to understand the culture of the country that had become their new home. Interviewees at times discuss the 'educational' value of such cinema-going activities for first-generation immigrants. In these and other ways, the project sheds considerable new light on the social and cultural history of Britain in the 1960s.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project findings will be made available to scholars in modern British history, film history, and memory studies in a variety of ways. During the course of the project, we have delivered 7 papers [3 were specified in the original application for funding] about our researches at a variety of scholarly conferences, including 'Screen,' HOMER [History of Moviegoing, Exhibition and Reception], MeCCSA [Media, Communication and Cultural Studies Association] and SCMS [Society for Cinema and Media Studies]. This has effectively publicised the work of the project throughout the scholarly community (and generated continuing invitations to speak about it to scholarly audiences). The publication of two scholarly articles was planned in the original application: three have so far appeared or are forthcoming. It was also planned to publish a monograph analysing the results of the project. A proposal for a book by the PI and Reearch Assovciates Matthew Jones and Emma Pett was submitted to the head of publishing at BFI Publishing/Palgrave Macmillan in summer 2016. This was peer-reviewed extremely favourably in late 2016 and a contract is promised shortly.

It was envisaged in the original application that the project would gather 320 questionnaires during the three-year term of the project. In fact, 900+ questionnaires have been received. We have carried out and transcribed nearly all the 80 interviews proposed in the original application. Paper copies of this material have been deposited in UCL Library. A further set will be deposited in future in the Reuben Library of the British Film Institute. In collaboration with UCL Library Services, however, we also developed an open-access online digital repository for this material at http;//www.ucl.ac.uk/library/digital-collections/collections/cinema. Both scholars and interested members of the general public will be able to search this material and the resource itself will remain online for the foreseeable future.

A crucial means of communicating with the general public, as proposed in the original 'Pathways to Impact,' was the extensive series of film screenings and discussions arranged in many places in the UK. These have been supplemented by numerous talks to local audiences and a number of radio interviews. We have shared our findings with many audiences and audience members have responded by contributing their own memories - verbally and/or by completing the project questionnaire.

What little was known about 1960s cinema-going in Britain before the project was launched focused on the white population. The project has begun the work of uncovering the untold cinema-going history of black and Asian communities living in Britain in the 1960s. We believe that our work here offers the possibility of a considerable stimulus for the development of educational resources for black and Asian history projects.

The award of one-year Follow-on Funding for Impact and Engagement (AH/P013988/1) for 'Remembering 1960s British Cinema-going' will build on the work of the original project by disseminating its findings to new audiences and publics by means of a series of events: 'immersive 60s cinema' screenings, talks and lectures to BAME and LGBT groups, local civic societies, historical association, film clubs and University of the Third Age groups, and events planned in collaboration with secondary schools.

Finally, in terms of more general dissemination, the project has prompted considerable public interest and it is very likely that the book summarising our findings will reach a general as well as a scholarly audience. In order to maximise the impact of our findings, as originally proposed in 'Pathways to Impact,' we will work energetically to publicise both the book summarising the project and the existence of our new online research repository through both social and mass media.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>E47ACDDA-A898-488F-930B-73ABEFC5ECC3</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Education,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Project members have collaborated with UCL Library Services to develop a publicly accessible online digital research repository bringing together all the 900+ anonymised questionnaires and 70+ transcripts of interviews acquired as a result of the project's work.
