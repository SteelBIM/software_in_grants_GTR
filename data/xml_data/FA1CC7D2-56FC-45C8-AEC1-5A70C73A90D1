This project proposes to use design as a kind of Trojan Horse to ?smuggle? QM approaches into areas where UGs have traditionally found the use of statistics difficult and unappealing. Our pilot work at the University of Birmingham suggested that students can more easily appreciate complex aspects of design (with a subsequent comparison of means for example) than a complex post hoc analysis, and that the former leads to greater willingness to tackle the latter.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The project will:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;develop template teaching materials, using design as a basis&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>&amp;nbsp;explain the proposed approach to a wide circle of methods trainers and student representatives; enthuse them, and together convert the templates into useable teaching resources for many specific areas of social science&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>trial and adapt them, and then make them widely and sustainably available for QM teachers across the UK.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>The work will be conducted in conjunction with the Universities of&amp;nbsp; Birmingham, York, Manchester, Leicester, Nottingham, Warwick, and Cardiff, and experts from the USA.&lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>To a large extent the immediate impact of this project, as part of the QM intitiative and RDI, will be on academic beneficaries (as described elsewhere). Those academics who are or will be responsible for delivery of lectures on social science research and methods should gain something from participation in or use of materials from this project. It is, as explained elsewhere, using the approach of design as a kind of Trojan horse to get more trainers to engage with QM teaching, and to help more students find enthusiasm for, and the relevance of, QM in their studies. The applicants are trained and experienced teachers at UG and adult edcuation level, lauded in official inspections, and with dozens of successful methods teaching texts and textbooks to their name, and whose work forms the entire basis of some methods courses in other HEIs across the world. The latter is largely due to their ability to make the complex seem simple and relevant to all UGs. The impact on trainers will be estimated via attendance, repeat 'business', website hits and downloads, evaluation forms and by a small-scale observed test of the new teaching approaches in action in a rela-life setting with UGs.

An indirect outcome of the proejct would be an increase in the supply of graduates, taught by the trainers who are the key focus of this project, for roles beyond the academic. It will not be possible to evaluate such longer term outcomes within the life of the project. We therefore rely on the opinion of those working in industry, policy or practice who are looking to recruit numerate analyticl graduates in the social sciences, such as the two nomiated user reviewers of this project. 

Impact through World Class Research: The initiative will deliver a cohort of trainers across many areas of social sciencee, able to better assist budding researchers and analysts to achieve their potential. Design is a major gap in existing methods training, and essential for the contemporary and global policy environment. 

Impact through Skilled People: The initiative addresses a significant cross-sectoral skill gap through a variety of mechanisms. It creates collaborative partnerships between researchers/academics at different stages of their careers. The community emerging from these collaborations will improve the prospects for skill transferability, employability and inter-sectoral exchanges of skilled people, thus improving flexibility and adaptability. 

Impact through Infrastructure: The initiative will significantly enhance the pool of skills among research mmethods trainers in relation to the integration of methods in an overall research design of strong scientific credibility, and assist the use of large scale data sets now becoming available through the radical transparency agenda.

Impact through International Leadership: The involvement of leading international scholars is a major component of the initiative's profile. Engaging these contributors consolidates existing relationships and opens the way for long-term future research collaborations on the theory and application of rigorous evaluations.

Impact through Partnerships: Intrinsic to the operation of the initiative will be the creation of partnerships between eight US and UK universities from the outset, and it is hoped and expected that this number will grow as part of the planned cascade. These networks and partnerships will be in place for future research, and for the career development of up-and-coming methods experts.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-05-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>41722</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Warranting research claims</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C9E102D1-FDF7-424E-892D-61E47CEFD5A9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Presentation given at the University of Leicester's staff development day.

The aim of the project was to help and influence the teachers of QM, and thus indirectly their UG (and masters) students. The project forms part of the move towards a 'new statistics', embracing judgement of substantive findings about extent rather than apparent but mistaken precision concerning binary decisions. Such an approach is safer, encourages researcher and research integrity, and allows findings to be inspected and judged by a wider audience. 
For example, we used the same approach as with QM teachers on four occasions when training groups of school leaders and teachers how to plan, conduct and analyse a rigorous evaluation of an innovation in practice. This was part of two aggregated randomised controlled trials led by schools, and funded by the Educational Endowment Foundation (see http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects/accelerated-reader/, and http://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/projects/fresh-start/). The focus on effect sizes, for pre-specified primary outcomes, was simple and very enthusiastically received by practitioners. They proved able to conduct these analyses correctly and accurately themselves. There will be other areas of public policy such as housing, health and criminal justice where these approaches would be useful. 
Phase II of the project focused on working together to simplify approaches, correct errors in teaching, provide realistic resources for teacher development, and overcome barriers to the natural integration of numbers in social science curricula. As part of this, we held four training and resource development events in three universities in England, with 70 invited attendees selected from those in Phase I, plus consultant experts. Around 40 academics continued to be involved, and 15 of these were primary authors of resources (see https://www.dur.ac.uk/education/rm/resources/). The resources from Phase II are collected on the project website which will be sustained indefinitely. The resources are for the development of QM trainers themselves and for UGs. We held two public showcase events at successive national conferences, one on the value of considering research as an argument, and the second illustrating how design aids analysis, each attended by around 60 academics and doctoral researchers across the social sciences and public policy. We organised a session at the second conference in which Larry Hedges urged the importance of effect sizes, and presented a typology with their relative merits. 
We developed a number of resources mostly for the website, but also in print, and this process is ongoing as part of the sustainability of the project. So far, these include books, chapters, papers, brief teaching guides, videos, and other resources (see below). We have also presented the work of the project around the country in at least 25 invited seminars and workshops (see below). 
In Phase III of the project, the resources were tried out in a variety of settings, including modules at Durham, Manchester and Liverpool John Moore University. Most notably they formed the entire basis for the UG QM teaching by Patrick White for social scientists at the University of Leicester, and now run for two years. This course included 60 BA and BSc students from Sociology, Criminology, Media and Communications, Politics, and Psychology. 88% agreed that the lectures were easy to follow, and 95% agreed that the lectures made effective use of visual aids. In general, feedback was excellent, and the trial at Leicester formed part of a successful application for a prestigious Teaching Fellowship. Perhaps most notable are the series of videos for UGs, showing how to use SPSS (see https://www.youtube.com/user/patrickkwhite). These are intended for stand-alone use or as part of a taught module in a blended learning format. Although in some ways SPSS is not ideal, since there is not yet a button to simply turn off the default emphasis on significance testing and asterisk-based presentation without consideration of the nature of the cases involved, the videos are innovative in the way that they ignore this. Instead they focus on the ability to explore, display and model datasets, and they do so in a way that is non-threatening to most social scientists. Feedback from UGs has been excellent. It is unusual to have comments such as these about an enforced course on statistics for all social science undergraduates:
the assignment is really good. Not like other modules only have essay. We can learn knowledge through practicing by evaluating real data via SPSS. Thank you Patrick. 
Patrick was an excellent teacher, who has a real passion for the subject which comes accross in his teaching. He made the material easy to understand, &amp;amp; I thoroughly enjoyed this module, which was really surprising as I was dreading it after the research Methods module last semester 
Patrick is such a nice lecturer! He makes research methods much more interesting than it should be! Love having his lectures! Thanks!!
Patrik was an excellent teacher. He made everything seem so easy, and he want out his wasy to prepare extra materials to help us understand what we had to do. I was dreading this module after last semester, but acctually I really enjoyed it. I hope that we have Patrik again for another module.
The module leader was great and enthusiastic. He made things very easy to understand in order to be able to do them by ourselves. Lectures were very interesting! Seminars have been great all along the term, with the tutor explaining things tyhoroughly and making everything clear to us. Overall, it was a very interesting module which made many of the students more enthusiastic for research methods.


Support across country
Considerable discussion has taken place on SAGE Methodspace, where queries by researchers worldwide have been addressed, project resources have been directly uploaded, and a Case Study produced for the first round to be published by SAGE. The researchers have also conducted lengthy discussions via Twitter and the NCRM Quantitative Methods email list. So far, the project has produced one methods book, 12 peer-reviewed methods papers, 4 book chapters in methods texts, one case study, 29 invited presentations wholly or partly about this project, and the resources themselves. A complete boom using all of the resources is in preparation and will be submitted to SAGE in the first instance.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>2A73B815-96B7-47A3-9118-078948987979</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Education</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>In Phase I of the project, we registered 204 teachers (and upcoming teachers) of 'quantitative' methods from a wide range of social sciences and the humanities. These were in addition to the members of the project team and their consultant experts. All expressed interest in the premise of the project, and hoped both to contribute and learn more. The project had a focus on working with the teachers, rather than their students directly. 

We held seven recruitment events, with 146 distinct attendees. The events took place in seven university centres, across England and Wales, and were open to all QM teachers. Each recruitment event consisted of a workshop led by the local host, on a range of themes including developing research questions, the elements of research design, problems of attrition, and more generally what is 'wrong' with QM teaching. The last two such events had already begun to work on possible solutions. Each workshop was followed by small group discussion of the challenges and barriers to teaching social science topics and analyses using numbers. The results were collected by a scribe in each group and also via a written confidential feedback form completed by all attendees. The key points of a meta-synthesis of feedback were as follows. 

There is considerable variability in the experience and prior qualifications of QM-relevant teachers, with some just thrown in as the most recent arrivals with no pedagogic training. Many teachers mentioned fear both for themselves and their students. Senior staff who use QM regularly for research are seldom required to teach these skills to UGs. The teachers themselves often confused methods of data collection with research design. What they had been taught was often poorly explained and plain incorrect - especially in relation to significance testing and related issues. These errors are then transmitted to new generations of students. Numeric data are seldom used naturally in substantive courses, and those lecturers prepared to use numbers are forced to become QM 'experts' for methods courses seen as irrelevant by many students. Fuller reports are available at:
https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/education/research/ESRC-Interim-report-July-2013-.pdf)
https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/education/research/ug-quantitative-methods-phaseone-completion.pdf.
The users for this RDI project are other academics such as QM teachers, and less directly their UG charges. The project forms part of the move towards a 'new statistics', embracing judgement of substantive findings about extent rather than apparent but mistaken precision concerning binary decisions. Such an approach is safer, encourages researcher and research integrity, and allows findings to be inspected and judged by a wider audience. As part of that move, this project may, via impact on staff and students, help improve the quality of work with numbers in social science, its wider use, and its easier interpretation by potential research users. 

For example, we used the same approach as with QM teachers on four occasions when training groups of school leaders and teachers how to plan, conduct and analyse a rigorous evaluation of an innovation in practice. This was part of two aggregated randomised controlled trials led by schools, and funded by the Educational Endowment Foundation. The focus on effect sizes, for pre-specified primary outcomes, was simple and very enthusiastically received by practitioners. They proved able to conduct these analyses correctly and accurately themselves. There will be other areas of public policy such as housing, health and criminal justice where these approaches would be useful. 

One of the many barriers to impact is the sheer number of intiatives (reducing attendance at each event perhaps), and the lack of quality control in the kinds of QM resources now publicly available. The latter can lead trainers and students to regard what are matters of fact as though they were matters of opinion.




Some of the issues raised were specific to individuals and their HE contexts. Some were general but also beyond the scope of this project - low levels of numeracy among potential UGs, for example. Phase II of the project focussed on working together to simplify approaches, correct errors in teaching, provide realistic resources for teacher development, and overcome barriers to the natural integration of numbers in social science curricula. As part of this, we held four training and resource development events in three universities in England, with 70 invited attendees selected from those in Phase I, plus consultant experts. Around 40 academics continued to be involved, and 15 of these were primary authors of resources. We held two public showcase events at successive national confences, one on the value of considering reseach as an argument, and the second illustrating how design aids analysis, each attended by around 60 academics and doctoral researchers across the social sciences and public policy. We organised a session at the second conference in which Larry Hedges urged the importance of effect sizes, and presented a typology with their relative merits. 

We developed a number of resources mostly for the website, but also in print, and this process is ongoing as part of the sustainability of the project. So far, these include books, chapters, papers, brief teaching guides, videos, and other resources (see below). In Phase III of the project, these were tried out in a variety of settings, most notably the UG QM teaching by Patrick White for all social scientists at the University of Leicester. Feedback has been excellent, and the trial at Lecicester formed part of a successful application for a Teaching Fellowship (just awarded). We have also presented the work of the project around the country in at least 25 invited seminars and workshops (see below). 
The resources from Phase II are being collected on the project website which will be sustained indefinitely. The resources are for the development of QM trainers themselves and for UGs. They need organising further into a narrative for each audience so that they can be used more easily in modules, and in an appropriate sequence. They also need 'advertising' and in some cases academic justification. This is being achieved by a combination of peer-reviewed publication, presentation, lecture tours, videos, social media, and email list discussions. Considerable discussion has taken place on SAGE Methodspace, where queries by researchers worldwide have been addressed, project resources have been directly uploaded, and a Case Study produced for the first round to be published by SAGE.

So far, the project has produced one methods book, 10 peer-reviewed methods papers, 4 book chapters in methods texts, one case study, 29 invited presentations wholly or partly about this project, and the resources themselves. These include sections on:

Starting out
Research Design
Identifying the cases
The behaviour of numbers
Presenting one value at a time
Presenting a comparison of two or more values 
Random sampling theory and its serious limitations
The meaning of numeric results
Working with existing data

Perhaps most notable are the series of videos for UGs, showing how to use SPSS. These are intended for stand-alone use or as part of a taught module in a blended learning format. Although in some ways SPSS is not ideal, since there is not yet a button to simply turn off the default emphasis on significance testing and asterisk-based presentation without consideration of the nature of the cases involved, the videos are innovative in the way that they ignore this. Instead they focus on the ability to explore, display and model datasets, and they do so in a way that is non-threatening to most social scientists. Feedback from UGs has been universally excellent.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>-To be used as a teaching resource
