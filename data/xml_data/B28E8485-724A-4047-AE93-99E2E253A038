Research.</gtr:title><gtr:status>Closed</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>MR/L004933/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With the rising demands on the resources available for health care, it is increasingly important that decision makers, including practitioners, patients, policy makers and the public, have access to reliable and robust information about the relative effects of different interventions they might choose between. This information primarily comes from clinical trials which compared the interventions, and trials themselves need to be conducted in ways that are efficient and effective. In 2009, the MRC established the Hubs for Trials Methodology Research to conduct research to achieve this, and to facilitate the implementation of the findings of this research into practice in trials. A Network was created to add value to the work of the individual Hubs and this proposal seeks to renew the work of the Network for five more years and to extend the work to include a programme of training that will build capacity in methodology research for the future. This will be achieved by a unique programme of PhD studentships in trial methodology, which will create new experts in this area.

The Hubs provide a UK-wide, regionally distributed research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. The Network links the Hubs to enhance their individual activities, strengthen the methodological research further, and improve dissemination and education relating to good methods in clinical trials. The Network provides funds for high priority research to answer specific issues around trials; conducts workshops to develop methods and train people involved in trials; organises a large international conference every two years to bring researchers together to share their current research and learn from each other; and, will establish and implement a new programme for PhD students to train as methodologists within a national programme of methodology research.

The Network helps the Hubs to work with many people and organisations who are key to clinical trials in the UK and internationally. These include those who fund trials, such as the National Institute for Health Research and major charities including Cancer Research UK, Arthritis UK and the British Heart Foundation; those who organise trials, including the pharmaceutical industry and universities; the groups that support them, including the UK-registered Clinical Trials Units, Research Design Services and Contract Research Organisations in the private sector; as well as the users of health care and individuals who run trials in academia, practice and industry. 

Under this proposal, the Network will continue with its four main objectives and add a fifth relating to the PhD studentships. These objectives are:
a) Promoting high quality collaborative methodological research, both across Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally.
b) Providing methodological advice to the clinical trials community.
c) Encouraging the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing a coordinated package of education and training. 
d) Working with external stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance.
e) Capacity building of training in the UK by supporting a cohort of clinical and non-clinical PhD students in methodology.

The coordination of this studentship programme by the Network will:
&amp;gt; Create a cadre of scientists, including clinicians, with skills that will place them at the forefront of trials methodology development.
&amp;gt; Align the PhD studentships with the Network's strategic aims and research priorities, while reflecting the priorities of the Hub in which the student is based.
&amp;gt; Offer students unique inter-disciplinary and diverse analytical and technical skill training.
&amp;gt; Develop and sustain a vibrant postgraduate student culture in the Network.
&amp;gt; Raise the profile of the studentship programme, to attract outstanding candidates.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>The Network has added value to the Hubs for Trials Methodology Research by coordinating activities, encouraging and facilitating high-priority research projects, and facilitating the implementation of good practice into clinical trials in the UK and internationally. The Network facilitates the conduct and implementation of research into the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials through cross-Hub work, as well as work between the Hubs and external teams. The Hubs and the Working Groups serve as key elements in delivering the strategy. The Network's objectives for the next period will be:
a) Promoting high quality collaborative methodological research, both across Hubs and with other groups, UK-wide and internationally
b) Providing methodological advice to the clinical trials community
c) Encouraging the implementation of the most effective and appropriate methodological practice, for example by providing a coordinated package of education and training 
d) Working with external stakeholders, in particular to agree on shared priorities for research and guidance
e) Capacity building of training in the UK by supporting a cohort of clinical and non-clinical PhD students in methodology.
The work encompasses research into various aspects of clinical trial methods, including adaptive designs, statistical analysis, selection of outcomes and reporting of data. The Network resources are managed by the MRC CTU in London, with the Hub Directors as key drivers of the science, along with the convenors of six Working Groups, supported by the Network Co-ordinator. 

There are close links to the UK-registered Clinical Trials Units, charities and research funders, and policy makers. The Network will strengthen its relationships with industry and build on existing relationships with clinicians through, for example, the Royal Colleges and with patients and the public through, for example, INVOLVE and the James Lind Alliance.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Who will benefit from this research?
The Network will benefit the clinical trials community in the UK as a whole, including those working in academia, practice and industry. The research undertaken by the Network, the Hubs and the Working Groups addresses how clinical trials are conducted and provides a research resource to improve the design, conduct, analysis, interpretation, and reporting of clinical trials. This is also likely to benefit trials outside the UK.

How will they benefit from this research?
We will continue to ensure engagement between stakeholders and the Network, in particular through our Working Groups. This will ensure that high priority issues are tackled and that stakeholders benefit from the collective knowledge of the Network.

Our regular meetings with the Directors of the CTUs will continue and partnerships will be extended through the Working Groups and the conduct of Network funded projects in areas identified as high priority by the CTUs.

Our main impact outside of academia is likely to be through stronger engagement with the other major source of clinical trials in the UK, namely the pharmaceutical industry. We will continue to work with the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries, through engaging with the Experimental medicines expert network, and by attending appropriate meetings such as the R&amp;amp;D Conference in partnership with BIA and NOCRI. We will strengthen engagement with appropriate professional bodies (e.g. ensuring Network presence at meetings, including PSI conferences). We will provide opportunities for industry to present and participate in the Clinical Trials Methodology Conferences, ensuring their exposure to current methodological developments. We will work with Contract Research Organisations and software companies (such as Oracle Health Sciences Global Business Unit) who provide the infrastructure support for many industry trials. Further benefits will arise from the Network exploiting its capacity to act as a conduit between academia and industry, providing a link in the translational research pathway and ensuring that key issues are addressed via the Network Working Groups. 

We will continue our engagement with charities, including the main funders of clinical trials in the UK: MRC, Health Technology Assessment Programme of the National Institute for Health Research, Cancer Research UK, Arthritis Research UK (ARUK), British Heart Foundation. This will build on previous collaborations, including, for example, joint funding for workshops between ARUK and the Network. Trial funders will also benefit from Network advice on the appropriate information to collect when funding is being requested for new trials, and during trials (such as in the 'go/no go' decision after a feasibility study).
 
The Network will continue to engage with regulatory bodies and similar agencies, including the Medicines and Health Regulatory Agency, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and the European Medicines Agency. This will ensure that the Network remains a key source of knowledge and influence in the development of new regulations. 

The Network will strengthen its engagement with patient and public initiatives, including INVOLVE, which supports the involvement of the public in health and social care research. Individual Hubs have already worked with INVOLVE on issues relating to the involvement of patients in clinical trials.

The Network will continue its work to promote good practice in clinical trials to a wide range of healthcare practitioners. This will include the provision of training in trials, publications and presentations aimed at practitioners rather than researchers, and further work to improve understanding and interpretation of the results of trials, including through systematic reviews.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C"><gtr:id>C008C651-F5B0-4859-A334-5F574AB6B57C</gtr:id><gtr:name>MRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>3381061</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Lancaster University</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>N83- Improving the design and analysis of trials for efficacy and mechanisms evaluation: workshop and training days.</gtr:description><gtr:id>68067319-6CEA-4036-9A6F-4F1AB2DA9731</gtr:id><gtr:impact>na</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The MRC/NIHR EME Programme funds clinical studies testing both if an intervention works in a defined population of patients, and providing opportunity to understand disease or treatment mechanisms. However, there remain significant methodological challenges in performing mechanistic evaluations and accounting for departures from randomised allocations in order to assess efficacy (rather than effectiveness). Uptake of the available methods has been limited, though increasing in popularity.

Our aim is to organise a workshop and training day centred on how to use causal methods to understand mechanisms of action for treatments. The workshop will invite experts in the area to identify important topics and challenges and to discuss ways in which these methods might be utilised more in clinical research studies. A representative from the EME board will give an overview of the scheme, and how they consider mechanisms evaluation when evaluating applications. The results of this workshop will inform a training day approximately six months later for researchers who are interested in incorporating mechanistic methods into their clinical studies.

Workshop

We will hold a one-day workshop in Lancaster in 2016. We will invite key stakeholders from the area, including representatives from the EME board, and discuss issues and suitable methods for different types of intervention: pharmaceutical, psychotherapy, behaviour change, and surgery. The outcomes of the workshop will be used to develop a training day for researchers in clinical studies.

Training day.

Six months after the one day workshop we will hold a one day training workshop, also provisionally in Lancaster. This workshop will be aimed at clinicians and methodologists new to the area and who are in the process of designing mechanistic studies, and intending to apply for EME funding. We plan to use organisations such as the NIHR Clinical Research Network, the RDS, and EME to advertise to find applicants</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding for this research</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PhD student P27- Statistical design and analysis of cluster-randomised stepped wedge / phased implementation trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA49ACB8-393D-468A-965E-BFE1F9AB8F53</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Ongoing PhD studentship.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner is a Hub within the Network and they supervise the PhD student- ref P27</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding of PhD student P27- Statistical design and analysis of cluster-randomised stepped wedge / phased implementation trials.

The ultimate aim is to measure the biomarker in clinical practice and use the results to stratify patients, treating them differently depending on the stratum they are in. However, whilst genetic biomarkers with their typically categorical nature lend themselves easily to the idea of stratification, it is not so clear how continuous biomarkers should be used in this way. In addition, before implementing a biomarker to guide treatment in clinical practice, the effectiveness of the biomarker guided approach to treatment must be demonstrated, typically in the form of a biomarker guided trial. However, the design of such trials typically assumes dichotomisation of the biomarker, which loses substantial statistical efficiency. It is unclear how continuous biomarkers should be incorporated and at what stage of the clinical development process the biomarker information should be dichotomised. In this project we propose to review methodologies for determining how to optimally stratify patients using continuous biomarkers, both in the context of a single biomarker and where a panel of biomarkers are predictive, as well as considering at what timepoint during the biomarker's development this decision should be made. The methodologies used in the evidence base for biomarkers already recommended for clinical use will also be investigated. Based on this work we will be able to provide guidance for researchers on the most suitable approach to use. We will also aim to identify gaps in methodology that future work can address.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Ulster</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>N73- Exploring design and use of incentives for recruitment and retention in clinical trials: a workshop and a review.</gtr:description><gtr:id>F5088DAE-AD5A-4D99-8A31-98B834C35827</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none to date</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The key aim of this project is to describe the scope of incentives in trials, to explore their design and use and describe their potential effects on trial outcomes.

The workshop was attended by 31 delegates (plus the 7 speakers). There have been a lot of recent developments on metamodelling techniques, and this workshop enabled these methods to be presented together with demonstrations of software that has recently been made available , using a common example. 

The feedback from the workshop delegates was very positive, and the discussions at the end of the day indicated that the software developments in particular had made the methods more accessible for use in real applications</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Partners in development of a workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided to develop a new workshop on metamodelling techniques.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>PhD studentship- Q42 Spatial Analysis of Cluster-Randomised Trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>CB153619-FC56-4B92-B8F0-C94BD9A2EE0D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing PhD studentship</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner is a Hub within the Network and they supervise the PhD student- ref Q42</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding of PhD studentship- Q42 Spatial Analysis of Cluster-Randomised Trials.

In the collective experience of members of the Health Economic Resource Use and Costs Working Group, there is currently substantial variation in the structure, format and content of HEAPs, and no real agreement on either their purpose or appropriate methods of oversight. Clarity on the need for, and appropriate usage of, HEAPs would be advantageous.

We therefore propose to hold a workshop on HEAPs for about 50 attendees in Bristol, with three key aims. First, we plan to review the limited number of currently available guidelines addressing aspects of HEAPs. We also intend to collate information about the current usage of HEAPs in terms of their structure, content and purpose. Finally, we aim to provide a forum in which health economists and other interested parties engaged in applied economic evaluations can open a dialogue on appropriate methods of standardisation with a view to creating guidance in future work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided.

To identify the key content and develop a template for health economic analysis plans that will guide analysts in conducting economic evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Background
The use of SAPs, drawn up in advance of the analysis phase of a trial, is an accepted means of reducing bias in reporting the results of RCTs. However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance. In October 2015, an HTMR-funded workshop involving fifty (predominantly academic) participants was held to discuss some of the issues associated with HEAPs. Feedback from the workshop suggested that health economists would value guidance and clarity on the appropriate content of a HEAP.

Methods
Building on recent work led by the NW Hub to create guidance for SAPs, we propose to develop a template for a HEAP. We plan to use 'real time' Delphi methodology, which involves presenting dynamic feedback to participants, to gain a consensus opinion on the relevant content of a HEAP. 

A literature review will identify published HEAPs and additional examples will be sought from practising health economists in order to derive a list of items for inclusion in an electronic Delphi survey. A panel of experts will be recruited and, after seeding the survey with responses from randomly selected attendees of the workshop, the survey will be opened to the panel for a period of one month. The project team will convene at the end of the survey to discuss the results with invited participants in a consensus meeting. The final list of items will be developed into a template HEAP, which will be disseminated widely.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC ConDuCT Trials Methodology Hub</gtr:department><gtr:description>R23: A conference on maximising the value of qualitative research in randomised controlled trials (RCTs)</gtr:description><gtr:id>70E32D75-0C0C-4920-A503-52BD33127200</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Publication: PMC4659339
3. The following events arose as a direct outcome of this project:
a. Professor Jenny Donovan applied for a symposium at the Society for Clinical Trials in Boston, USA. Professors Jenny Donovan, Bridget Young, Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain and Dr Nicola Mills gave this symposium on using qualitative research to revolutionize trials on 22 May 2013 to 70 delegates from the USA and Europe.
b. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join the scientific committee of the Clinical Trials Methodology Conference to be held in November 2013 in order to lead a theme on the use of qualitative research with trials. Currently, 22 abstracts have been submitted to the qualitative research theme and abstracts are being selected for oral and poster presentation. 
c. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join an MRC funded project writing guidance for undertaking process evaluations with trials. Professor Jenny Donovan accepted an invitation to be an external advisor on this project. 
d. Workshop and symposium members are writing a journal article 'O'Cathain A, Adamson J, Donovan J, Hoddinott P, Jansen Y, Lewin S, Mills N, Moore G, Thomas K, Young B. Guidance on using qualitative research in feasibility studies for randomized controlled trials.' We have approached the editor of the journal Trials who has responded positively to the proposed submission. The first draft was discussed by symposium members and a further draft is underway. Discussions are also underway for an article on developing interventions, led by Professor Pat Hoddinott.
e. Professors Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain joined the COnDUCT-II bid to strengthen the qualitative theme. This has been funded to start in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>1. The conference was held on 21 November 2012 in Sheffield with 91 attendees from England, Scotland, Wales, Norway and The Netherlands. 97% of 38 delegates returning the evaluation form said it was an excellent or good day. Their feedback was that they felt that the talks were inspiring and they wanted further events to offer training and discussion.
2. The workshop was held on 22 November in Sheffield with 9 members: Professor Pat Hoddinott (Stirling), Professor Bridget Young (Liverpool, NW Hub), Professor Kate Thomas (Sheffield), Professor Jenny Donovan (Bristol, COnDUCT Hub), Dr Joy Adamson (York), Dr Simon Lewin (Norway), Dr Yvonne Jansen (The Netherlands), Dr Graham Moore (Cardiff) and Professor Alicia O'Cathain (Sheffield). The discussion focused on developing guidance for the use of qualitative research in feasibility studies for trials because the MRC has already funded a group to develop guidance for process evaluations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding for conference and associated workshop .</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC ConDuCT Trials Methodology Hub</gtr:department><gtr:description>N55- Development of a quality assessment tool for core outcome set development</gtr:description><gtr:id>903D1EA0-B586-456F-9586-E204ECA6F543</gtr:id><gtr:impact>none to date</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A review of the literature has identified core outcome sets in nearly 200 medical conditions, and we are also aware of over 30 ongoing projects.

The aim of this project is to identify trials methodology research priorities in LMICs. We predict each region can gain valuable lessons from the other.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network has provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Charity/Non Profit</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC ConDuCT Trials Methodology Hub</gtr:department><gtr:description>N65- Mapping current usage of Health Economic Analysis Plans (HEAPs)</gtr:description><gtr:id>FED30718-55D6-4458-AB3A-6D307DADCCE5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The use of statistical analysis plans (SAPs), drawn up in advance of the analysis phase of a trial, is an accepted means of reducing bias in reporting the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance, and there is a fundamental question over whether they add value to the trial process at all. In the collective experience of members of the Health Economic Resource Use and Costs Working Group, there is currently substantial variation in the structure, format and content of HEAPs, and no real agreement on either their purpose or appropriate methods of oversight. Clarity on the need for, and appropriate usage of, HEAPs would be advantageous.

We therefore propose to hold a workshop on HEAPs for about 50 attendees in Bristol, with three key aims. First, we plan to review the limited number of currently available guidelines addressing aspects of HEAPs. We also intend to collate information about the current usage of HEAPs in terms of their structure, content and purpose. Finally, we aim to provide a forum in which health economists and other interested parties engaged in applied economic evaluations can open a dialogue on appropriate methods of standardisation with a view to creating guidance in future work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided.

The NIHR has provided definitions which are helpful, however, it can be very unclear when to undertake feasibility work, or a pilot RCT and whether an internal or external pilot is the best choice of design. The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian). However, there remains some key unanswered questions in this field. In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event. The combined activities will build on our individual expertise and lead to guidance documents to be published, material to be made available on the web and further meetings with clinical trialists and funding bodies to widely implement the recommendations for when to conduct each type of pilot and/or feasibility study design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>London School of Economics and Political Science (University of London)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>LSE Health and Social Care</gtr:department><gtr:description>DIRUM</gtr:description><gtr:id>5EA186E9-FB09-4C6C-9682-B87EBE1B4087</gtr:id><gtr:impact>publications and presentations at conference including:

- Since going live in June 2011, the database has had over 13,000 visits with over a third of these coming from outside the UK. To date, the database now contains 73 resource use measures which have been downloaded over 3700 times.
- Between 2012-14, DIRUM has been a cited in the protocols involved in 8 NIHR HTA funded clinical trials securing grants to the total value of &amp;pound;5.4 million [1]. For example, in the PRACTICE and Cardiff breastfeeding trials, DIRUM will help inform the development of the resource use questionnaires used to study the health economics [2], whereas in the LASER trial, a patient RUM will be developed for inclusion in DIRUM and validated by comparing recorded hospital resource use with reported patient resource use. [3]
- DIRUM is signposted from the NIHR Research Design Service websites as a resource for trial health economists. DIRUM has been cited in at least 32 peer-reviewed publications and is referenced in CTU standard operating procedures and key texts in economic evaluation. [4-6]
- A review of DIRUM instruments has been published in the 2015 PSSRU unit cost manual, which has an estimated number of readers reaching 11,000 and the volumes cited in 65% of English health and social care economic evaluations. [7]
- Several related methodological projects have emerged as a consequence of the DIRUM database. These include the development of a single modular resource use measure (HTMR Ref N57), and the compilation of 90 methodological research papers concerning cost analyses in clinical trials. DIRUM also forms part of a substantive review of methods in trial-based economic evaluation [8].

Trial validity must be assessed to ensure that synthesised evidence provides a reliable basis for decision-making. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool for assessment of biases in RCTs is widely used for this purpose. It is tailored for assessment of standard parallel-group trials, and only limited guidance is available for more complex designs, e.g. cross-over and cluster trials. We will refine and improve the Cochrane ROB tool for RCTs to bring it in line with recent developments in ROB assessment and expand it to include guidance on cluster and cross-over trials. We will improve the usability and robustness of the tool by adding signalling questions, which guide the assessor to consider all relevant threats to validity within each bias domain. We will provide clearer guidance for reaching an overall outcome- and study-level risk of bias judgement and on how to incorporate overall judgment into meta-analyses and review conclusions. This new structure and additional guidance will lead to more robust bias assessment and improve future trial design by highlighting biases that should be avoided. The project will include four stages: (i) Develop new version of the tool with signalling questions and associated guidelines, informed by a meeting with expert methodologists and users of current ROB tool and review of recent empirical evidence for bias; (ii) Pilot - we will host a supported piloting event where reviewers of varied experience will pilot the tool, supported by members of the development team, and provide critical feedback; (iii) Refine the final version of the tool and produce guidance, informed by piloting feedback and reliability analyses; (iv) Implementation and active dissemination of the tool through publication, provision of worked examples, and integration with Cochrane methods and procedures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided for this project.

3. The following events arose as a direct outcome of this project:
a. Professor Jenny Donovan applied for a symposium at the Society for Clinical Trials in Boston, USA. Professors Jenny Donovan, Bridget Young, Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain and Dr Nicola Mills gave this symposium on using qualitative research to revolutionize trials on 22 May 2013 to 70 delegates from the USA and Europe.
b. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join the scientific committee of the Clinical Trials Methodology Conference to be held in November 2013 in order to lead a theme on the use of qualitative research with trials. Currently, 22 abstracts have been submitted to the qualitative research theme and abstracts are being selected for oral and poster presentation. 
c. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join an MRC funded project writing guidance for undertaking process evaluations with trials. Professor Jenny Donovan accepted an invitation to be an external advisor on this project. 
d. Workshop and symposium members are writing a journal article 'O'Cathain A, Adamson J, Donovan J, Hoddinott P, Jansen Y, Lewin S, Mills N, Moore G, Thomas K, Young B. Guidance on using qualitative research in feasibility studies for randomized controlled trials.' We have approached the editor of the journal Trials who has responded positively to the proposed submission. The first draft was discussed by symposium members and a further draft is underway. Discussions are also underway for an article on developing interventions, led by Professor Pat Hoddinott.
e. Professors Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain joined the COnDUCT-II bid to strengthen the qualitative theme. This has been funded to start in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>1. The conference was held on 21 November 2012 in Sheffield with 91 attendees from England, Scotland, Wales, Norway and The Netherlands. 97% of 38 delegates returning the evaluation form said it was an excellent or good day.

1. A survey of UK and Ireland CTUs was undertaken to gather information on how 
they: (i) identify available data sources and assess them for suitability in relation 
to recruitment feasibility assessment; (ii) identify potential patients for studies via 
the electronic patient record and the challenges they experience; (iii) use the EPR 
for outcome data collection and determine the suitability of such data sources.
2. Case studies from the survey were presented at the workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided: This application involves Hubs in the Health Informatics Working Group. The meeting fits

This can provide substantial benefits including increased efficiency and ethics. However they are also more complicated than traditional designs. Thus reporting of trials using an adaptive design is difficult, leading to concerns about interpretability and reproducibility of adaptive trials that may hamper their uptake in practice.
Previous work has identified the need for reporting guidelines for trials using adaptive designs. The CONSORT guidance framework has substantially improved the reporting of randomised controlled trials. However, there is no guidance tailored for the reporting of adaptive trials. This proposal is part of a larger project that will develop and disseminate a CONSORT extension for adaptive trials. 
This proposal will improve the quality and international impact of the developed guidance through three activities. 
The first is a consensus workshop that will bring together around 30 multidisciplinary experts in adaptive trials from around the world. The workshop participants will consist of representatives from academia, industry and regulatory agencies. By including international representatives in person (rather than via telephone), we believe the developed guidance will be of much higher quality and more relevant to a worldwide audience.
The second is a dissemination workshop that will present the guidance to a UK audience. We will invite around 60 individuals that represent a variety of stakeholders including medical journal editors, academic trialists and industry representatives.
The third is to present the guidance at the SCT conference in 2018, which will help disseminate the guidance beyond the UK.
We expect the development of the guidance to raise important gaps in methodology that need to be addressed. Thus, the dissemination workshop will also involve discussions to identify these. In the longer term we hope that this may lead to additional useful methodology research.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Leeds Clinical Trials Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>N62- Methods for Patient and Public Involvement in Clinical Trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>C201A0D5-38D2-4A23-BED1-D23935C601FE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>non to date</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>.

There is an adaptive design outreach officer - paid for by the Network- who is undertaking regular visits to CTUs and is working on new research methodologies.

Future objectives: The Network plays a vital role in increasing the implementation of adaptive design methodology, with the main barriers to implementation already identified as a lack of software and a lack of expertise. The future plans for this group include continued annual meetings, strengthening the engagement with industry and the development of collaborative inter-Hub visits to develop novel adaptive designs. The group is focusing its efforts on preparing tutorial papers for applied journals and mainstream medical journals; presentations and lectures to increase uptake of methods among stakeholders; and the development of computer software to help researchers to undertake trials with adaptive designs.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The HTMR Network supported the Adaptive Designs Working Group (WG) to regularly meet and exchange ideas.

The NIHR has provided definitions which are helpful, however, it can be very unclear when to undertake feasibility work, or a pilot RCT and whether an internal or external pilot is the best choice of design. The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian). However, there remains some key unanswered questions in this field. In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event. The combined activities will build on our individual expertise and lead to guidance documents to be published, material to be made available on the web and further meetings with clinical trialists and funding bodies to widely implement the recommendations for when to conduct each type of pilot and/or feasibility study design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Edinburgh</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>R45: Establishing a database of statistical expertise to support clinical trial oversight committees and develop capacity</gtr:description><gtr:id>1381F617-02B0-4BBB-B309-3408C81E9203</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Expected outcome- development of a database</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Research collaborators working on development of database</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funded research project

This has been a notable issue in surgical trials, with preferences for interventions common and a lack of research-active senior surgeons. Recently, several initiatives are changing this. The Royal College of Surgeons have invested in Surgical Trials Centres and Speciality Leads to promote trial participation. Twenty-four surgical Trainee Research Collaboratives (TRCs) have also been established across the UK, which allow trainees to become involved in trials within a large collaborative research group. These TRCs have completed several surgical trials, and have recently spread to anaesthetics. Benefits include improved trial recruitment and a research-active consultant workforce. The reasons for the TRCs' success are unknown but understanding them is key to potential wider translation to other clinical areas. 
Aims: This project aims to 1) identify the key elements leading to successful trials conducted by surgical TRCs and 2) synthesise these findings to develop strategies to enhance clinician engagement in trials across other clinical specialties, including clinician training.
Methods: A qualitative research study to inform a one day trialist stakeholders workshop. The research will include: 1) non-participant observation of TRC-linked surgical trials and TRC meetings, and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews with key clinicians and trials units staff. Trials and linked personnel will be purposefully sampled across three geographical locations to include a variety of surgical specialties, clinicians and TRCs. Meetings and interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis of transcripts will use the constant comparative method. 
Outputs: Results will be synthesised and reviewed by co-applicants. These will inform a meeting with key trialists and clinical stakeholders to develop strategies to enhance clinicians' engagement in trials which could subsequently be tested in other specialties and inform post-graduate clinician training.

Received Network funding for specific collaboration on developing a recruitment database</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Scope- The Trial Recruitment Working Group is identifying the most effective and efficient strategies for recruitment to trials, with methodology studies inside and outside the Hubs. It facilitates networking and collaborative research across the Hubs to improve trial recruitment, and collaborates with the UKCRC Registered CTU Network to implement, evaluate and use recruitment interventions across clinical trials in the UK and beyond.
 
Future Objectives- The collaboration between this Working Group and the CTUs will continue, with trial recruitment identified as the top priority for methodology research by the CTU Directors in a survey led by the North West Hub. The Group is reviewing difficulties that arise in trial recruitment from trial approvals through to trial completion on time and to cost, and generating momentum to make the on-going evaluation of new methods a routine activity. The Working Group's projects will help with the understanding of the recruitment process, address recruiter and other trial staff training issues, develop feasibility and pilot studies, build on innovative qualitative methods to study various aspects of recruitment, evaluate the use of health informatics approaches, improve access to 'hard to reach' patients, and develop a core outcome set for future methodological studies of patient centeredness and effectiveness in trial recruitment.
 
There will be continued promotion of the MRC Systematic Techniques for Assisting Recruitment to Trials (MRC START) model across the UK, and use of the START website (www.population-health.manchester.ac.uk/mrcstart) as a repository for trial recruitment interventions and related protocols, encouraging wider adoption of these by trial teams and standardisation across the trial portfolio.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The HTMR Network supports the Trial Recruitment Working Group (WG) to regularly meet and exchange ideas.

- Since going live in June 2011, the database has had over 13,000 visits with over a third of these coming from outside the UK. To date, the database now contains 73 resource use measures which have been downloaded over 3700 times.
- Between 2012-14, DIRUM has been a cited in the protocols involved in 8 NIHR HTA funded clinical trials securing grants to the total value of &amp;pound;5.4 million [1]. For example, in the PRACTICE and Cardiff breastfeeding trials, DIRUM will help inform the development of the resource use questionnaires used to study the health economics [2], whereas in the LASER trial, a patient RUM will be developed for inclusion in DIRUM and validated by comparing recorded hospital resource use with reported patient resource use. [3]
- DIRUM is signposted from the NIHR Research Design Service websites as a resource for trial health economists. DIRUM has been cited in at least 32 peer-reviewed publications and is referenced in CTU standard operating procedures and key texts in economic evaluation. [4-6]
- A review of DIRUM instruments has been published in the 2015 PSSRU unit cost manual, which has an estimated number of readers reaching 11,000 and the volumes cited in 65% of English health and social care economic evaluations. [7]
- Several related methodological projects have emerged as a consequence of the DIRUM database. These include the development of a single modular resource use measure (HTMR Ref N57), and the compilation of 90 methodological research papers concerning cost analyses in clinical trials. DIRUM also forms part of a substantive review of methods in trial-based economic evaluation [8].

To identify the key content and develop a template for health economic analysis plans that will guide analysts in conducting economic evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Background
The use of SAPs, drawn up in advance of the analysis phase of a trial, is an accepted means of reducing bias in reporting the results of RCTs. However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance. In October 2015, an HTMR-funded workshop involving fifty (predominantly academic) participants was held to discuss some of the issues associated with HEAPs. Feedback from the workshop suggested that health economists would value guidance and clarity on the appropriate content of a HEAP.

Methods
Building on recent work led by the NW Hub to create guidance for SAPs, we propose to develop a template for a HEAP. We plan to use 'real time' Delphi methodology, which involves presenting dynamic feedback to participants, to gain a consensus opinion on the relevant content of a HEAP. 

A literature review will identify published HEAPs and additional examples will be sought from practising health economists in order to derive a list of items for inclusion in an electronic Delphi survey. A panel of experts will be recruited and, after seeding the survey with responses from randomly selected attendees of the workshop, the survey will be opened to the panel for a period of one month. The project team will convene at the end of the survey to discuss the results with invited participants in a consensus meeting. The final list of items will be developed into a template HEAP, which will be disseminated widely.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Leeds</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>R45: Establishing a database of statistical expertise to support clinical trial oversight committees and develop capacity</gtr:description><gtr:id>8FB42FD8-E860-44B0-87F0-92D06C2E74B1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Expected outcome- development of a database</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Research collaborators working on development of database</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funded research project

Trial validity must be assessed to ensure that synthesised evidence provides a reliable basis for decision-making. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool for assessment of biases in RCTs is widely used for this purpose. It is tailored for assessment of standard parallel-group trials, and only limited guidance is available for more complex designs, e.g. cross-over and cluster trials. We will refine and improve the Cochrane ROB tool for RCTs to bring it in line with recent developments in ROB assessment and expand it to include guidance on cluster and cross-over trials. We will improve the usability and robustness of the tool by adding signalling questions, which guide the assessor to consider all relevant threats to validity within each bias domain. We will provide clearer guidance for reaching an overall outcome- and study-level risk of bias judgement and on how to incorporate overall judgment into meta-analyses and review conclusions. This new structure and additional guidance will lead to more robust bias assessment and improve future trial design by highlighting biases that should be avoided. The project will include four stages: (i) Develop new version of the tool with signalling questions and associated guidelines, informed by a meeting with expert methodologists and users of current ROB tool and review of recent empirical evidence for bias; (ii) Pilot - we will host a supported piloting event where reviewers of varied experience will pilot the tool, supported by members of the development team, and provide critical feedback; (iii) Refine the final version of the tool and produce guidance, informed by piloting feedback and reliability analyses; (iv) Implementation and active dissemination of the tool through publication, provision of worked examples, and integration with Cochrane methods and procedures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided for this project.

This has been a notable issue in surgical trials, with preferences for interventions common and a lack of research-active senior surgeons. Recently, several initiatives are changing this. The Royal College of Surgeons have invested in Surgical Trials Centres and Speciality Leads to promote trial participation. Twenty-four surgical Trainee Research Collaboratives (TRCs) have also been established across the UK, which allow trainees to become involved in trials within a large collaborative research group. These TRCs have completed several surgical trials, and have recently spread to anaesthetics. Benefits include improved trial recruitment and a research-active consultant workforce. The reasons for the TRCs' success are unknown but understanding them is key to potential wider translation to other clinical areas. 
Aims: This project aims to 1) identify the key elements leading to successful trials conducted by surgical TRCs and 2) synthesise these findings to develop strategies to enhance clinician engagement in trials across other clinical specialties, including clinician training.
Methods: A qualitative research study to inform a one day trialist stakeholders workshop. The research will include: 1) non-participant observation of TRC-linked surgical trials and TRC meetings, and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews with key clinicians and trials units staff. Trials and linked personnel will be purposefully sampled across three geographical locations to include a variety of surgical specialties, clinicians and TRCs. Meetings and interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis of transcripts will use the constant comparative method.

These decision recommendations are uncertain due to limitations in the available evidence. Value of information calculations measure the expected improvement in our decision recommendations, on the monetary scale, if we reduce (EVSI) or eliminate (EVPPI) uncertainty by gathering further evidence. EVPPI and EVSI can therefore be used to guide research funding decisions, and inform trial design. However, as EVPPI and EVSI involve the expectation of a maximum of a conditional expectation, 2-level nested Monte Carlo simulation and sometimes additional Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation is necessary. This is very computationally intensive and often impractical.
This project aims to assess the potential of efficient sampling techniques to reduce the computational burden of EVPPI and EVSI. Simulations where the decision doesn't change contribute nothing to EVPPI and EVSI. One approach is therefore to use importance sampling and stratified sampling schemes to sample more frequently in the space where decisions change, with appropriate re-weighting. We will develop importance sampling methods for use in the computation of EVPPI and EVSI, and explore their performance on a range of examples. Another approach is to use a method from pricing financial derivatives, such as simple call and put options, which also rely on the estimation a maximum of several processes. We will explore whether numerical techniques developed in this area of mathematical finance, in particular for non-Normal underlying stocks, can be applied to the estimation of the EVPPI and EVSI. We will meet with technical experts in simulation methodology and pricing financial derivatives, to explore how these techniques can be applied to EVPPI and EVSI. We will then apply the methodology to some illustrative examples, and present the work in a focused meeting.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The Network has provided funding for this project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Biostatistics Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>B1(2) - Adaptive designs Outreach Officer continuation</gtr:description><gtr:id>BB98D17F-2D90-4199-B6AA-55404BD6420E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>na</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>One of the primary objectives of the Adaptive Designs Working Group is to increase the successful implementation of adaptive design methodology in clinical trials.

3. The following events arose as a direct outcome of this project:
a. Professor Jenny Donovan applied for a symposium at the Society for Clinical Trials in Boston, USA. Professors Jenny Donovan, Bridget Young, Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain and Dr Nicola Mills gave this symposium on using qualitative research to revolutionize trials on 22 May 2013 to 70 delegates from the USA and Europe.
b. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join the scientific committee of the Clinical Trials Methodology Conference to be held in November 2013 in order to lead a theme on the use of qualitative research with trials. Currently, 22 abstracts have been submitted to the qualitative research theme and abstracts are being selected for oral and poster presentation. 
c. Professor Alicia O'Cathain accepted an invitation to join an MRC funded project writing guidance for undertaking process evaluations with trials. Professor Jenny Donovan accepted an invitation to be an external advisor on this project. 
d. Workshop and symposium members are writing a journal article 'O'Cathain A, Adamson J, Donovan J, Hoddinott P, Jansen Y, Lewin S, Mills N, Moore G, Thomas K, Young B. Guidance on using qualitative research in feasibility studies for randomized controlled trials.' We have approached the editor of the journal Trials who has responded positively to the proposed submission. The first draft was discussed by symposium members and a further draft is underway. Discussions are also underway for an article on developing interventions, led by Professor Pat Hoddinott.
e. Professors Pat Hoddinott and Alicia O'Cathain joined the COnDUCT-II bid to strengthen the qualitative theme. This has been funded to start in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>1. The conference was held on 21 November 2012 in Sheffield with 91 attendees from England, Scotland, Wales, Norway and The Netherlands. 97% of 38 delegates returning the evaluation form said it was an excellent or good day. Their feedback was that they felt that the talks were inspiring and they wanted further events to offer training and discussion.
2. The workshop was held on 22 November in Sheffield with 9 members: Professor Pat Hoddinott (Stirling), Professor Bridget Young (Liverpool, NW Hub), Professor Kate Thomas (Sheffield), Professor Jenny Donovan (Bristol, COnDUCT Hub), Dr Joy Adamson (York), Dr Simon Lewin (Norway), Dr Yvonne Jansen (The Netherlands), Dr Graham Moore (Cardiff) and Professor Alicia O'Cathain (Sheffield). The discussion focused on developing guidance for the use of qualitative research in feasibility studies for trials because the MRC has already funded a group to develop guidance for process evaluations.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding for conference and associated workshop .</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2012-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Glasgow</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Robertson Centre for Biostatistics Glasgow</gtr:department><gtr:description>R40 Use of the electronic health record in the design and conduct of clinical trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>CA91603C-4EB9-414D-AE9C-D61F3A325ADA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>55 delegates from the MRC HTMR, Farr Institute, eHIRC, HeRC and pharmaceutical industry attended the workshop which comprised 4 sessions on the use of electronic databases in supporting trials and a small group session to exchange ideas about methodological research priorities to advance this research area.

1. A survey of UK and Ireland CTUs was undertaken to gather information on how 
they: (i) identify available data sources and assess them for suitability in relation 
to recruitment feasibility assessment; (ii) identify potential patients for studies via 
the electronic patient record and the challenges they experience; (iii) use the EPR 
for outcome data collection and determine the suitability of such data sources.
2. Case studies from the survey were presented at the workshop.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided: This application involves Hubs in the Health Informatics Working Group. The meeting fits

This can provide substantial benefits including increased efficiency and ethics. However they are also more complicated than traditional designs. Thus reporting of trials using an adaptive design is difficult, leading to concerns about interpretability and reproducibility of adaptive trials that may hamper their uptake in practice.
Previous work has identified the need for reporting guidelines for trials using adaptive designs. The CONSORT guidance framework has substantially improved the reporting of randomised controlled trials. However, there is no guidance tailored for the reporting of adaptive trials. This proposal is part of a larger project that will develop and disseminate a CONSORT extension for adaptive trials. 
This proposal will improve the quality and international impact of the developed guidance through three activities. 
The first is a consensus workshop that will bring together around 30 multidisciplinary experts in adaptive trials from around the world. The workshop participants will consist of representatives from academia, industry and regulatory agencies. By including international representatives in person (rather than via telephone), we believe the developed guidance will be of much higher quality and more relevant to a worldwide audience.
The second is a dissemination workshop that will present the guidance to a UK audience. We will invite around 60 individuals that represent a variety of stakeholders including medical journal editors, academic trialists and industry representatives.
The third is to present the guidance at the SCT conference in 2018, which will help disseminate the guidance beyond the UK.
We expect the development of the guidance to raise important gaps in methodology that need to be addressed. Thus, the dissemination workshop will also involve discussions to identify these. In the longer term we hope that this may lead to additional useful methodology research.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Nottingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>R50:Online database for SWAT (Studies Within A Trial) and SWAR (Studies Within A Review) outlines and their data</gtr:description><gtr:id>5FFB68E0-481E-4CC3-89B8-2A77AC3EF97A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>http://www.methodologyhubs.mrc.ac.uk/files/2914/4828/9413/finalreort_R50.pdf

The systematic schema that will be developed and used to categorise the areas of research will allow under researched areas to be identified and targeted for development of grant applications. 
It will also allow collaborations to stem from identification of groups currently working in isolation but with interests in similar areas thereby facilitating cross Hub and external collaborations. This has potential to underpin further grant applications.

The NIHR has provided definitions which are helpful, however, it can be very unclear when to undertake feasibility work, or a pilot RCT and whether an internal or external pilot is the best choice of design. The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian). However, there remains some key unanswered questions in this field. In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event. The combined activities will build on our individual expertise and lead to guidance documents to be published, material to be made available on the web and further meetings with clinical trialists and funding bodies to widely implement the recommendations for when to conduct each type of pilot and/or feasibility study design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>N91 - Health Economics Analysis Plans: developing content guidance through consensus</gtr:description><gtr:id>1F6306D0-4294-4E43-9350-08B17EEE9D70</gtr:id><gtr:impact>na</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Aims

Background
The use of SAPs, drawn up in advance of the analysis phase of a trial, is an accepted means of reducing bias in reporting the results of RCTs. However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance. In October 2015, an HTMR-funded workshop involving fifty (predominantly academic) participants was held to discuss some of the issues associated with HEAPs. Feedback from the workshop suggested that health economists would value guidance and clarity on the appropriate content of a HEAP.

Methods
Building on recent work led by the NW Hub to create guidance for SAPs, we propose to develop a template for a HEAP. We plan to use 'real time' Delphi methodology, which involves presenting dynamic feedback to participants, to gain a consensus opinion on the relevant content of a HEAP. 

A literature review will identify published HEAPs and additional examples will be sought from practising health economists in order to derive a list of items for inclusion in an electronic Delphi survey. A panel of experts will be recruited and, after seeding the survey with responses from randomly selected attendees of the workshop, the survey will be opened to the panel for a period of one month. The project team will convene at the end of the survey to discuss the results with invited participants in a consensus meeting. The final list of items will be developed into a template HEAP, which will be disseminated widely.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University College London (UCL)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit (MRC CTU) at UCL</gtr:department><gtr:description>B1(2) - Adaptive designs Outreach Officer continuation</gtr:description><gtr:id>B4199ED4-954A-4E9B-8913-B99ED4171DC6</gtr:id><gtr:impact>na</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>One of the primary objectives of the Adaptive Designs Working Group is to increase the successful implementation of adaptive design methodology in clinical trials.

The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian).

In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event.

The ultimate aim is to measure the biomarker in clinical practice and use the results to stratify patients, treating them differently depending on the stratum they are in. However, whilst genetic biomarkers with their typically categorical nature lend themselves easily to the idea of stratification, it is not so clear how continuous biomarkers should be used in this way. In addition, before implementing a biomarker to guide treatment in clinical practice, the effectiveness of the biomarker guided approach to treatment must be demonstrated, typically in the form of a biomarker guided trial. However, the design of such trials typically assumes dichotomisation of the biomarker, which loses substantial statistical efficiency. It is unclear how continuous biomarkers should be incorporated and at what stage of the clinical development process the biomarker information should be dichotomised. In this project we propose to review methodologies for determining how to optimally stratify patients using continuous biomarkers, both in the context of a single biomarker and where a panel of biomarkers are predictive, as well as considering at what timepoint during the biomarker's development this decision should be made. The methodologies used in the evidence base for biomarkers already recommended for clinical use will also be investigated. Based on this work we will be able to provide guidance for researchers on the most suitable approach to use. We will also aim to identify gaps in methodology that future work can address.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Network of Hubs for Trials Methodology Research (HTMR)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Health Informatics Working Group</gtr:description><gtr:id>9C153C1F-6C47-4717-98A5-9796BC134699</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Workshop held in 2014.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Scope- The Health Informatics Working Group will undertake methodological and applied research to harness advanced health informatics and electronic health record (EHR) data to improve the design and conduct of trials, and develop capacity in this area. This use of health informatics will also be evaluated to identify the benefit, when compared to current non-EHR approaches. The Working Group will also consider regulatory impacts on the use of bioinformatics (e.g. the interaction of long term follow-up via medical records and the requirements for Information Governance Toolkit certification).
 
Future Objectives- The Working Group aims to establish collaborations with the UK Health Informatics Research Network, and will continue to collaborate with the UKCRC Registered Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) Network; linking methodologists and practitioners to maximise impact.
 
Future research will examine the potential of EHR to;
 
? improve the assessment of feasibility of trial recruitment,
 
? model expected recruitment over the course of a trial, to identify participants for screening via EHR alerts, and
 
? be the primary source of patient outcome and resource use data.
 
We will develop the informatics understanding of how best to collect electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePROs) in trials, both in clinical settings and remotely from patients' homes via web based applications, mobile phones and tablet computers. We will document the added value of ePROs for clinical trials, working where appropriate with industry and regulatory authorities.

Trial validity must be assessed to ensure that synthesised evidence provides a reliable basis for decision-making. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool for assessment of biases in RCTs is widely used for this purpose. It is tailored for assessment of standard parallel-group trials, and only limited guidance is available for more complex designs, e.g. cross-over and cluster trials. We will refine and improve the Cochrane ROB tool for RCTs to bring it in line with recent developments in ROB assessment and expand it to include guidance on cluster and cross-over trials. We will improve the usability and robustness of the tool by adding signalling questions, which guide the assessor to consider all relevant threats to validity within each bias domain. We will provide clearer guidance for reaching an overall outcome- and study-level risk of bias judgement and on how to incorporate overall judgment into meta-analyses and review conclusions. This new structure and additional guidance will lead to more robust bias assessment and improve future trial design by highlighting biases that should be avoided. The project will include four stages: (i) Develop new version of the tool with signalling questions and associated guidelines, informed by a meeting with expert methodologists and users of current ROB tool and review of recent empirical evidence for bias; (ii) Pilot - we will host a supported piloting event where reviewers of varied experience will pilot the tool, supported by members of the development team, and provide critical feedback; (iii) Refine the final version of the tool and produce guidance, informed by piloting feedback and reliability analyses; (iv) Implementation and active dissemination of the tool through publication, provision of worked examples, and integration with Cochrane methods and procedures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided for this project.

However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance, and there is a fundamental question over whether they add value to the trial process at all. In the collective experience of members of the Health Economic Resource Use and Costs Working Group, there is currently substantial variation in the structure, format and content of HEAPs, and no real agreement on either their purpose or appropriate methods of oversight. Clarity on the need for, and appropriate usage of, HEAPs would be advantageous.

We therefore propose to hold a workshop on HEAPs for about 50 attendees in Bristol, with three key aims. First, we plan to review the limited number of currently available guidelines addressing aspects of HEAPs. We also intend to collate information about the current usage of HEAPs in terms of their structure, content and purpose. Finally, we aim to provide a forum in which health economists and other interested parties engaged in applied economic evaluations can open a dialogue on appropriate methods of standardisation with a view to creating guidance in future work.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided.

The NIHR has provided definitions which are helpful, however, it can be very unclear when to undertake feasibility work, or a pilot RCT and whether an internal or external pilot is the best choice of design. The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian). However, there remains some key unanswered questions in this field. In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event. The combined activities will build on our individual expertise and lead to guidance documents to be published, material to be made available on the web and further meetings with clinical trialists and funding bodies to widely implement the recommendations for when to conduct each type of pilot and/or feasibility study design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>North West Hub for Trials Methodology Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>PhD student P16- Using routine data in large multicentre clinical</gtr:description><gtr:id>8439EAFB-BCF2-422B-9B41-26ECB89D756A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing PhD studentship</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The partner is a Hub within the Network and they supervise the PhD student- ref P16</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding of PhD student P16- Using routine data in large multicentre clinical .

Trial validity must be assessed to ensure that synthesised evidence provides a reliable basis for decision-making. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool for assessment of biases in RCTs is widely used for this purpose. It is tailored for assessment of standard parallel-group trials, and only limited guidance is available for more complex designs, e.g. cross-over and cluster trials. We will refine and improve the Cochrane ROB tool for RCTs to bring it in line with recent developments in ROB assessment and expand it to include guidance on cluster and cross-over trials. We will improve the usability and robustness of the tool by adding signalling questions, which guide the assessor to consider all relevant threats to validity within each bias domain. We will provide clearer guidance for reaching an overall outcome- and study-level risk of bias judgement and on how to incorporate overall judgment into meta-analyses and review conclusions. This new structure and additional guidance will lead to more robust bias assessment and improve future trial design by highlighting biases that should be avoided. The project will include four stages: (i) Develop new version of the tool with signalling questions and associated guidelines, informed by a meeting with expert methodologists and users of current ROB tool and review of recent empirical evidence for bias; (ii) Pilot - we will host a supported piloting event where reviewers of varied experience will pilot the tool, supported by members of the development team, and provide critical feedback; (iii) Refine the final version of the tool and produce guidance, informed by piloting feedback and reliability analyses; (iv) Implementation and active dissemination of the tool through publication, provision of worked examples, and integration with Cochrane methods and procedures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided for this project.

Methods: Instruments currently lodged in DIRUM (the Database of Instruments for Resource-Use Measurement, www.dirum.org), and additional instruments sourced from health economists, will be examined to determine the items of resource use that are commonly collected in RCTs. A comprehensive list of care items encountered will be compiled; items will then be categorised into 'domains' describing different types of healthcare (e.g. inpatient care, community care or medication). The item list will be systematically reduced to 10-20 key items per domain to form the basis for the Delphi survey. 

A Delphi panel comprising patients, health economists and trialists from varying backgrounds will be engaged. In round 1 of the Delphi process, professional participants will be asked to rate the items according to their economic importance in a trial context, while patients will be asked to assign ratings based on the item's relevance. Participants will also be asked to suggest additional items of healthcare resource use for consideration. 

Items deemed insufficiently important according to predefined criteria encompassing both professional and patient responses will be dropped. A second Delphi round will be undertaken in which feedback from the first round will be presented to participants. A third Delphi round may be conducted if significant differences of opinion remain.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding- for project- detailed below</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Health Technology Assessment Programme (HTA)</gtr:department><gtr:description>Methodological issues in trials funded by NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>C7BACA6B-1F80-4124-8B97-E9614279F602</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This collaboration has enabled the HTMR Network to prioritise working groups to address methodological issues.

In the 2013 World Health Report, there was an unequivocal statement that unless low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) become the generators and not the recipients of research data, there will never be any real improvements in public health outcomes in these most underserved regions of the world. This lack of data is the result of too few studies being conducted in low-income settings. Therefore undertaking methodology research is required to identify the gaps and issues in order to optimise design, ease and quality with the aim of making research relevant and accessible to health care workers in these regions.
The MRC HTMR Network has established a portfolio of methodology research of relevance to the UK trials community. It is important, and timely, to establish the relevance of this work to LMIC settings, but also to identify gaps where further research would benefit clinical trials in LMICs. The aim of this project is to identify trials methodology research priorities in LMICs. We predict each region can gain valuable lessons from the other.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network has provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bristol</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>N87 - Advancing the integration of mixed methods in clinical trials: a two day summit</gtr:description><gtr:id>63A8B7FB-4AAA-4012-A76E-677607BB7646</gtr:id><gtr:impact>na</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Up to twenty experts in mixed methods and clinical trials will attend a two day summit on the integration of qualitative and quantitative methods in RCTs.

This has been a notable issue in surgical trials, with preferences for interventions common and a lack of research-active senior surgeons. Recently, several initiatives are changing this. The Royal College of Surgeons have invested in Surgical Trials Centres and Speciality Leads to promote trial participation. Twenty-four surgical Trainee Research Collaboratives (TRCs) have also been established across the UK, which allow trainees to become involved in trials within a large collaborative research group. These TRCs have completed several surgical trials, and have recently spread to anaesthetics. Benefits include improved trial recruitment and a research-active consultant workforce. The reasons for the TRCs' success are unknown but understanding them is key to potential wider translation to other clinical areas. 
Aims: This project aims to 1) identify the key elements leading to successful trials conducted by surgical TRCs and 2) synthesise these findings to develop strategies to enhance clinician engagement in trials across other clinical specialties, including clinician training.
Methods: A qualitative research study to inform a one day trialist stakeholders workshop. The research will include: 1) non-participant observation of TRC-linked surgical trials and TRC meetings, and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews with key clinicians and trials units staff. Trials and linked personnel will be purposefully sampled across three geographical locations to include a variety of surgical specialties, clinicians and TRCs. Meetings and interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis of transcripts will use the constant comparative method. 
Outputs: Results will be synthesised and reviewed by co-applicants. These will inform a meeting with key trialists and clinical stakeholders to develop strategies to enhance clinicians' engagement in trials which could subsequently be tested in other specialties and inform post-graduate clinician training.

This use of health informatics will also be evaluated to identify the benefit, when compared to current non-EHR approaches. The Working Group will also consider regulatory impacts on the use of bioinformatics (e.g. the interaction of long term follow-up via medical records and the requirements for Information Governance Toolkit certification).
 
Future Objectives- The Working Group aims to establish collaborations with the UK Health Informatics Research Network, and will continue to collaborate with the UKCRC Registered Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) Network; linking methodologists and practitioners to maximise impact.
 
Future research will examine the potential of EHR to;
 
? improve the assessment of feasibility of trial recruitment,
 
? model expected recruitment over the course of a trial, to identify participants for screening via EHR alerts, and
 
? be the primary source of patient outcome and resource use data.
 
We will develop the informatics understanding of how best to collect electronic Patient-Reported Outcomes (ePROs) in trials, both in clinical settings and remotely from patients' homes via web based applications, mobile phones and tablet computers. We will document the added value of ePROs for clinical trials, working where appropriate with industry and regulatory authorities. Working with others, we will establish good practice for sharing of individual participant data from trials.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>The HTMR Network supports the Health Informatics Working Group (WG) to regularly meet and exchange ideas.

Methods: Instruments currently lodged in DIRUM (the Database of Instruments for Resource-Use Measurement, www.dirum.org), and additional instruments sourced from health economists, will be examined to determine the items of resource use that are commonly collected in RCTs. A comprehensive list of care items encountered will be compiled; items will then be categorised into 'domains' describing different types of healthcare (e.g. inpatient care, community care or medication). The item list will be systematically reduced to 10-20 key items per domain to form the basis for the Delphi survey. 

A Delphi panel comprising patients, health economists and trialists from varying backgrounds will be engaged. In round 1 of the Delphi process, professional participants will be asked to rate the items according to their economic importance in a trial context, while patients will be asked to assign ratings based on the item's relevance. Participants will also be asked to suggest additional items of healthcare resource use for consideration. 

Items deemed insufficiently important according to predefined criteria encompassing both professional and patient responses will be dropped. A second Delphi round will be undertaken in which feedback from the first round will be presented to participants. A third Delphi round may be conducted if significant differences of opinion remain.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding- for project- detailed below</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Medicine, Ethics, Society &amp; History (MESH)</gtr:department><gtr:description>R42: CONNECT study: guidelines to inform consent methods in paediatric emergency medicine and urgent care trials</gtr:description><gtr:id>DA6686FB-B85C-4656-9362-7B2C421B2CD5</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Guidance produced which should impact on research consent

To identify the key content and develop a template for health economic analysis plans that will guide analysts in conducting economic evaluations alongside randomised controlled trials (RCTs).

Background
The use of SAPs, drawn up in advance of the analysis phase of a trial, is an accepted means of reducing bias in reporting the results of RCTs. However, while health economic analysis plans (HEAPs) to guide trialists in conducting economic evaluations alongside RCTs are becoming more widespread, they lag behind SAPs in terms of standardisation and acceptance. In October 2015, an HTMR-funded workshop involving fifty (predominantly academic) participants was held to discuss some of the issues associated with HEAPs. Feedback from the workshop suggested that health economists would value guidance and clarity on the appropriate content of a HEAP.

Methods
Building on recent work led by the NW Hub to create guidance for SAPs, we propose to develop a template for a HEAP. We plan to use 'real time' Delphi methodology, which involves presenting dynamic feedback to participants, to gain a consensus opinion on the relevant content of a HEAP. 

A literature review will identify published HEAPs and additional examples will be sought from practising health economists in order to derive a list of items for inclusion in an electronic Delphi survey. A panel of experts will be recruited and, after seeding the survey with responses from randomly selected attendees of the workshop, the survey will be opened to the panel for a period of one month. The project team will convene at the end of the survey to discuss the results with invited participants in a consensus meeting. The final list of items will be developed into a template HEAP, which will be disseminated widely.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2017-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Liverpool</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>R47: Selective reporting in clinical trials: a feasibility study for examining discrepancies between trial protocols and trial reports submitted to journals</gtr:description><gtr:id>7CF82711-DDFC-40DC-A207-B7E644C3BF55</gtr:id><gtr:impact>27105712</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Collaborators will be working on research to review manuscripts compared against protocols of clinical trials submitted to journals, with feasibility assessed in this initial study involving the BMJ.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding for project</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Medical Research Council (MRC)</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>MRC Clinical Trials Unit</gtr:department><gtr:description>B1- Big Idea- Adaptive Design Outreach officer</gtr:description><gtr:id>68A60F9B-79D4-45B5-94CF-82EB6C6AAA24</gtr:id><gtr:impact>ongoing</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>This proposal is for an &amp;quot;Adaptive Design Outreach Officer&amp;quot; who would be associated with the Adaptive Designs Working Group (ADWG).

The NIHR has provided definitions which are helpful, however, it can be very unclear when to undertake feasibility work, or a pilot RCT and whether an internal or external pilot is the best choice of design. The confusion means that many pilot and feasibility studies are poorly designed, conducted, and reported and terminology remains inconsistent. In recent years there have been several initiatives in these areas, including a workshop on internal pilot studies funded by the HTMR in 2014 (Avery, Blazeby/Williamson), a programme of work on the definition and reporting of external pilot and feasibility studies including development of a CONSORT extension guideline (Eldridge/Thabane/Lancaster/Campbell/Hopewell/Coleman/Bond), and qualitative research in pilot and feasibility studies (Hoddinott/O'Cathian). However, there remains some key unanswered questions in this field. In particular, there has been no work focusing on when researchers should use internal or external randomised pilot study design, and when qualitative research or non-randomised work is required before a main trial. Also, for studies with an internal pilot phase little is known about the selection and reporting of key progression criteria and this is critical to determine main trial success and funding. 
We plan a piece of literature work (analyses of NIHR HTA funded main trials with an internal pilot study to explore their decision making in relation to progression criteria) and a two-day event. The combined activities will build on our individual expertise and lead to guidance documents to be published, material to be made available on the web and further meetings with clinical trialists and funding bodies to widely implement the recommendations for when to conduct each type of pilot and/or feasibility study design.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network provided funding</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Birmingham</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:department>Midland Hub for Trials Methodology Research</gtr:department><gtr:description>DIRUM</gtr:description><gtr:id>2E807514-8EC1-4C75-9A73-A11B44B1AD93</gtr:id><gtr:impact>publications and presentations at conference including:

? Joanna Thorn presented on &amp;quot;Empirical evidence for the validity and reliability of resource-use measures based on patient recall: a systematic review&amp;quot; at the Annual meeting of the HTMR at Oxford on 4th February 2013.

- Since going live in June 2011, the database has had over 13,000 visits with over a third of these coming from outside the UK. To date, the database now contains 73 resource use measures which have been downloaded over 3700 times.
- Between 2012-14, DIRUM has been a cited in the protocols involved in 8 NIHR HTA funded clinical trials securing grants to the total value of &amp;pound;5.4 million [1]. For example, in the PRACTICE and Cardiff breastfeeding trials, DIRUM will help inform the development of the resource use questionnaires used to study the health economics [2], whereas in the LASER trial, a patient RUM will be developed for inclusion in DIRUM and validated by comparing recorded hospital resource use with reported patient resource use. [3]
- DIRUM is signposted from the NIHR Research Design Service websites as a resource for trial health economists. DIRUM has been cited in at least 32 peer-reviewed publications and is referenced in CTU standard operating procedures and key texts in economic evaluation. [4-6]
- A review of DIRUM instruments has been published in the 2015 PSSRU unit cost manual, which has an estimated number of readers reaching 11,000 and the volumes cited in 65% of English health and social care economic evaluations. [7]
- Several related methodological projects have emerged as a consequence of the DIRUM database. These include the development of a single modular resource use measure (HTMR Ref N57), and the compilation of 90 methodological research papers concerning cost analyses in clinical trials. DIRUM also forms part of a substantive review of methods in trial-based economic evaluation [8].
- DIRUM is cited in a number of proposals submitted to the HTA to help secure funding [e.g. 9,10]</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>DIRUM has expanded from 38 resource use measures to 60. Draft paper in development, expected to be submitted summer 2013

Trial validity must be assessed to ensure that synthesised evidence provides a reliable basis for decision-making. The Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) tool for assessment of biases in RCTs is widely used for this purpose. It is tailored for assessment of standard parallel-group trials, and only limited guidance is available for more complex designs, e.g. cross-over and cluster trials. We will refine and improve the Cochrane ROB tool for RCTs to bring it in line with recent developments in ROB assessment and expand it to include guidance on cluster and cross-over trials. We will improve the usability and robustness of the tool by adding signalling questions, which guide the assessor to consider all relevant threats to validity within each bias domain. We will provide clearer guidance for reaching an overall outcome- and study-level risk of bias judgement and on how to incorporate overall judgment into meta-analyses and review conclusions. This new structure and additional guidance will lead to more robust bias assessment and improve future trial design by highlighting biases that should be avoided. The project will include four stages: (i) Develop new version of the tool with signalling questions and associated guidelines, informed by a meeting with expert methodologists and users of current ROB tool and review of recent empirical evidence for bias; (ii) Pilot - we will host a supported piloting event where reviewers of varied experience will pilot the tool, supported by members of the development team, and provide critical feedback; (iii) Refine the final version of the tool and produce guidance, informed by piloting feedback and reliability analyses; (iv) Implementation and active dissemination of the tool through publication, provision of worked examples, and integration with Cochrane methods and procedures.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Network funding provided for this project.
