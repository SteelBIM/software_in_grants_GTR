&lt;p>The aim of this research is to advance our knowledge about this process of polarisation, its causes, its implications and its links with other aspects of job quality. In particular, the research will produce the first empirical evidence on how job polarisation has changed and interacted with the organisation of firms in the UK.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The analysis will also extend to other EU countries to investigate changes in other aspects of job quality in increasingly polarised labour markets and to explore the implications for government budgets and redistributive policies of the growth of jobs at the two ends of the pay distribution.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, the research will study the implications of the hollowing out of the labour market for wage mobility in the UK, and, in particular, for the chances of the low-pay to progress up the career ladder.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The research will therefore contribute to our understanding of the changing labour markets providing important insights for policies for skills, social mobility, and aimed at improving the quality of jobs and, ultimately, people?s wellbeing. &lt;/p></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research will advance our understanding of causes, features and implications of &amp;quot;job polarisation&amp;quot;, i.e. the growth of low- and high-pay jobs accompanied by the loss of mid-pay jobs. The hollowing out of the labour market has already attracted attention well beyond the walls of academia. The expression the &amp;quot;shrinking middle&amp;quot; has entered the mainstream political discourse in many countries, and the topic has been discussed in the media, including the The Economist (2010), the BBC (Hewitt 2012),The Wall Street Journal (Paletta 2012), CNN (Osterman 2011b), the New York Times (D'Andrea Tyson 2012), the Guardian (Paul Harris 2011) and The Telegraph (Truss 2011). Job quality is one of the targets of the EU employment strategy (European Council 2000), and its policy relevance will increase further as more countries will follow the lead of France and the UK (CMEPSP 2009, ONS 2011) in placing more emphasis on measures of wellbeing broader than GDP alone (OECD 2011). 

The research findings will provide important insights for policies on poverty, social mobility, skills and employment which will be of interest for at least two UK government departments, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (DBIS). The relevance of this area of research for the two departments is testified by the fact that polarisation and its implications are already mentioned in some of their background research papers (DWP 2008, DBIS 2010, Crawford eta l. 2011). 

The most relevant aspects for the DWP will be (i) the study of the impact of polarisation on the cost of in-work benefits, and (ii) the implications of changes in the structure and organisation of firms for employment stability and career progression.

The DBIS will certainly find my research on the effect of polarisation on occupational and wage mobility useful as well as the results on the role played by firms in determining the overall quality of jobs. 

The research will also be of interest to UK non-departmental public bodies such as the Commission for Employment and Skills, which promotes practices to create &amp;quot;more and better jobs&amp;quot;, and the Low Pay Commission, which focuses on the conditions of those at the very bottom of the wage distribution. 

In addition, the research will be of interest to a number of non-governmental organisations which aim at influencing policies on skills, poverty, social mobility and quality of life. These include workers' organisations such as the Trades Union Congress, and foundations such as the New Economics Foundation, The Nuffield Foundation, The Work Foundation and The Joseph Rowntree Foundation.

The focus of the research will not be limited to the UK. New and unique evidence will be produced on the quality of jobs in Europe and on the expected impact of polarisation on fiscal policies across a number of European countries. 

This part of the research will certainly be of interest for the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (EUROFOUND), a European Union body which contributes to the planning and design of better living and working conditions in Europe. 

Finally, given the emphasis on quality of jobs within the &amp;quot;Agenda for new skills and jobs&amp;quot; of the EU &amp;quot;Europe 2020&amp;quot; strategy for &amp;quot;smart, sustainable and inclusive growth&amp;quot; (EU 2012), the proposed research will also be of interest to the European Commission and in particular to the Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-12-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>161853</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Invited participant at round table on pay and productivity organised by the Resolution FOundation in London, 15th October 2015.</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>78D9D163-CCA3-47E1-BD60-8ECAF71E27F9</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Andrea Salvatori was invited to participate to this round table discussion on pay and productivity in the UK during which he engage in a debate with people from government departments, think tanks, charities and research organisations.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation at the IBS 2015 Jobs and Technology conference - a forum between academics and international organisations (World Bank, Eurofound, OECD)</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EF7F23EC-997C-4454-A5FB-74E3523A05EB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Andrea Salvatori presented his work on job polarisation in the UK to an audience of academics and researchers from international organisations.
