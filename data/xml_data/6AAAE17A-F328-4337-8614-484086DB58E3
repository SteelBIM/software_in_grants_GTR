Over the last decade, it has been increasingly recognised that PD is a neuropsychiatric disorder, leading to cognitive dysfunction in addition to motor dysfunction. Cognitive impairments have been detected at an early stage in the disease, making them an important marker for early diagnosis and treatment, and many PD patients go on to develop dementia. However, at present cognitive aspects of the disease are poorly understood, and an accurate prognosis is unlikely. To address this, this work aims to develop computational techniques that can identify and discriminate different groups of PD patients based on the occurrence of both cognitive and motor symptoms. Another problem, which this work also addresses, is the difficulty of performing differential diagnosis between neurodegenerative diseases. These often have overlapping symptoms, meaning that patients can be incorrectly diagnosed and go on to receive inappropriate treatments. For instance, PD can be confused with Alzheimer's, progressive supranuclear palsy, multi-system atrophy and corticobasal degeneration in its early stages. Whilst there is no cure for PD, the development of drugs that halt the progress of the disease is an important area of research. By contributing towards better understanding of the disease and better methods for monitoring disease progress, the proposed research will help address some of the obstacles currently faced by drug development.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The proposed research aims to develop computational tools that perform objective accurate diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases using novel yet inexpensive devices. The proposed work targets three application areas: early diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis, and disease understanding.

Early Diagnosis
Due to poor training in primary care, limited provision of expert secondary care and the complexity of presenting symptoms many sufferers of neurodegenerative diseases currently go undiagnosed or are misdiagnosed. Early diagnosis is important for both disease sufferers and their carers, since it enables treatment of symptoms and allows patients to plan their lives and make informed decisions about future treatment and care. With the development of drugs with the potential to halt the progress of neurodegenerative diseases, early diagnosis is likely to become even more important. Furthermore, the combination of high accuracy, the ability to discriminate between different neurological conditions, and the use of inexpensive devices would make our methods well-suited for use in a screening programme for neurodegenerative diseases.

Monitoring and Prognosis
Monitoring is an important part of managing a patient's treatment. However, it is also important for drug development, where there is a need for accurate and objective methods for characterising symptoms and their severity. Current clinical approaches to monitoring rely on human judgment, and display poor consistency both between clinicians and between patients monitored. Hence, the development of objective accurate computational tools for monitoring would have a considerable impact upon both a patient's existing treatment and the development of new treatments. Related to this is the issue of accurate prognosis, which involves predicting the likely course of a disease based upon current measurements of a patient's symptoms. This is particularly important for PD patients, where currently there is no accurate means of determining whether the disease will lead to dementia, or when this will occur.

Disease Understanding 
In general, the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's are not well understood, and this is an important factor underlying the difficulty of diagnosis, prognosis and drug development. In addition to creating tools to perform diagnosis and prognosis, the proposed research also aims to understand the basis of this decision process, both in terms of cognitive and motor symptoms and, significantly, through reference to its neural basis as captured by neuroimaging data. By sharing this information with the medical community, we aim to improve the ability of medical doctors to perform diagnosis and prognosis, increase understanding of the underlying disease processes, and inform drug development.

Economic Impact
Increased early diagnosis rates could lead to considerable economic savings, particularly from delayed admission to hospitals and care homes. This figure has been estimated at around &amp;pound;6000 per person for sufferers of dementia, a condition that affects 1 in 6 people over the age of 80. With the current rate at which the UK population is aging, by 2030 it is estimated that there will be 6 million people over the age of 80, suggesting savings in the region of &amp;pound;6 billion for dementia alone.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-15</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-06-30</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>89483</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs/><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>We developed a computational approach that takes a cognitive assessment drawing, converts this into a set of numerical features that have a clinical meaning, and then estimates the degree of motor and cognitive impairment being experienced by the subject. The method was trained on a dataset collected from a group of Parkinson's patients and age-matched controls, and is intended to automate the assessment of Parkinson's disease: for example, indicating the staging of the disease, or by measuring the effect of therapeutic intervention. However, the process is not tied to a particular disease, and could be applied to other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's.

The main novelty lies in the use of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. These are a kind of artificial intelligence that can be used to discover models that fit particular data sets. In our case, we used them to find diagnostic models that fit disease data. Their multiobjective aspect means that they are able to look for models that are optimal in more than one way, and in this respect they can be used to explore diagnostic trade-offs. In our case, we used the method to explore diagnostic trade-offs between the ability to predict motor and cognitive aspects of Parkinson's disease, with the intention of informing clinical practice more generally.

Our results show that both motor and cognitive aspects of Parkinson's disease can be predicted from cognitive assessment drawings, suggesting the potential for a direct clinical use of these methods as a diagnostic support tool. The cognitive aspect is particularly significant, since it is difficult to predict clinically whether or not a particular patient will develop cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, our results suggest that certain characteristics of movement (for example, bursts of acceleration) are discriminative of cognitive decline, suggesting the potential for prognosing cognitive characteristics via a motor examination.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We remain in contact with the Leeds clinical group, and continue to look at how this work can guide clinical practice. We have also had discussions with a medical diagnostics company. A more general outcome of the research was our demonstration that multiobjective techniques can be usefully applied to the exploration of diagnostic models of Parkinson's disease. However, there remains much that is unknown about the disease, and an interesting follow-up question is whether this approach can be used to generate a basis for characterising disease progression. An objective basis could potentially replace existing diagnostic scales, which are clinically limited due to their subjectivity. Project funds have supported initial meetings to discuss this research direction, and we hope to develop proposals for follow-on funding.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8B8BA9B3-42A7-434F-A2CD-62D237B8ECCC</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Healthcare</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/3FF5D09E-E617-4C57-B2E7-D82BA27DA59C"><gtr:id>3FF5D09E-E617-4C57-B2E7-D82BA27DA59C</gtr:id><gtr:title>Information Processing in Cells and Tissues</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/85e8491cc5652ffe1d93cf87b0f8bc14"><gtr:id>85e8491cc5652ffe1d93cf87b0f8bc14</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lones M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AAB7E45D-C839-4B46-88D9-EFBC3428B0F7"><gtr:id>AAB7E45D-C839-4B46-88D9-EFBC3428B0F7</gtr:id><gtr:title>A Multi-Objective Approach to Predicting Motor and Cognitive Deficit in Parkinson's Disease Patients</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a"><gtr:id>7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vallejo M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781450343237</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/0BD97F96-AD73-4DBC-B589-0C03527B7100"><gtr:id>0BD97F96-AD73-4DBC-B589-0C03527B7100</gtr:id><gtr:title>Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms to Understand Parkinson's Disease</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a"><gtr:id>7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vallejo M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9F98E3CC-4D45-4DD3-9998-DD9923C2F007"><gtr:id>9F98E3CC-4D45-4DD3-9998-DD9923C2F007</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring diagnostic models of Parkinson's disease with multi-objective regression</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a"><gtr:id>7fad7a852ee6d82f5829d4c592b4432a</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Vallejo M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/M013677/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
