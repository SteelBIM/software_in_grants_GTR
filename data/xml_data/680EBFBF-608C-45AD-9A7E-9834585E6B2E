In recent years, however, the topic of Islam in China has become of greater interest to policy makers and to academics. There is now little doubt of the rising global connectedness of Muslims in China, nor of the changes that are occurring in Islamic religious beliefs and practices across China. Such changes are occurring against a backdrop of great diversity in local histories of transmission, socio-economic factors, language and life-ways. Many of these diverse local religious practices are currently under pressure from the forces of change.

Sounding Islam in China proposes to use the methodologies of aural ethnography in order to map the Islamic soundscapes of contemporary China. The approach is interdisciplinary in nature, but arises out of recent trends in anthropology and ethnomusicology. Aural ethnography indicates a fieldwork-based approach to sound, experience and meaning, which may be applied not only to formally recognised types of musical performance but to any &amp;quot;humanly produced sounds&amp;quot;. This approach impels an emphasis on the insights afforded by embodied, sensorial knowledge. The notion of a soundscape situates this focus within the social environment, assuming that sounds are both produced by, and implicated in the shaping of, social practices, politics, and ideologies.

Chinese researchers, especially those with roots in the communities under study, enjoy greater ease of access to Muslim communities, and possess rich resources of field data and experience, but their access to contemporary trends in research is still relatively limited. For foreign researchers working on Islam in China, fieldwork still presents significant challenges. This project promotes collaboration between Western and Chinese researchers through joint field research, and an international conference. It also plans to disseminate current theoretical approaches to postgraduate students in China through a series of training workshops in the Anthropology of Sound.

Areas of investigation include forms of sounded religious practices, such as the call to prayer, Qur'anic recitation, prayers, sermons, life-cycle and other rituals, and forms of religious expressive culture such as stories or devotional songs. Our focus also encompasses ways of listening, and embodied responses to religious sound and emotion. The project of mapping the pious soundscape takes as its central questions: where are the spaces for the production of Islamic sounds, and how are they being reconfigured in contemporary China? As well as 'live' practices, we are interested in media forms which transmit religious sounds and ideologies, such as DVDs carrying sermons or Qur'anic recitation, home-produced cassettes of zikr, online videos, etc. How are Muslim practices and knowledge being orally transmitted in China today? What can we hear from debates on Muslim identity and faith? Is there evidence of the formation of a Muslim civil society in China?

A key aspect of the project is to disseminate its findings beyond the academy by the establishment of a website within which we will map China's Islamic soundscapes through the presentation of audio-visual material gathered by project participants in the course of fieldwork. The material will be translated and contextualised in a way designed to make it accessible to the wider public. We anticipate that the website will be of particular interest to Muslim communities in the West amongst whom there is growing interest in China's Muslims.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>China's Muslim communities are today increasingly under pressure from the forces of change: both from religious reformist agendas which criticise a wide range of 'traditional' practices as incorrect, not proper Islam, and from the Chinese state which responds to the perceived threat of religious extremism by prohibitions, often enough on the same traditions which are threatened by the reformists. For this reason, we believe that there is an urgent need for grounded, detailed ethnographic research on the contemporary state of Islam in China. It is hoped that these findings will help to counter the stereotypes which dog the perception of Muslims within China, and the sharp polarities through which the relationship between state and religion are typically framed.

The project aims to place original ethnographic information on Chinese Muslim communities in the public domain, using the concept of mapping the Islamic soundscape as the key to the presentation of this information through a multi-media website. There is an urgent need to document a range of practices which are being abandoned under the twin pressures of reformist agendas and state prohibitions. The website provides a site for the documentation and dissemination of information about a range of unique religious practices which are fast transforming or being lost.

This information will be of particular interest to diasporic groups of Muslims from China, as well as to Muslim communities in the West, where there is a distinct and growing interest in this large but marginalised community. Representatives of Muslim charities active in China, and with interests in working in China will be invited to attend the conference, and contribute their own insights to discussions. Interested organisations identified include the Aga Khan Trust for Culture, and the London-based groups: Al Quran Institute, Islamic Circle, and Dawn Foundation. A Qur'an recital given by a leading reciter from China, held at SOAS in 2014, will draw in London-based Muslim audiences.

The project findings will also inform policy makers and third sector groups such as charities or human rights organisations. Representatives from Chatham House and Amnesty International will be invited to attend the conference. Published articles in English, including a special journal issue devoted to Sounding Islam in China, will also inform these sectors. The P.I. will disseminate project research through public lectures, for example at Asia House, the Royal Asiatic society, and University public seminars.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-06-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>34632</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>European CD release (Felmay Records) of music by a leading Uyghur singer, with detailed sleeve notes, designed to promote Uyghur musical traditions to Western audiences, and to highlight the influence of Sufism on the tradition.</gtr:description><gtr:id>86BA22FB-0D45-43B8-A869-44EF8AB5A7B0</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Positive reviews in the world music press, greater awareness of the genre and the artist, leading to increased touring opportunities.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Sanubar Tursun: Arzu</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artefact (including digital)</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.felmay.it/catalogue/item.php?id=10208#.Vh4vvBNViko</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Shanghai Conservatory of Music</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>China, People's Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>Chinese Universities</gtr:description><gtr:id>8237CE11-51E2-4D15-AE21-5B65EDC182F8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference papers, audio and video field recordings published on the Sounding Islam in China project website.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Research paper delivered by partners from Shanghai and Xinjiang, at the Islamic Soundscapes of China conference, held at SOAS, University of London in 2013.

The event was enthusiastically attended by the London Uyghur community and the wider public.

Prior to 2014, there was a marked reluctance among Uyghurs to critique new forms of Islam within Uyghur communities, due to a general sense that Islam was an essential tool of resistance against Chinese assimilationist policies in Xinjiang. The debates surrounding the dissemination of our work on Islam and social media saw the beginning of a new willingness within the diaspora to critique militant ideologies and violent action.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.yumpu.com/xx/document/view/32110199/eqilfon-islam</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014,2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>300000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Research Project</gtr:description><gtr:end>2017-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>26543C58-16F7-4E1A-8C01-F4ACCE23CD53</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The project has engaged with a wide range of beneficiaries from beyond the academy, working with Muslim organisations based in the UK who are interested in Muslims in China.

A central aspect of the project is the website 'Sounding Islam in China' which showcases audio-visual data presented at the January 2014 conference and gathered during the field trips (video/audio recordings of religious oral practices, and religious expressive culture, oral testimonies), together with translations, accessible contextualisation, and discussion by academics. The website is reaching out to the wider public, and especially to Muslim communities in the West. It also serves an archival purpose, preserving an audio-visual record of the diverse religious practices and oral histories of Muslims in China, and mediating this material for English-speaking audiences.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>C1E5D6D4-1D4C-4CC7-8F2A-375967356D13</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Education,Government, Democracy and Justice,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Recent decades have seen the increasing global connectedness of Muslims in China, and rapid changes occurring in Islamic beliefs and practices across this large and diverse country. As yet underrepresented in scholarship, rich traditions in Islamic sounds evoke diversity at the core of identity and faith. This project focuses on sounded ritual practices and forms of religious expressive culture, asking: what do we learn from production, transmission and reception of Islamic sounds? What do they tell us of transnational flows and local continuity? How does sound help understanding global ideological debates and existential piety, personal acquiescence and collective resistance?

The project is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing in scholars working in anthropology, ethnomusicology, religion and folklore. Through an international conference held in January 2014, joint fieldwork in China, training sessions in anthropology of sound in Chinese universities, and a visiting Chinese Quranic reciter hosted at SOAS and Oxford, we are facilitating collaboration between Chinese, American and European scholars and students, sharing methodologies and experience in the field. We have reached out to Muslim communities in the UK, inviting this public to our events, and our project website and social media outreach disseminates our findings more widely.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>A further project, funded by Leverhulme, is already
