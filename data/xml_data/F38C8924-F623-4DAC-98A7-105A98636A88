International research efforts mapped the distribution of these macronutrients in detail and developed a full understanding of how these macronutrients are chemically cycled into, out-of, and within the oceans. Models of ocean biology and the global carbon cycle now incorporate this understanding. In the early 1990s, however, it became clear that this view of ocean nutrients was incomplete. New ability to sample seawater without contaminating it, and to make sensitive measurements, demonstrated that a range of metals, present at low concentrations in seawater, were required by life. Of these 'micronutrients', the most prominent is iron which is now known to be the major limitation on life in large areas of the ocean. Other micronutrients, such as zinc and cobalt, are also essential for critical biological processes. Despite their importance, our knowledge of the chemical cycle of these micronutrients is rudimentary, particularly compared to that of the macronutrients. We know micronutrients enter the ocean in dust, but the size of other inputs (from rivers, alteration of sediments, or from undersea volcanoes) is not known. Even the distribution of these micronutrients in the ocean is poorly known and measurements are sparse, particularly in the deep ocean. To understand controls on life and the carbon cycle in the ocean, there is an urgent need to dramatically improve knowledge of the distribution and cycling of micronutrients. This is the goal of a major new international research programme - GEOTRACES. The programme seeks to develop an understanding of micronutrient cycles as comprehensive as that of the macronutrients, through a series of sections spanning all the ocean basins. This proposal represent the UK contribution to that programme. We will map the concentration of the seven most important micronutrients through the full water column along an east-west section at 40oS in the Atlantic. This ocean is little studied but is an important region for ocean biogeochemical cycles. In the surface at this latitude the ocean is very productive, requiring addition of micronutrients, but the source of these micronutrients is not known. At depth are found three different water masses. The uppermost flows northwards and upwells to the surface at the equator to provide micronutrients to this very productive region, while the middle layer flows southward before upwelling in the Southern Ocean where low iron supply is known to be the primary limitation on life. Understanding micronutrient inputs to these deep water masses is therefore important for life in a much broader region, and will teach us generally about the processes that control cycling of micronutrients into surface and deep waters around the globe. We will study the inputs of micronutrients from four ocean boundaries - from the atmosphere as dust blown from South America; from rivers (the large Plata River); from sediments; and from the active volcanoes found in the mid Atlantic. We will use a variety of tools - including other chemicals that act as tracers of the micronutrients, and computer models - to assess how micronutrients get from their sources into the open ocean. And we will study the relationship between these micronutrients and the nature of the ecosystems that occur in the productive seas of 40oS. This work will rely on co-operation between 10 leading UK institutes, including universities and research centres, and also involves leading scientists from other countries (partially through the GEOTRACES programme). This national and international effort will lead to a significant improvement in our understanding of the cycles of the metals that control the biology and carbon system in the ocean.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-04</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2010-05-05</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>252466</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to World Meteorological Organization Annual Congress</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BB8E770D-46D8-48C6-B2A8-77C9FA2A2143</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Science Officers from WMO member states attended the event, which highlighted the impact of atmospheric aerosols on climate and the wider Earth System.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Policymakers/politicians</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Data gathered as part of this project has been used to help communicate to policy makers the importance of atmospheric inputs to the oceans for marine carbon cycle and global climate.

Some of these nutrients, such as iron, cobalt and zinc, are found in very tiny amounts in seawater and in some cases the growth of the tiny marine plants (phytoplankton) that depend on them can be limited by this. This is particularly true in the remote South Atlantic, where sources of dust and other aerosols from the nearby land (South America and southern Africa) are rather small.
This project aimed to find out more about the atmospheric supply of iron and other metals and nutrients to the southern South Atlantic Ocean by collecting rainwater and aerosol samples from ships and by establishing an atmospheric sampling site on a remote island in the Falklands.
We successfully collected samples during two cruises in the South Atlantic and operated our sampling site on Carcass Island in the Falklands for two ~8 month long periods in 2010-11 and 2011-12. The concentrations of iron and other substances were much lower than in remote areas of the northern hemisphere, almost certainly because there is less land and fewer people (and therefore less pollution) in the southern hemisphere. We have been able to publish one manuscript based directly on our work on the cruises we participated in the eastern South Atlantic (Chance et al., 2015) and were also able to conduct a complimentary study in the eastern South Pacific (Baker et al., 2016). Our efforts to quantify the impact of these low concentrations on the South Atlantic are still underway, with a further manuscript currently under review (Jickells et al., Phil. Trans. A, submitted) and another (describing our work in the western South Atlantic) in preparation.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our results from this project contribute to the on-going international GEOTRACES programme, which aims to evaluate the impact of trace elements on the marine carbon cycle and Earth System.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>B81CFB07-3EC2-4CB8-B303-2467F1D29B19</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/428A15DD-528C-4C2F-9B88-C9BE83A8A8AB"><gtr:id>428A15DD-528C-4C2F-9B88-C9BE83A8A8AB</gtr:id><gtr:title>Atmospheric trace metal concentrations, solubility and deposition fluxes in remote marine air over the south-east Atlantic</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Marine Chemistry</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/a6a0295fdba2f32d824e8c33e07d9b65"><gtr:id>a6a0295fdba2f32d824e8c33e07d9b65</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Chance R</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/33A01C76-17AB-4AF8-AA42-98EC0D0C8AEF"><gtr:id>33A01C76-17AB-4AF8-AA42-98EC0D0C8AEF</gtr:id><gtr:title>Trace element and isotope deposition across the air-sea interface: progress and research needs</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical,
