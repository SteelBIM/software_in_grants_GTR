Our GOAL is to develop robust evidence on green growth in both EU and Chinese cities and to draw lessons to facilitate a transition towards sustainable development in EU and Chinese cities. Our team has brought strong and multi-disciplinary expertise into this project from aspects of urban development, environmental economics, economy-energy-environmental modelling, carbon accounting and policy analysis for technology transfers. 
Green growth means shifting to a development model where environmental protection and economic growth complement each other, rather than being contradictory. Generating 85% of Europe's GDP, 80% of energy consumption and 75% of carbon emissions, cities have a central role to play in this process. European cities are striving for green growth. They are adapting local regulation and raising citizen awareness. Recently, the EU has launched the Europe 2020 strategy that sets out sustainable growth as one of its priorities, alongside smart and inclusive growth: 'making our production more resource efficient while boosting our competitiveness' . On the other hand, China will play a pivotal role in the fight against climate change given due to its immense size and need to develop. Shifting Chinese cities to a green growth path is a critical part of the fight. Chinese cities home 46% of the population and contribute 75% of the Chinese national economy and nearly 85% of CO2 emissions. The nexus between urban evolution and emission mitigation is the key in China's green growth. While the green-growth debate is becoming more prominent at the international level, understanding how to operationalise green-growth strategies is still lacking at more local levels. The key challenges remain: 
Challenge 1: What are the dynamics of emission trends in Chinese cities at different urbanisation and industrialisation stages? Energy and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission inventories are usually built at national level. But no such international framework exists requiring measurements of city emissions or providing detailed methodological guidance for conducting an urban emissions inventory. We will construct city level emission inventories. 
Challenge 2: What factors are driving emission growth in cities? Quantification of emission driving forces has been extensively studies at the national level. Few studies have found at the city level. Understanding the key factors in driving the emission growth, one can target the problem more specific to reduce emissions in cities. 
Challenge 3: What are the sources of green growth in cities and how can we support green growth? Green growth can open up new sources of growth through increasing resource efficiencies and economic productivities, supporting technology innovations, creation of new market, boosting business confidence in green growth and enhance economic stability. Institutional arrangements and economic incentives are the key to sustain the sources of growth in cities. New institutional arrangements will need to be established to guide the development of green growth strategies and to overcome the institutional inertia and silos that exist around economic and environmental policy making.
Challenge 4: How to use interventions to transform cities to green growth? Cities are the centre of transitioning towards green economy. Green growth is already underway in both European and Chinese cities. We identify available interventions for green growth and examine the effectiveness of those interventions.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our GOAL in this research programme is to develop robust evidence on the scope for, the routes to and the potential limits of green growth strategies in both EU and Chinese cities, and to draw lessons and promote learning to facilitate a transition towards low carbon development in EU and Chinese cities. To secure relevance and enhance impact, the research programme will engage with key stakeholders from different levels (international, national, regional, local) and sectors (public, private and civic) at all stages in the lifecycle of the research. Our engagement, communications and impact strategies will be directly informed by 1) those of the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, a recent evaluation of which concluded that its performance in this area was outstanding; 2) Centre of Energy and Environment Policy Research, an excellent research powerhouse in the subject of sustainable development in China: 3) Sino-German programme on Low carbon city future led by Wuppertal Institute and advised by a global stakeholder committee; and 4) CIRED - an outstanding research think-tank in assisting environmental policy design and advise policy decision making in France and international organisation such as World Bank, OCED and UN. 

To ensure maximum profile and impact, we will then structure our activities through three tiers of engagement. For those stakeholders that can become active partners in the research programme (tier 1 partners), we will develop close, formalised, sustained modes of engagement on programme steering committees. These partners will be involved in the meaningful co-production of knowledge, for example by helping us to refine and focus the research objectives, review and select appropriate cases, data sources and methods, review preliminary research findings and draw out the implications and aid the communication of these to different communities of policy and practice. For those stakeholders that have a clear interest in and are engaged in work that is directly relevant to the programme (tier 2 partners), we will develop an engagement plan that seeks to promote active dialogue on the programme, and that invites them to relevant events and workshops and that offers opportunities to engage in the research programme more directly if they want to. For those stakeholders with a broader interest in the findings of the programme, including the media, (tier 3 partners), we will develop clear lines of two-way communication to both inform them about and to hear their comments on the key research findings. 

To implement our plan, we will develop bespoke engagement, communication and impact plans for each participating country (China, Germany, France, UK). We employ two dedicated impact ambassadors from both EU (Chu Xia, WI) and Chinese sides (Huanan Li, BIT) to coordinate such processes with support from project investigators and clerical administrator. 

Our engagement and impact plans will be based on our already close working relationships with many of the actors and networks at different levels and different sectors. At the international level, members of the consortium already work closely with agencies such as the UN, the OECD, the World Bank, the IFC, ICLEI, the Global Green Growth Institute, The Climate and Development Knowledge Network, the C40 and R20 networks on issues relating to green growth in cities. At the national levels, in each participating country, we have close links with key government departments and development agencies, as well as with relevant private sector partners from related industries and with key NGOs and pressure groups. And at the local level, particularly in the case study cities in each of the participating countries, we have close links with city leaders and local government networks, with economic development agencies, with private sector consultants and service providers and with NGOs and community groups.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2018-02-28</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>397418</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs/><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The Dragon project results have already made international impact in the field of climate change. The WP1 aims for developing robust and transparent carbon emission accountings for China and its regions. One of Dragon publications in Nature, entitled of &amp;quot;Reduced carbon emission estimates from fossil fuel combustion and cement production in China&amp;quot;, have received great public and policy attention. It has been media reports by over 200 outlets worldwide in different languages. IPCC and global climate change community have been advocated emission data accuracy and transparencies. The Paris Adoption (so called Paris Agreement for Climate Change) formally wrote in the Article 4.1 as &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Parties shall account for their nationally determined contributions. In accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals corresponding to their nationally determined contributions, Parties shall promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting, in accordance with guidance adopted by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement&amp;quot;. 

Secondly, research on green cities (WP3 and 4) has been conducted that joins together research that has been supported by the ESRC Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy with new research that is emerging as part of the EU-China DRAGON Project on the dynamics of green growth in cities in the EU and China. Supported by CCCEP, the research focused initially on the city of Bristol in the UK where it analysed the energy use and carbon emissions and options for low carbon development in the city. The research report was launched at the international climate talks in Paris in December 2015, and it has underpinned the development of a new low carbon development strategy for the city of Bristol. Supported by the DRAGON Project, the research is now being extended to consider the embedded energy and carbon emissions associated with consumption in the city of Bristol. The research finds that including these embedded emissions in the analysis trebles the size of the carbon footprint of the city. It also highlights some major carbon reduction opportunities that have thus far been invisible and it suggests that cities may find much more carbon and potentially also cost effective opportunities for carbon reduction than those that are commonly recognised. In the coming months, the research will be extended to other cities in the UK, and used as the basis for a study that compares UK and Chinese cities. 

DRAGON project results are frequently cited by influential stakeholders. For example, results published in Nature 2015 was used as evident by the IPCC AR5 WGIII Co-Chair, Professor Ottmar Edenhofer in his 2016 PNAS paper (Drivers for the renaissance of coal), to investigate the constraints of global coal peak. The quote is &amp;quot;In this respect, most recent data from China implying that emission and coal use have decreased in 2014 (8) might be seen as a ray of hope In the past, statistics of Chinese coal consumption have been subject to large adjustments after their initial publication.&amp;quot;

Lord Nicolas Stern used our results in his paper (China's changing economy: implications for carbon dioxide emissions) to discuss the time and level of global / China carbon peak. The quote is: &amp;quot;When combined with recent improvements in understanding baseline historical data (e.g. Liu et al., 2015), our analysis of recent data and likely trends could help to inform new models and modelling assumptions that yield a much more realistic range&amp;quot; 

Our research have received attention and adopted by Chinese authority - National Development and Reform Commission. As a result, China submitted the First Biennial Update Report on Climate Change&amp;quot; to the united nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC). China publishes its official greenhouse gases (GHG) emission inventory of 2012 in the report. There is only a 2.87% gap between the official emissions and DRAGON research, which is within the 5% statistical difference.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>3C28C3AA-8A52-4033-8C51-32A9476AEEC6</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment,Government, Democracy and Justice</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>1. The research contribute to the knowledge in terms of emission accounting methodology. For the first time, fuel quality is taken into consideration in compiling emission inventories. The results shows that China burn low quality coal and the resulted emission is 9% - 14% smaller than many international agencies estimates. 

2. Chinese cities are at different development stage. They have capacity and constraints in achieving emission reduction. Cities can be categories by different types in terms of the industrialization stages. For energy production and heavy industry type cities, they many focus on efficiency improvements, while light industry and hi-tech manufacturing cities can focus on switching fuel types and upgrade their production structures.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We have set up an data website - China Emission Accounts and Datasets - http://www.ceads.net. The website provides most up-to-date energy, emission and socioeconomic accounting inventories for China, at national, provincial and city level. We publish the dataset for free download for any academic / public purpose. There are currently 1000+ users registered on the website and made 10k+ downloads. 

Transparency and accuracy together with completeness, consistency, and comparability is written into the Paris Agreement under Article 4.1. The most recent achievement is that our emission accounts and results are adopted by Chinese authority in the latest Chinese official emission amendment accounts which was submitted to United Nation in Jan 2017.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>7ECA77DB-1A2E-4B24-8E15-82BFA02C8BB0</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Energy,Environment</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Research results used by China's First Biennial Update Report on Climate Change submitted to UNFCCC</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Multiple continents/international</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>08D3E0FC-E4EF-4FBF-A368-AD5DA739401E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>China submitted the First Biennial Update Report on Climate Change&amp;quot; to the united nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC).
