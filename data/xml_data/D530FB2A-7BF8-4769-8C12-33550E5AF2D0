Peace</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008149/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>With the launch of the Coalition's plans to mark the centenary of the Great War, the Communities Secretary observed: 'As the First World War moves out of common memory into history, we're determined to make sure these memories are retained', but which common memories did he have in mind? Remembering, just like forgetting, is always a political act. The war was a global conflict which left its mark on the local. Was it experienced differently in urban and rural areas? What were the relationships between soldiers and civilians during and after the war? Did it shape individual and community identities? Did it have different meanings for contemporaries? There was a consensus that the dead were to be commemorated and remembered, but there was less agreement over how the example of sacrifice was to be understood and the meanings to be attributed to and experiences to be drawn from acts of commemoration. How have these meanings changed over time? How will it be understood today? Is it a truism that 'the past is a foreign country: they do things differently there'? Certainly, Britain today is a very different country to that of 1914 and has been described by Parekh (2000) as 'a community of communities.' What sense will young people make of the local memorials to the dead which sit in the urban and rural landscapes and the acts of commemoration organised by an older generation which will centre upon them? What meaning will the war have for young people who have grown up in a society where live reports of conflict are readily available on a smartphone and where the return of the dead from Afghanistan is instantly reported in the media? How will they connect the past with their present and their future? As the First World War moves out of memory into history, what will be the record of commemoration they will have experienced that will be left after 2018 for future historians to reflect upon? These are just some of the questions which have been generated by reflecting on the joint Arts and Humanities Research Council/Heritage Lottery Fund commemorative project. These reflections have in turn shaped the 'Voices of War and Peace: the Great War and its Legacy' project proposal. 

At the core of this cross disciplinary project is an institutional commitment to community engagement with research and a professional commitment 'in a mission of understanding' to investigate, analyse, apprehend, criticize and judge and thereby translate Edward Said's idea of 'communities of interpretation' into practice (Said 2003). Using Birmingham, the UK's second city, as its primary place of memory, the project will reach out to multiple communities/publics both local and national to explore through dialogue issues around memory, remembering and commemoration. The research network will respond to community requests for support in terms of capacity building and support community driven research agenda. Working with other funded centres and the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement (NCCPE) the project will invest in developing the community engagement experience of early career researchers. A strength of the network beyond its relevant knowledge expertise is the experience embedded within its membership of effective partnership working. As an internationally engaged network, it will seek out relations with cultural institutions in Birmingham's sister cities and through the Universitas 21 network to understand other national and local processes of commemoration and thereby further illuminate our understanding of memorial activities in the UK. Sharing knowledge, expertise and resources, it is intended that the project will leave its own legacy for community/academy relations in terms of the capacity for the co-design and co-production of research, an understanding of the complicated relationship between remembering and forgetting and a desire to continue to 'think forward through the past'.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Many groups can be identified that will benefit from the Voices of War and Peace project. The most direct beneficiaries will be the partner organisations who have agreed to collaborate and whose letters of support are included with this application. These organisations will benefit from their staff being involved in working across the academy/cultural sector divide and gaining insights into the research culture to be found in the university sector. None of the partners currently have the capacity to be identified as independent research organisations but involvement in the project will support the development of a research culture especially through the engagement of those participants in the University Cultural Partnership Honorary Research Fellow and Associate scheme. In particular this will impact on the Library of Birmingham and Birmingham Museums Trust and their ambition to move towards possible Independent Research Organisation status. 

Partner organisations will also have gained increased understanding of the needs, interests and knowledge of communities be they local, regional or virtual and also insights into the community research agendas of the National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement [NCCPE] and the AHRC. 

A second, but as yet difficult to quantify, group of benificiaries will be the various communities who will have engaged in dialogue with the researchers in the network and in collaborative research. At the heart of the AHRC/HLF/NCCPE initiative around the commemoration of the First World War is a capacity building agenda. Active engagement in researching community heritage projects will have been supported by the research network through the provision of workshops which will mean that individuals can gain skills relevant to ensuring that heritage is better looked after, managed, understood and shared including, among others, conservation, digital and project management skills. Relationships are at the core of the quality of life in geographically defined communities and active engagement in participatory and inclusive community heritage projects can strengthen the resilience of communities and the sense of belonging. The dialogue between communities and researchers around the commemoration of the First World War will have focused on sensitive issues around what is remembered and what is forgotten and will have drawn attention to different interpretations of the past. The ideas of 'community' and 'collective memory' are embedded in these interpretations and reflecting on how the past is made accessible in the present will have the potential to enable individuals and communities to understand how they are positioned in relation to the past.

A third group of beneficiaries will be those members of the research network, including Early Career Researchers, who have little or no experience of working with communities on heritage related projects as the Centre will organise training and workshops on undertaking public engagement.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>596228</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>'Voices of War' is an exhibition based on the important archives relating to the First World War held by the city of Birmingham archives.

This exhibition featured three elements of commemoration of young people and families affected by World War 1, using the medium of ceramic plates, flowers and models.

The first part of the exhibition featured work in progress from a project working with young people in the Staffordshire area, which explored memory and commemoration in relation to the North Staffordshire Regiment and the experiences of underage soldiers in the First World War.

The second part of the exhibition featured ceramics that commemorate the memories of people from the Manchester/North West area, and looked at the wider issues of all the young people affected by World War 1, from young children left behind or bereaved to young protesters and pacifists who opposed the war.

Finally, the exhibition featured original works by acclaimed ceramicist, project lead and curator of the exhibition, Professor Steve Dixon (MMU), whose work has led the way in re-figuring war commemoration in this medium, in terms of collective memory and public engagement.</gtr:description><gtr:id>908D958E-7E4D-4643-AB7E-770EB3B98DDF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The exhibition was part of the Voices community research fund project, 'The Lost Boys: remembering the boy soldiers of the First World War through ceramics', a collaboration between The Clay Foundation, Staffordshire Museums Consortium and Manchester Metropolitan University.

Each project by Clapham Film Unit has reached out into the community. We have worked with a wide range of people from refugees, older people, young people, graffiti artists and peace activists. We believe film is a great way to tell a story. The film for this project will be a scripted recreation of the Women's Peace Crusade using archive material and footage. We will engage members of the community who do not usually engage with heritage to take part in the reenactment. They will spread the finished film through their social media networks enabling us to tell the story to much wider range of people than we would otherwise reach.
There will be a booklet, written by the local researchers, that relates to each town in Lancashire and Greater Manchester and that will be available alongside a touring exhibition about the WPC which will visit each town where the Crusade happened.
Clapham Film Unit believes passionately in engaging academics with the community to ex-change ideas, inspiration and research, to investigate and celebrate lost histories.
Manchester Archives +
Manchester Central Library reopened in March 2014 and has welcomed 1.4 million visitors in its first year. The Archives+ exhibition has proved popular in its first year. For example:

? North West Film Archive and BFI Mediatheque film viewing pods: 8,800 sessions and 37,500 films viewed.
? Postcard interactive (where you can email a friend a historic postcard):
5,840 postcards sent.
? 25% of visitors to Central Library are from outside the North West.
? 90% of young people find Central Library 'young people' friendly.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>This project aims to bring the largely forgotten Women's Peace Crusade back into the histories of the industrial towns of the North West.
Local volunteer researchers will be recruited through Manchester Archives + and the Manchester Centre for Regional History's networks of local history enthusiasts. The volunteers will be trained to use the archives, undertake historical research and to write up the findings.
This project will work with volunteer researchers, in collaboration with Manchester Archives + and the Manchester Centre for Regional History at Manchester Metropolitan University, using local archives, minute books, local directories, and newspapers in order to trace and track local women who were involved in the Crusade in Burnley, Bolton, Oldham, Blackburn, Nelson and Manchester.
Using the new research gathered, this project will
? co-produce a short booklet featuring the stories of the women involved in the Crusades from each of the six towns.
? create a touring exhibition to showcase the research and complement the booklet
? make a scripted documentary that will recreate the local Crusades and will involve local schoolchildren and the research volunteers.
? give talks to the public, local community groups, and schools.
The project will substantially develop the knowledge and skills of both academic and community partners and will have a real and discernible impact on people, heritage and communities in the North West.

Sharing of ideas, expertise, open discussion; Hearing from others about the challenges they have encountered; Networking; Potential future collaborations have emerged; A very useful event. 

Subsequent discussion between two participants, Laura Sambrooks from Central Youth Theatre and David Savill form Age Exchange. 
Email from Laura 23.07.15: David Savill from Age Exchange is also interested in working with us, and Central Youth Theatre would now like to do a theatre project. The subject would still be the same-looking at the struggle to get the soldiers pardoned, with a particular focus John Hipkins and how his experiences as a POW (only aged 14) in the Second World War encouraged him to lead the Shot at Dawn campaign. We're looking at doing reminiscence sessions (helped by Age Exchange) with the young people to learn about the people involved with the SAD campaign and perhaps the experiences of other child POWs. 
As this would now culminate in a theatre piece rather than film, the role of the university would probably be more about the research side of the project.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Work with Wales for Peace on walking tour and The Peace Map</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>2CA13BB3-B99C-4DDB-B140-C912211DE2DB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The walking tour was piloted at the Challenging History conference and 30 delegates were able to complete it.

The Tin Shed in Laugharne houses a WW2 museum and doubles up as a music venue in its pole barn 
out the back. At first it was family and friends who were invited. People that I knew had stories to tell. They were invited to the commemorative performance of Trenchfoot at The Shed. Alongside that we invited people prior to the performance to spend Sunday afternoon at the Shed telling stories of The Great War, whether it be a family story or other. People were encouraged to bring photos, as their stories would be videoed to start a collection that possibly could be then published on a You Tube channel or/and to the Peoples Collection. 
Social media was plastered with posters and requests to come along. It was open to everyone. After getting no help from local or national press for the initiative I was still positive as so many people had agreed to turn up. As a supporter of the band, Trenchfoot, Frank Hennessey advertised the event on his Sunday evening folk programme which pulled in people I didn't know and with the help of local historical societies we were able to engender an interest in the event. 
On the day over 100 people turned up. We were able to record 9 interviews on the afternoon and did another 5 on a separate day for those who couldn't make it on the Sunday. 10 to 15 people were nervous in front of the camera and turned down the offer of telling their story. I did 
think of telling their story for them but it seemed the wrong thing to do and so we concentrated on the people who were relatively happy in front of the camera. While interviews were being recorded in the cottage at the bottom of the garden, performers were being recorded in the museum and throughout the afternoon/evening entertainment was both improvised and planned. Robert John sung WW1 marching songs, The Camel Club gave renditions of wartime songs and Luke Edwards, a virtuoso guitarist arranged wartime songs in a classical finger-picking style. He was joined by a member of the audience for Danny Boy. The early evening event was finished off by a 45 minute set of songs 
from folk band Trenchfoot who gave their usual mix of heart rendering ballads and foot stomping up tempo 
numbers that kept the capacity crowd singing along to original self-penned numbers about the 1914-18 period. In the middle of all this Jaye Swift, independent film producer and script writer from Barry, South Wales allowed us to show her short film, Letters Home, based on soldiers in the trenches, and their thoughts, just before going over the top on July 1st 1916.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Questioning Commemoration: the Home Front in the First World War</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>A54594DB-4A6B-4C66-BA44-4F64D780ED2E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited speaker giving the Tim Curtis Memorial lecture at the University of Central Lancashire to an audience of academics, postgrads, general public including school teachers, community historians and interested local people.

This exhibition featured three elements of commemoration of young people and families affected by World War 1, using the medium of ceramic plates, flowers and models. The first part of the exhibition featured work in progress from a project working with young people in the Staffordshire area, which explored memory and commemoration in relation to the North Staffordshire Regiment and the experiences of underage soldiers in the First World War. The second part of the exhibition featured ceramics that commemorate the memories of people from the Manchester/North West area, and looked at the wider issues of all the young people affected by World War 1, from young children left behind or bereaved to young protesters and pacifists who opposed the war. Finally, the exhibition featured original works by acclaimed ceramicist, project lead and curator of the exhibition, Professor Steve Dixon (MMU), whose work has led the way in re-figuring war commemoration in this medium, in terms of collective memory and public engagement.

On Remembrance Sunday, the exhibition space served as a performance area for a special one off performance by the Honour Choir, during which visitors took part in the silence, and heard the choir's voices raised in contemplative commemoration for lives lost in war.

c. 150-200 visitors saw the exhibition and over 200 brochures were taken. On-line media capture included the following twitter feedback:

Key themes were the nature of government decision making in immature democracies (e.g. Imperial Germany), the economics of total war, coping with social dislocation in Europe (in particular the contrasting experiences of Belgian and Polish refugees) and the influence of the war on the present day Middle East. 
Many of the delegates reported that they felt they had learned more about the First World War in a week of intensive study than they had in their previous academic careers.

The workshop introduced pupils to the ideas and issues surrounding the outbreak of World War One and gave school students a sense of what university teaching and learning involves, in a fun and inter-active way. The emphasis was on students receiving a positive and enjoyable learning experience that would raise their attainment and aspirations. 

The event resulted 50 sign ups to our mailing list, which included, teachers, education practitioners and families. 


93% of pupils said they found the workshop interesting and enjoyable and learnt something they didn't know before. 80% of pupils said they gained skills that would help them to do better in exams and felt more confident about their understanding of WW1. 67% said they felt more motivated to continue in education after finishing high school. 54% said they would consider studying at MMU in the future.

Pupils were asked to analyse propaganda posters from the homefront and to empathise with the families of the soldiers left behind at home. Utilising skills acquired at Key Stage 3 to analyse and produce non-fiction texts, the pupils then had to produce their own propaganda posters / speeches and letters. The workshop was led by two hIstory undergraduate students who have apassion for their subject and would like to teach it in schools. Both students have successfully got onto a PGCE for History and will commence training in the Autumn of 2016

100% of pupils said they learnt something they didn't know previously. 100% said they had learnt skills which would help them to do better in their History exams and coursework. 100% said they felt more confident with History after the workshop. 65% of pupils said that they would consider studying at MMU in the future. 

Comments: 

I learned techniques used in propaganda posters to convince people to do things, for example, imperatives, alliteration and emotive language I learned about propaganda and the techniques that are used to make it. For example: imperative commands I learnt how to share my ideas in the group and then combine our ideas together; Very well organised
Good activities that kept me interested
I thought it was wonderful and all the people are very helpful
I enjoyed working in groups and doing something different
&amp;quot;I learnt about the different ways posters were used during the war to bring out emotion.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Visitor Work</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B094B649-1966-4990-8219-9290ADF2A736</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A large quantity of qualitative data was gathered on people's responses to the travelling poppy exhibition at Woodhorn Museum.

Project aims: 
To engage students with the commemoration of WW1 through the 100 year old stories of their classmates; 
To explore the archive and unearth interesting stories from 1914-1918 that demonstrate 
how the students responded to the war; 
To explore the wider context at the time and how, for most students, life continued despite the wider context of war; 
To bring together creative responses to the war where these were produced; poems, art, cartoons, music, literature etc. These might be useful subject matter for the documentary; 
To scan all of the relevant materials so that these can be used to compile a number of project outcomes 

The students gained valuable skills including: 
1.Archival research skills 
2.Writing for documentary / communication skills 
3.Digital skills 
They also gained a developed sense of the realities of WW1 for people their own age, and the wider societal and cultural context to that conflict.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Undergraduate students</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Great War Book Launch, Imperial War Museum North, 14 September 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>540AE72D-DFD8-4398-BEA2-6E4FAB906CFC</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Book launch at the Imperial War Museum North of Nick Mansfield and Craig Horner (eds.), The Great War: Localities and Regional Identities (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2014) and Nick Mansfield (ed.), 'The Great War and the North West', Manchester Region History Review, vol. 24, 2013

Feedback on the conference was incredibly positive and attests to the broad impacts on attendees: 
'It was a really good mix of both academics and museum professionals which I haven't experienced before, and it was good to see both sides expressing opinions on the same ideas.'
'Overall, it was an enlightening and engaging conference. I thoroughly enjoyed it.'
'The variety in pace tone and approach. The conferencewas not a full on intellectual assault I felt that there was a time to listen a time to ask a time to talk and timeto reflect. I went to Oasis and I am unlikely to ever forget that.'
'Inspirational talks, thought-provoking discussions, some brilliant ideas!'
'New connections and networks built at the conference. Ideas for further reading. Reflection on my current research and practice about my role within the sector (am I vocal enough), about being explicit about what I present and how I know (authority) and the role of museums in narrative-making.'
'I really enjoyed the different venues, spaces and formats of the conference. I thought these suited the multidisciplinary nature of the conference really well and kept bringing up new things to talk about. I thought the overall quality of presentations was very high'
'it was inspiring and could well have an impact in the way I work here'
'the conversations around the 'activist' museum will certainly form part of my discussions at IWM about how we respond to Global Citizenship in our public programming. Partnership projects and how these can work has also informed my practice in this new role; particularly ensuring partners are involved in planning not just presented with an idea and asked to get involved at a later stage.'
'Firstly, I would like to thank all of the organisers and the host organisations for a truly inspiring conference. It was wonderful to get museum professionals and university researchers together in this way and I sincerely hope that there will be future gatherings'
'It was the slickest run conference I've ever been to with such a variety of inspiring and engaging talks and workshops. I'm due to write a report about the conference for my team but quite frankly, I'm not sure how I'll fit it all in!'

We encouraged participants to write a message to a loved one who has been away for a long time - getting them to think about what they would write at this time of year.
 
When participants came in we did a quick explanation of what was happening 100 years and tried to encourage participants to imagine they were back in 1915, and what this meant (no television / computer games!, rationing, family members away fighting).
 
We also had our First World War dressing up costumes and all our worksheets out to continue to get participants thinking about the centenary, what war means at this time of year, roles of men and women etc.
 
From informal conversations with people who came along I think it's fair to say a lot of the young people who participated didn't really have awareness it was the centenary of the 1st WW (not covered by curriculum), it must have been scary (especially in the trenches), it's sad not having family together at this time of year, nice that children sent postcards and made their own decorations.

The class gave school students a sense of what University teaching and learning involves, in a fun and inter-active way. The emphasis was on students receiving a positive and enjoyable learning experience that would raise their attainment and aspirations. 

93% of pupils said they found the workshop interesting and enjoyable and learnt something they didn't know before. 
80% of pupils said they gained skills that would help them to do better in exams and felt more confident about their understanding of WW1.

The following quotes are from pupils who attended: In the workshop I learnt more about universities and how they work with lectures for example. I also learnt about the first year of WW1 where at Christmas, the soldiers came together. 
 
I learnt more about the world war than what I did know previously 
 
I learnt how to critically analyse sources, and to give reasoning for suggestions 
 
I would like to do this type of thing again


93% of pupils said they found the workshop interesting and enjoyable and learnt something they didn't know before. 80% of pupils said they gained skills that would help them to do better in exams and felt more confident about their understanding of WW1. 67% said they felt more motivated to continue in education after finishing high school. 54% said they would consider studying at MMU in the future.

The film, These Dangerous Women, about the Congress of Women, had been funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund with the Women's History Network. It was made by the Clapham Film Unit and involved local women in the cast.

The background to this event at the Library was as follows. In March 1915 several leading members of Manchester Suffrage Society established a break away branch of the newly- established British Committee of the International Congress of Women in order to elect delegates for the proposed Congress planned for The Hague in late April 1915. A local meeting in March 1915 elected Margaret Ashton, the pacifist suffragist Independent councillor, Sarah Dickenson, the Salford based trade union campaigner and Sarah Reddish from Bolton, trade union and suffrage activist. All these women were well known in their day and were established women's rights activists. All were in their 60s.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Screening Rights</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>C0601B99-18DD-4FE3-907B-E86FE44F3BB2</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The event sparked discussions about the legacy of WW1.
