Further bandwidth growth between 40% and 300% is predicted in the next 3 years as a result of the growing popularity of bandwidth intensive applications. Energy efficiency is therefore increasingly becoming a key priority for ICT organizations given the obvious ecological and economic drivers. In this project we adopt the GreenTouch energy saving target of a factor of a 100 for Core Switching and Routing and believe this ambitious target is achievable should the research in this proposal prove successful. A key observation in core networks is that most of the power is consumed in the IP layer while optical transmission and optical switching are power efficient in comparison, hence the inspiration for this project. Therefore we will introduce energy efficient optimum physical network topologies that encourage optical transmission and optical switching at the expense of IP routing whenever possible. Initial studies by the applicants show that physical topology choices in networks have the potential to significantly reduce the power consumption, however network optimization and the consideration of traffic and the opportunities afforded by large, low power photonic switch architectures will lead to further power savings. We will investigate a large, high speed photonic switch architecture in this project, minimize its power consumption and determine optimum network physical topologies that exploit this switch to minimize power consumption. We will design new large photonic switch fabrics, based on hybrid semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOA) / Mach Zehnder interferometers as gating elements to minimise the switching energy per bit, and plan to optimize the network architecture making use of these new switch architectures and introduce (photonic) chip power monitoring to inform higher layer decisions. 
Networks are typically over provisioned at present to maintain quality of service. We will study optimum resource allocation to reduce the overprovisioning factor while maintaining the quality of service. Protection is currently provided in networks through the allocation of redundant paths and resources, and for full protection there is a protection route for every working route. We will optimize our networks to minimize power wastage due to protection. The power savings due to optimum physical topology design, optimum resource allocation, optical switching instead of IP routing, more efficient photonic switches and energy efficient protection can be combined and therefore the investigators and their industrial collaborators BT, Alcatel Lucent and Telekomunikacja Polska, believe that an ambitious factor of 100 power saving in core networks can be realised through this project with significant potential for resulting impact on how core photonic networks are designed and implemented.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The development of new network architectures, protocols and hardware to reduce the energy consumption of communication networks is of particular importance currently, and is one of the most exciting areas in the communications field. Optical networks play a crucial role in networking today, however, a new generation of energy-efficient, ubiquitous, high capacity and flexible optical networks is required. The proposed work will contribute to the research community on many fronts, firstly in the design of new energy efficient large photonic switching architectures and their use in optical networks to maximise energy efficiency. Here, design guidelines, and rules for dimensioning the network and its components will be derived. The results are of particular interest to equipment manufacturers and network operators seeking to redesign their network in the most energy efficient manner. Secondly, energy-efficient resource allocation, traffic engineering and routing strategies will be formulated and their performance assessed using analytic (eg. mixed integer linear programming optimisation) and simulation studies. This will enable the network operator to choose the most appropriate strategies for their network. Finally, a study of energy-aware survivability mechanisms will enable the network operator to design the most appropriate energy efficient survivability strategy that maximises the use of optical transmission and optical switching at the expense of IP routing.
As can be seen from the attached letters of support, there is considerable backing for this proposal from the collaborating industrial consortium. Whilst the programme has direct exploitation, we are delighted that there are several areas within the research activity which are at a basic and generic level and require technical breakthroughs. As a result, we believe that the project will be of benefit to the wider networking academic community, and allow the creation of links with other universities in the communications, networking and computing fields, both in the EU and internationally. Since the project will develop new technologies, components, sub-systems, architectures, protocols and algorithms it will also be of considerable interest to industry. For example, the architectures and protocols work will be of benefit to companies generally involved in network design and operation, carriers, Internet service providers, data centres and large ICT users. The hardware developments are of particular interest to network and communication equipment manufacturers, and indeed in wider applications where energy consumption is a major concern. The technical developments will be of particular benefit to the standards bodies (e.g. IEEE), government departments and the green ICT community. The programme will have tremendous economic benefits to the EU and internationally and fundamental transformational ecological benefits to our planet.

We will focus on maintaining and indeed growing links with our existing industrial collaborators as we believe that their markets will continue to grow. For example, Ethernet services are expected to grow substantially, with estimates of sales in the US alone being $27B over the next few years. Some industry analysts are anticipating a tripling of sales within 5 years despite the cost reduction pressures that will occur. The potential for the work in our proposal also to impact the $14B networking field is considerable. The energy reduction measures introduced in this project will have far reaching impact and their potential will be of direct benefit to the collaborating networking and equipment companies and beyond. This project will lead to exploitable concepts suitable for licensing, for example in energy efficient components, where we have an excellent track record in licensing to world leaders such as Avago with components already in production or in software, e.g. Xen or VNC.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-12-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-01-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>356078</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> IEEE COMSOC Student Competition, GreenMeter: Energy Efficient Core Networks  Leonard Nonde, University of Leeds, UK</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>77295FE9-4DA9-456B-93D4-597EBE7A0DBD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Student competition entry to raise the profile of Green ICT and energy efficiency.

Energy efficiency is therefore increasingly becoming a key priority for ICT organizations given the obvious ecological and economic drivers. 
In this project we adopt the GreenTouch energy saving goals in core network switching and routing where the internet protocol (IP) is used for packet addressing and routing, and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) is used for capacity. A key observation in core networks is that most of the power is consumed in the IP layer while optical transmission and optical switching are power efficient in comparison, hence the inspiration for this project.

We have studied the optimisation of the physical topology of IP over WDM networks with the objective of minimising the total network power consumption. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model has been developed to optimise the physical topology under different IP over WDM approaches and nodal degree constraints. We have considered the NSFNET topology and compared its energy consumption with the energy consumption of optimised physical topologies. The results show that optimising the physical topology without a limit on the number of links results in a full-mesh topology with significant power savings of 95%. 

We have also introduced the use of network coding as an effective technique for IP over WDM networks combining energy efficiency and cost reduction. We have developed a MILP model for non-bypass IP over WDM networks where a simple XOR operation is used to encode unicasting traffic flows. The results show that network coding introduces savings up to 20% compared to the classical IP over WDM networks. The results also show that higher power savings, up to 30% are obtained for topologies of high hop count such as the ring topology.

As an example of the application of our networking concepts, we have introduced a framework for designing energy efficient cloud computing services over IP/WDM core networks. We developed a MILP model to investigate three cloud services: Cloud Content Delivery, Storage as a Service (StaaS), and Virtual Machines placement for processing applications. We studied the optimisation of network related factors including the centralisation versus distribution of clouds and the impact of demand, content popularity and access frequency on the clouds placement, and cloud capability factors including the number of servers, switches and routers and amount of storage required in each cloud. Our results indicate that replicating content into multiple clouds based on content popularity yields 43% total saving in power consumption compared to power un-aware centralised content delivery. 
We extended our framework for designing energy efficient physical topologies of core networks to consider the design of energy resilient physical topologies. We have developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model that considers in addition to minimising the operational and embodied energies, minimising the average hop count to ensure that when a link fails and a connection is rerouted the new route is not much longer in terms of hop count than the original route. The results show that the increase in operational power consumption in case of link failure can be limited at a cost of a slight increase in the operational and embodied energies of the energy resilient topologies compared to the power minimised topologies.

We studied the impact of renewable energy availability, represented by wind farms, on the location of clouds and the content replication schemes of cloud content over IP/WDM networks. The results show that building mini-clouds in different network locations based on content popularity is the most energy-efficient approach when clouds are powered by non-renewable sources or when renewable energy is restricted. However, a trade-off between transmission losses and non-renewable power consumption in the IP/WDM network exists when there is enough renewable energy to power all the clouds.

We studied the energy efficiency of BitTorrent-based P2P systems taking into account the presence of renewable energy sources. The results show that the renewable energy sources can be efficiently tapped in a P2P system by optimising the routing table so that the number of traversed nodes powered by non-renewable power is minimised, while local peers selection is maintained. 

We have investigated the problem of virtual Network embedding (VNE) in IP over Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) networks to take advantage of the flexibility offered by O-OFDM compared to rigid WDM networks. Two approaches were proposed: power minimised O-OFDM networks and spectrum minimised O-OFDM networks. Virtual network embedding in IP over O-OFDM network under both approaches is shown to outperform VNE in a 100 Gb/s IP over WDM network with average power savings of 63% and 17%, respectively.

We have explored the dynamics of TV viewing behaviour and program popularity to develop a time-driven cache replacement strategy to minimise the power consumption of standard definition and high-definition IPTV delivered over an IP-over-WDM network. Our results show that the cache hit ratios have increased under this strategy and so the network power consumption is reduced by up to 86% compared to no caching. 

We have investigated the problem of energy-efficient traffic scheduling in IP over WDM networks by developing a MILP model and a real-time heuristic to allocate network resources with the objective of minimising the total network power consumption. The results show that energy-efficient network resource allocation (according to the scheduling opportunities/requirements) and allowing the rerouting of reserved and existing traffic requests can save up to 58% of the network power consumption compared to optimising the resource allocation to minimise the blocking probability.
We have investigated the impact of maximising profit on the power consumption and acceptance of virtual network requests (VNRs) in core networks with clouds. The results show that higher acceptance rates do not necessarily lead to higher profit due to the high cost associated with accepting some of the requests. In order to obtain optimal power consumption in the network, we minimised the power consumption for the same optimal profit and the results indicated that we can achieve lower power consumption for the same profit. Using the insights from the models, we developed a Profit Optimised and Energy Minimised heuristic, (POEM), with nearly the same power consumption, profit and VNR acceptance performance as the MILP model. 

We have investigated the effective use of renewable energy in virtual resource allocation in IP/WDM core networks with clouds as a means of reducing the carbon footprint. We developed a Green Virtual Network Embedding (GVNE) framework for minimising the use of non-renewable energy through intelligent provisioning of bandwidth and cloud data center resources. The problem is modelled as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and the results show that CO2 emissions could be reduced by up to 48% and that it is better to instantiate virtual machines in cloud data centers that have access to abundant renewable energy even at the expense of traversing multiple links across the network. While it is important for cloud infrastructure owners to address the problem of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, they are also equally concerned about the operational expenditure (OPEX) that is associated with electricity costs in the network. We have shown that completely focusing on reduction of non-renewable power consumption has the potential to significantly increase the overall OPEX associated with electricity consumption considering the geographical price discrimination of electricity. We have therefore developed a framework that addresses both concerns of reducing electricity costs and GHG emissions. The results of our developed model show that while maintaining the electricity cost at the lowest optimal value, GHG emissions could be reduced by up to 16%. 

An efficient approach to address the power consumption challenge of transferring large volumes of data in big data networks is to progressively process large volumes of data as close to its source as possible and transport the reduced volume of extracted knowledge to the destination. We developed a MILP model to optimise the processing of huge volumes of data generated by different user zones in a progressive manner among different nodes of the core networks to reduce the network power consumption. Accordingly, a noteworthy decrease in data transferred is achieved which results in a generous reduction in network power consumption. We considered the 4Vs of big data to determine the impact of the proposed progressive processing on network power consumption as follows: Volume (with direct implications on power needs), Velocity (with impact on delay requirements), Variety (with varying of big data applications) and Veracity (with reliability and trustworthiness constraints). 

IoT is expected to benefit from the wide spectrum of proposed energy efficient network solutions. Cloud computing is one of the main approaches investigated to reduce data centre and network power consumption. We introduced a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to address the energy efficiency in IoT networks supported by cloud computing. The processing of IoT traffic is handled by Virtual Machines (VMs) hosted in distributed mini clouds and/or located near the IoT networking elements. We optimised the number of mini clouds, their location and the placement of VMs to reduce the total power consumption induced by traffic aggregation and processing. Our results showed that the optimal distribution of mini clouds in the IoT network can yield total power savings of up to 36% compared to processing IoT data in a single mini cloud located at the gateway layer.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Implemented by vendors, operators and service providers to improve core network energy efficiency</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>8C8A815B-EA34-411F-8BEC-BEF28A235A92</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://project-star.org.uk/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>IEEE P1928.1?
