The changes involved fundamental modifications to skeletons - from supports for swimming musculature in water to robust weight-bearing struts and cantilevers for walking and running on land, as well as changes to physiological and sensory systems. These latter changes also had influences on the skeleton that in turn affected the locomotor patterns. Over the last few years we have a gained a much improved fossil record of the animals that represent this transition. It has vastly improved since the days when only two taxa were available (the fish Eusthenopteron and the tetrapod Ichthyostega): we now have the elpistostegids Panderichthys and Tiktaalik, and the tetrapod Acanthostega. These newly discovered skeletons are well enough known to permit hypotheses about relationships and sequences of character acquisition. However, this is only part of the story. It is now evident that the two Devonian tetrapods whose skeletons are adequately known (Acanthostega and Ichthyostega) differ radically not just from modern tetrapods, but from each other. They represent divergent answers to some of the problems of emerging from the water. Ichthyostega and Acanthostega are evolutionary icons of importance comparable to that of other critical 'transitional forms' such as Archaeopteryx (the first bird), Australopithecus (e.g., 'Lucy'), and Ambulocetus (an early 'walking whale'). Acanthostega though possessing limbs with digits was still basically aquatic. On the other hand, the popular image of Ichthyostega as a sturdy land-going quadruped has been shown to be quite erroneous: in fact it was highly aberrant skeletally, having morphological traits that suggest both aquatic and terrestrial specialisations. Its mode of locomotion appears to have been more like that of a seal than a salamander, and its skeleton, according to work by the PI and colleagues, seems to have allowed dorsoventral flexion using a regionalised vertebral column and differentiated musculature as in mammals. We want to test both these diverse models of early tetrapod morphology for their accuracy quantitatively and in three dimensions, which our earlier attempts were unable to do. This we will do by subjecting the specimens to recently developed high-tech methods including microCT, CT and laser scanning, 3D reconstruction and manipulation software that allow us to do this for the first time. Next, we will examine the range of movements of the skeletons to assess what they were capable of, and quantify key indices of biomechanical performance such as regional stiffness of the vertebral column as well as internal bone architecture. For this, we will compare particular parts of the skeleton - centra, neural arches, ribs, limbs and girdles - with modern tetrapods to try to understand, using modern quantitative techniques, how the Devonian tetrapods moved, to what conditions they were most suited, and thus to what environments and life styles they were best adapted. This will help to illuminate the earliest conditions of the transition from water to land and ultimately lead to greater understanding of how modern tetrapod skeletons evolved. This will not only enhance our understanding of the transition from water to land, but lay the foundations and establish the starting conditions for the eventual appearance of the truly terrestrial members of the tetrapod crown group, and thus our own remote ancestors.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2012-07-08</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471"><gtr:id>8A03ED41-E67D-4F4A-B5DD-AAFB272B6471</gtr:id><gtr:name>NERC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2009-07-09</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>214472</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Humboldt University of Berlin</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Germany, Federal Republic of</gtr:country><gtr:description>New collaboration with John Nyakatura (Humboldt University)</gtr:description><gtr:id>B204B11D-9962-4203-BFE9-D48EB311C002</gtr:id><gtr:impact>still pending</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>New data and analysis tools for studying amniote locomotion and reconstructing gait in fossil taxa.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>New collaboration on evolution of land animal locomotion, focusing on amniotes (advanced land animals).

The National Geographic channel also bought the series, increasing the potential reach to 160 million homes in 143 countries. Prof. Hutchinson was a consultant for the programme, editing scripts and providing 60 hours of paid scientific/technical expertise as well as appearing onscreen in 2 episodes and giving acknowledged input on the website content. BBSRC-funded elephant research was featured in 1 episode, and NERC-funded crocodile research in another (Nat. Geo.); both by Prof. Hutchinson. His invitation to act as a consultant on this production was a direct result of the scientific publications on elephant locomotion and his personal interactions with zoos and elephant keepers during the research. Three further series have followed, with episodes broadcast on PBS in the USA in 2012. Since 2011, a book, DVDs and iPad App have been sold based on the programmes.

Regular visits from school groups to museum exhibits.

Hutchinson's expertise and publications in the field of dinosaur locomotion have led to contributions to the design of interactive exhibits produced for extensive museum tours. He was the Chief Palaeontology Advisor, providing the main quality control on scientific evidence, for the 'Be The Dinosaur' travelling museum exhibit, which includes an immersive multi-player video experience, and which has toured 25 museums in the USA and Canada since 2008. Curators have reported increased attendance (&amp;quot;We had a 9% increase in attendance over the previous summer while many other Museums in our State experienced a drop in attendance over the same timeframe.&amp;quot; Executive Director, Mid-America Science Museum), together with visitor enthusiasm (&amp;quot;this exhibit was a huge hit with both kids and adults, resulting in a noticeable increase in attendance.&amp;quot; Vice-President of Exhibits and Operations, The Children's Museum of the Upstate). They have also commented on quality content (&amp;quot; engaging interactive technology, a wealth of scientific information collected by experts in the field of Paleontology, and an unforgettable learning experience.&amp;quot; Marketing and Exhibits Manager, ETSU/Gen) and positive educational value (&amp;quot;The educational content was superb and the best part was that young and old alike learned about science in a hands-on way.&amp;quot; Director of Education, &amp;quot;Queen of Discovery&amp;quot;, GWIZ - The Science Museum).

The RVC research on giant animals was explained and featured prominently as part of a second travelling museum exhibit, &amp;quot;Dinosaurs: Ancient Fossils, New Discoveries&amp;quot;, which has attracted approximately 1.5 million visitors spread across 10 museums on two continents since 2008. The writer/producer from the American Museum of Natural History, who produced the 'Walking with T. rex' video within the exhibition, commented: &amp;quot;The exhibition demonstrates to visitors that scientists are still debating and arguing about evidence Theropod Biomechanics, utilizing Professor Hutchinson's research findings, is an integral section of the exhibition YouTube video of the 'walking' mechanical T. rex from the exhibition has been posted by a member of the public, receiving 8,700 views [9,500 by 7/13], with written commentary and comments indicating real engagement with the science.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>true</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://www.bethedinosaur.com/</gtr:url><gtr:year>Pre-2006,2006,2007,2008,</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Science Blog</gtr:description><gtr:form>A magazine, newsletter or online publication</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9437DBCB-0541-4FD7-A695-AE5A238B9A49</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Anatomy blog: sharing the latest scientific research and insights from Prof. Hutchinson's team, with a strong focus on RCUK-funded research.

This hypothesis has been refuted: Ichthyostega had very restricted ranges of motion in both fore and hind limbs, and could not place its hind feet flat on the ground. Thus its locomotion was unlike that of any modern tetrapod. Its hind limbs were more likely adapted for swimming than walking, whereas its fore limbs served to support the front part of the body off the ground during 'crutching-style' locomotion. (Pierce et al. 2012)

(2) Acanthostega's possible vertebral and limb ranges of motion do not differ appreciably from those of a giant salamander.

This hypothesis still remains to be tested. Synchrotron scanning results await analysis in terms of biomechanical potential.


Objectives: (1) Three-dimensionally image the key skeletal elements of the best-preserved specimens of Ichthyostega and Acanthostega as well as at least four potential extant analogs (1 individual each: giant salamander, ringed seal, Eurasian otter, and Australian freshwater crocodile) with microCT, CT and laser scanning. These have largely been achieved. Publications resulting include a study of pinniped vertebral construction (Pierce et al, 2011), and other publications on the extant taxa will follow. The data have been collected. We have, so far, been unable to source a suitable giant salamander for CT scanning; test scans of 2 specimens proved unsuitable due to poor preservative fluid/flesh vs. skeleton contrast. However, we did source several more salamanders and lizards for comparison.

(2) Digitally reconstruct the skeletons of our study taxa in 3D using modern graphics software.

This has been achieved for Ichthyostega and has been published in Nature (Pierce et al. 2012). Scan data have been acquired for Acanthostega and for the related taxon Pederpes. Acanthostega material proved much more problematic. However we have been able to model its vertebral construction, which has corroborated our new view of tetrapod vertebral architecture.

(3) Articulate the 3D digital skeletons of our study taxa in DinoMorph software and quantify their 3D ranges of joint motion in the key vertebral and limb joints.

This has been achieved and published as in (2), although software other than DinoMorph was used because we were not granted access to that proprietary software; this did not impede our success on the project.

(4) Quantitatively compare and contrast possible vertebral and limb joint ranges of motion in Ichthyostega and Acanthostega with those of our potential extant analogs.

This has been achieved for limb joint ranges of Ichthyostega, as above.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>Our 2012 paper on vertebral morphology is already stimulating others to take a new, fresh look at tetrapod(omorph) vertebral evolution, and the earlier paper on limb motion in Ichthyostega has stimulated a lot more biomechanical research in this area (32 citations; e.g. report by Hutchinson in Nature News&amp;amp;Views in 2014: http://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2014/08/28/plastic-fishapods/).</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>693B3756-8C86-4658-B4A6-AA0E4398CACB</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Other</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://whatsinjohnsfreezer.com/2012/05/23/ichthyostega-party-time/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Publically accessible database of whole-body CT and MRI scans of multiple crocodile specimens from ancillary research in the NERC-funded projects (acknowledged support).</gtr:description><gtr:id>10CE8220-BCEC-4586-BE4C-6C0BAE8E613C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Notification from multiple colleagues that they are using these open data in their own research and will be citing it.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Crocodile CT scan data</gtr:title><gtr:type>Database/Collection of data</gtr:type><gtr:url>https://osf.io/x38nh/wiki/home/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2016</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>3D models of dinosaur bodies and code to run analyses published in Nature by Allen et al. in 2013</gtr:description><gtr:id>B48FBF1F-2254-4C38-B6F6-D0DDD7124AE3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>too soon to be sure.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>true</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Linking the evolution of body shape and locomotor biomechanics in bird-line archosaurs: 3D models of dinosaurs</gtr:title><gtr:type>Computer model/algorithm</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.hh74n</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2013</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Large datasets from micro-CT and synchrotron-CT scanning have been generated.
