Kenya's 2013 elections have widely been seen as a crucial test of the impact of donor interventions and new institutional arrangements to deliver peaceful and credible elections. In the aftermath of the disputed elections of 2007 and the violence that followed, a substantial programme of political reform was drawn up, which intended to ensure a combination of democratic consolidation and institutional renewal that would prevent any repeat of such violence, or of the malpractice which helped to trigger it. These internationally supported changes included a new constitution and a raft of new legislation on political parties and elections, as well as security sector reform, a transformation of the judiciary and an entirely new election commission.

A wide range of bilateral parties, international agencies, and Kenyan civil society groups, provided substantial external support for these far-reaching processes, and for the 2013 elections themselves. In all, this amounts to an unusually sustained and comprehensive attempt to remake governance - all conducted without any change of regime, and in the life of a single parliament. Yet it is already clear that the impact of these reforms has been uneven. In the run up to the election, key parts of the legislative framework were removed, while security reform was never genuinely pursued. The conduct of the elections thus provides valuable evidence as to whether, how far, and in what ways this kind of programme of legal and institutional reform and electoral support can produce political transformation.

This project will analyse the effectiveness of this international and national effort in the light of the events of the election itself. It will use this analysis to develop recommendations for further support to reform and electoral processes in Kenya, and to identify comparative lessons for programmes of reform and electoral support elsewhere. The recommendations will be aimed both at Kenya's international partners in the UK government and in other governments and agencies, and at Kenyans directly involved in the reform process - whether within government, or as part of civil society organizations. 

The project builds directly on, and will develop, an emerging cooperation between policy-makers in the UK government and a group of academic researchers. Through this partnership, the UK government - through the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) - is currently funding the first phase of this research on the Kenya elections by Lynch, Cheeseman and Willis. This research is directly informing UK government contingency planning and current electoral support work through reports and regular meetings between the researchers and staff from the FCO, DfID and MoD, in the UK and in Kenya. 

Through circulation of reports and through meetings, the research is also being shared with the UK's international partners, and with some international agencies as well as with civil society organizations in Kenya. As a result, the project will have a real world impact that will extend beyond Kenya and the UK. The project has already provided a substantial body of data on the elections, and has generated a network of contacts with research-users in the UK, Kenya and more widely. The knowledge exchange phase will ensure that this research-based knowledge is used effectively in further promoting reform in Kenya, and in applying the lessons learned from this to programmes of political reform and democratic consolidation in other countries.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>This project addresses the question of the conditions under which democratization is successful, and how donor governments can best promote democratic consolidation. This is a topic of great significance to a range of international governments and agencies, as well as the millions of people who live in emerging democracies.

Knowledge exchange: 

The project is primarily concerned with feeding lessons learnt from Kenya's 2013 election back into future electoral and constitutional reform in Kenya and other semi-democratic regimes. An initial pre-election phase was funded by the UK's African Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP), which demonstrates an existing collaborative partnership. The findings will also be of great relevance to civil-society and donor efforts to strengthen electoral systems and the quality of democracy around the world. Users will include:

(1) NGOs, policy makers, and pro-democracy advocates in Kenya;

(2) International promoters of free and fair elections in the UK policy community (FCO, DfID), in the international donor community (such as the European Union, Unites States Agency for International Development (USAID), and United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and in the regional consultative bodies (such as the African Union and East African Community).

(3) International agencies concerned with conflict management and resolution, within the UK policy community (the ACPP: FCO, DFID, MOD), and international bodies such as the United Nations.

(4) Think tanks and policy advisory bodies such as the International Crisis Group (ICG) and Human Rights Watch (HRW). 

Non-academic users will benefit in a variety of ways, enabling better informed and more effective work by donors, agencies, and civil society groups, and thus fostering a higher quality and more stable democracy in Kenya and elsewhere.

(1) By accessing new data about the context within which they work (the political economy of Kenya) and so being able to make more informed decisions, which has been highlighted by the UK government as one of the major 'value added' points of the current project. 

(2) By accessing new information concerning the effectiveness of their strategies and interventions in Kenya, allowing them to make more informed decisions. The ACPP has explicitly stated this should be a goal of the second stage of this project, and fits with DFID's focus on Monitoring and Evaluation. 

(3) Through the opportunity to collectively share, analyse, and evaluate past experiences with other organizations, researchers and agencies involved in electoral support and governance reform in Kenya. Policy makers have repeatedly told the researchers that they lack time to reflect on their overall goals and to 'compare notes' with colleagues, even when working collaboratively. 

(4) As a result of specific and viable recommendations regarding the best way that donors, international agencies, and civil society groups, can support long-term peace and democratization in Kenya and similar countries.

(5) From new networks that will be built as a result of the repeated interaction of members of civil society, donors and international agencies at meetings and dissemination events, facilitating future collaboration.

While knowledge exchange with policy makers is the focus of this project, there will also be some academic beneficiaries as a by-product of this work:

(1) Academics interested in African and Kenyan politics, who will benefit from new empirical and theoretical contributions on the Kenyan elections of 2013 and the role played by civil society actors, donors and security services.

(2) Academics engaged in the study of elections, democracy promotion, and conflict avoidance, who will benefit from new empirical and theoretical advances in the study of the activities and strategies employed by international policy makers.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-09-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>57648</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Drawing upon research findings from this project, Justin Willis was one of three academics who helped design and create this exhibition.

It began as a cooperation on long-term election monitoring and conflict early warning, funded by the UK government Africa Conflict Prevention Programme (ACPP). Funding through the Knowledge Exchange programme then allowed that cooperation to be developed and extended to include a retrospective analysis of lessons learned from Kenya's 2013 elections and research on the challenges and prospects for the rolling-out of Kenya's new constitution in the wake of those elections.

The cooperation with the constituent parts of the ACPP (FCO, DfID and MoD) has provided regular access to policy-makers throughout the period of the research and in its aftermath. The research team have provided regular spoken and written briefings to the ACPP, initially focussed on elections and then broadening out into consideration of devolution, the implementation of the constitution, and security. Members of the research team have met eight times with policy-makers in London and Nairobi for formal briefings; they have also had three informal closed-door sessions with the British High Commissioner in Nairobi, and been asked to provide and discuss a series of 'scenario scanning' options for future political developments in order to inform policy discussions. 

Reports submitted were also widely circulated beyond the ACPP and, over the course of the project, briefings were directly discussed with officials from a number of governments and organisations including UNDP, EU, USAID, the American Embassy in Nairobi, CIDA, Canadian Embassy, Japanese Embassy, Royal Norwegian Embassy, the Dutch Embassy, Royal Embassy of Denmark, High Commission of Canada, Australian High Commission, Belgian Embassy, National Democratic Institute, French Foreign Office, US State Department, and the National Intelligence Council of the USA.

Through the contacts provided by these meetings, members of the team also were invited to make presentations at the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague and to the Belgian ambassador in Nairobi. The research experience, and reputation, derived from this engagement led to further presentations and briefings: to a closed door meeting of UK and US policy-makers, and an audience of French diplomats and military staff. 

More recently, the team have been engaged in the start of a new series of discussions with donors and diplomats in Nairobi regarding preparations for Kenya's next general election in August 2017. 

The direct impact of these briefings on policy decisions has not always been disclosed for reasons of security and confidentiality. However, UK based policy makers have consistently stressed the influence of the project, which is demonstrated by the fact that the team were specifically requested to prepare a report on the lessons learnt from donor engagement in the 2013 election, and what should be done ahead of the next general elections. More generally, the repeated nature of the briefings and invitations suggests that the research knowledge provided by the project has been highly valued: the Head of the Central/Southern Africa division in the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the team that 'As you have noticed there was a lot of interest in your presentation. As far as we are concerned, something to be repeated'. In the wake of the project, the research team was also asked to provide an analysis and policy recommendations for UK policy actions around elections intended to promote stability in Kenya. 

Moreover, Cheeseman was subsequently asked to help implement a project modelled on this research for the United Nations Development Programme ahead of the Nigerian elections of 2015, on the basis of positive evaluations of the Kenyan project within the donor community. This indicates that both the lessons generated by the project and the very method of long-term academic election monitoring that the project pioneered have been influential both within Kenya and beyond.

Alongside this direct engagement with policy-makers in the UK and allied governments, the project has engaged directly with the public and policy-makers in Kenya through the newspaper opinion pieces written by Gabrielle Lynch and Nic Cheeseman in the Saturday Nation and Sunday Nation respectively. These are widely read and commented upon in Kenya, and have encouraged public discussion over the project research findings relating both to the conduct of the elections and to the implementation of the new constitution. Through radio appearances, many of these lessons have also been shared beyond Kenya via the BBC and other media.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2013</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>8F9E785F-4140-418A-B6A1-274B55EFAEA2</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Government, Democracy and Justice,Security and Diplomacy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>ELECTIONS AND DEMOCRATISATION: 

Despite peaceful polls in 2013, the ethnic tensions that underpinned Kenya's 2007 elections remain and, as a result, electoral violence continues to be a major threat. It is important to make sure that efforts to promote a 'peace narrative' go hand-in-hand with a commitment to allowing opposition parties their democratic right to hold rallies and criticise the government.

Kenya's electoral commission needs stronger and more effective leadership, greater technical capacity, and an injection of experienced and committed manpower. 

Many Kenyans do not understand how the new two-round electoral process works, which has serious implications for future elections when a second round is likely to be required. Civic education efforts around elections should be integrated into broader outreach programmes about the political system and should be rolled out well in advance of polling day.

Current rules and regulations governing the release of election results are insufficient to ensure the timely release of results. This makes it almost impossible to produce hard evidence of electoral manipulation within the time frames demanded for petition processes under Kenya's new constitution. 

Electoral technology is no substitute for comprehensive election monitoring by domestic monitors and party agents.

In the absence of socio-economic change or political will, institutional regulations are unlikely to change established ways of mobilising support. Political leaders - and hence the parties they create - are unlikely to change their behaviour unless they believe that they will win more votes by doing so. 

Donor promotion of prosecutions (for example, at the International Criminal Court) can have a valuable deterrent effect on the deployment of political violence, but leaves the international community open to damaging accusations of political interference.

DEVOLUTION AND SECURITY: 

The majority of Kenyans remain supportive of devolution, even though the new county governments have fallen far short of popular expectations. Most people who support devolution do so because it &amp;quot;brings resources to the grassroots&amp;quot;. Most people who reject devolution do so because of the cost and because it fosters local divisions.

Events so far suggest that there has been some real devolution of power in Kenya, but that county governments have become fields for local battles over patronage with much energy expended on new political battles at the county level. 

Minority groups are increasingly angry at what they perceive to be their ongoing marginalisation despite the new constitution's promises of inclusivity, and devolution has exacerbated existing tensions in some areas. 

Meanwhile, the reformed judiciary - originally envisaged as the guardian of the new constitution - has become a political battleground and seems unable to act consistently in support of the principles of devolution. 

The public feel increasingly vulnerable to crime, and the government's approach to the problem of terrorism and radicalisation has remained heavy on the side of repression and light in the building of community relations as well as the prevention of radicalisation. In these circumstances, while external support for Kenya's security services is likely to continue, this is unlikely to produce systematic improvement in efficiency or respect for human rights and the rule of law.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The project's approach to election-monitoring has informed discussions and plans for academic involvement in UK government election-monitoring projects in other parts of Africa (including Uganda and Zambia). 

Project reports have been taken up by FCO and DfID in their planning for programme activities in Kenya in 2017. 

Findings on the need to balance 'peace' with 'justice' can help inform future peace-building efforts in Kenya and beyond. 

Findings on devolution - as one of the first studies of devolution in Kenya - can make a significant contribution to people's understandings and academic
