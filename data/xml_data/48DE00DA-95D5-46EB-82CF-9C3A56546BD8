The first phase of the official history of British intelligence was marked by the release of Sir Harry Hinsley's multi-volume history of British intelligence in the Second World War. We reached the second phase of institutional history in 2010 with the release of the official histories of SIS and the Security Service. Intelligence history has been marked by an analytical concern with institutions, 'intelligence failure', 'intelligence success' and the quantification of the relative importance of intelligence for politics and military operations. Intelligence history has not, however, always been linked to wider developments in modern historiography, specifically the 'cultural turn'. Intelligence history has developed either along national lines, 'British intelligence' etc., or through the study of international intelligence alliances, e.g. the UK-USA alliance. Britain is an acknowledged leader in intelligence history and supports a vibrant community of scholars. Other countries, specifically Germany, in the opinion of the German project collaborators, lag behind. There is thus room for an approach that stresses two relatively new elements in intelligence history: the study of intelligence 'culture'; and the comparative study of unallied intelligence cultures, and the transnational links between them. The project will interrogate whether there are distinctive national intelligence cultures. It will ask whether the intelligence field, by its very functioning, creates the 'secret service disposition' without which it could not function. It will further interrogate the existence of specific national habitats, the durable set of cognitive and affective dispositions rooted in early socialization, the characteristic ways of moving, speaking, and interacting with others that create and sustain the immediate complicity within a culture. National intelligence cultures will be compared in an analysis of transnational culture. The comparison of national cultures will open up the possibility that there is, in fact, an intelligence 'game', constituting an objective transnational complicity which underlies all antagonisms. The project team maintain that human intelligence provides the best vehicle for such a study. Thanks, in part, to popular history a binary divide has opened up between the study of scientific intelligence, particularly signals intelligence and its variants, and human intelligence. The latter is often portrayed as more amateurish and less important than the former. Nothing could be further from the truth. German historians have recently demonstrated that human intelligence itself developed into a scientific pursuit over the course of the twentieth-century. Using the example of Prisoner-of-War interrogations they have demonstrated that human intelligence became more massified, more technological and more scientific during the first half of the century. Yet human intelligence could never dispense with the 'ghost in the machine'. It was marked by constant interaction between officers, agents, archivists, scientists, doctors, interrogators, prisoners, journalists, wider society. In other words the study human intelligence provides the classic building blocks for the study of culture. The project team have developed a six-fold matrix with which to analyse intelligence. It comprises a vertical analysis of: a) public discourses on military intelligence; b) the public treatment of military intelligence by experts; and, c) the discourse within the military, and military praxis, that is, the exchange of opinions within the apparatuses. The horizontal axis comprises: a) the place of the secret services in society and the military; b) personification, and c) the types of knowledge that the intelligence services were interested in, and their sources of information.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>\n1. The intelligence services of the UK and other friendly powers. The research comprises a meta-analysis of the conduct of intelligence operations in the past. It thus constitutes a tool for self-understanding by intelligence professionals. The researchers stand entirely outside the intelligence community: they are not co-dependent in the fashion of applied researchers or official historians. The research will benefit the 'strategic spy' who wishes to understand his or her field beyond questions of professional practice, the intelligence cycle or intelligence failure.\n\n2. The UK media. Journalists and commentators are called upon to analyse and comment on intelligence on a daily basis. By the nature of this endeavour intelligence tends to be understood in binary terms, e.g. commentators/practioners, failure/success. This research will offer a different perspective that is neverthless useable for producers and journalists. The PI can offer an example from a previous phase of research. In November 2009 BBC Radio 4's investigative series Document broadcast a programme Britain's use of torture in the Second World War. Its investigation centred on the career of Edinburgh University professor, Alexander Kennedy. In 1960 Kennedy made a speech at the Royal Institution on the subject of 'brainwashing'. He discussed techniques for using sensory deprivation and 'truth drugs' to break a prisoner. Kennedy's words stirred a controversy in the press and parliament, culminating in the then prime minister, Harold Macmillan, denying to the House of Commons that Britain had ever indulged in such techniques.The programme makers did not believe Macmillan but all their interviewees from the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (Middle East) denied all knowledge of Kennedy and his methods. The PI was able to identify Kennedy as a member of SIME - Security Intelligence Middle East, a little-known joint venture between the armed forces and the Security Service, and thus to produced the files relating to his activities. This identification rested on a knowledge of the complex culture of intelligence in wartime Cairo, a complexity that often eludes non-specialists. There were many military human intelligence agencies at any one time. They overlapped, metamorphosed and shared personnel.\n\n3. UK Museums. The PI works closely with the National War Museums of Scotland, particularly the National War Museum, Edinburgh Castle. The museum has put on a number of successful temporary exhibitions on UK special forces, for example Commando Country. The work of scientific human intelligence, involving or affecting Scots, could form the basis for a future exhibit.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-11-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>279551</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>AHRC Cultures of Intelligence research project on film
Published: 23 January 2015
The School of History's AHRC-funded Cultures of Intelligence research project has a German partner project - also called Cultures of Intelligence - funded by the Gerda Henkel Foundation. In the autumn of 2014 The Gerda Henkel Foundation commissioned Peter Prestel Filmproduktion of Eichst&amp;auml;tt (www.peterprestel.com/) to make a documentary series about Cultures of Intelligence. The Gerda Henkel filmmakers visited the University of Leeds to film extensive interviews with the Leeds project team. The resulting documentary series combined location shooting in Berlin, London and Leeds, archival footage and interviews with the investigators, postgrads and post-docs. The series eventually comprised nine episodes.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3831CCD4-5CEA-4662-B1AC-3EBAFDC4DE12</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The documentary series was publicly released by the Gerda Henkel Stiftung via L.I.S.A - Das Wissenschaftsportal der Gerda Henkel Stiftung. The documentary assists the Gerda Henkel Stiftung, as a not-for-profit foundation under German private law, in its core mission to visibly promote science by supporting specific projects in the field of humanities that have a defined specialist scope. In recent years the Foundation has also increasingly prioritised issues of great relevance to contemporary life and the future, as part of its mission.

The investigation into the cultures of intelligence yields a set of systematic insights that differ from those offered by investigations into specific bureaucracies or operations. The stress is shifted to the wealth of information rather than the many well-publicised gaps in the archival record.

The research has been taking place in partnership with a parallel project in Germany (Mainz, Mannheim, Potsdam). Comparison of findings suggests that British intelligence culture - rather than German intelligence culture - was the outlier. The projects will investigate and develop this theme further.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>An element of the underlying research will serve as a guide for any researcher in the intelligence field.
