Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing will create a sustainable and multidisciplinary body of expertise that will act as a UK and international focus - the 'go to' place for additive manufacturing and its applications. The Centre will undertake a user-defined and user-driven programme of innovative research that underpins Additive Manufacturing as a sustainable and value-adding manufacturing process across multiple industry sectors.Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the direct production of end-use component parts made using additive layer manufacturing technologies. It enables the manufacture of geometrically complex, low to medium volume production components in a range of materials, with little, if any, fixed tooling or manual intervention beyond the initial product design. AM enables a number of value chain configurations, such as personalised component part manufacture but also economic low volume production within high cost base economies. This innovative approach to manufacturing is now being embraced globally across industry sectors from high value aerospace / automotive manufacture to the creative and digital industries. To date AM research has almost exclusively focused upon the production of single material, homogeneous structures (in polymers, metals and ceramics). The EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing will move away from single material, 'passive' AM processes and applications that exhibit conventional levels of functionality, toward the challenges of investigating next generation, multi-material active additive manufacturing processes, materials and design systems. This transformative approach is required for the production of the new generation of high-value, multi-functional products demanded by industry. The Centre will initially explore two themes as the centrepieces of a wider research portfolio, supported by a range of platform activities. The first theme takes on the challenge of how to design, integrate and effectively implement multi-material, multi-functional manufacturing systems capable of matching the requirements of industrial end-users for 'ready-assembled' multifunctional devices and structures. Working at the macro level, this will involve the convergence of several approaches to increase embedded value to the product during the manufacturing stage by the direct printing / deposition of electronic / optical tracks potentially on a voxel by voxel basis; the processing and bonding of dissimilar materials that ordinarily require processing at varying temperatures and conditions will be particularly challenging. The second theme will explore the potential for 'scaling down' AM for small, complex components, extending single material AM to the printing of optical / electronic pathways within micro-level products and with a vision to directly print electronics integrally. The platform activities will provide the opportunity to undertake both fundamental and industry driven pilot studies that both feed into and derive from the theme-based research, and grow the capacity and capability of the Centre, creating a truly national UK Centre and Network that maintains the UK at the front of international research and industrial exploitation in Additive Manufacturing.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Additive Manufacturing (AM) is the direct production of end-use component parts made using additive layer manufacturing technologies. AM enables the manufacture of geometrically complex, low to medium volume production components in a range of materials, with little, if any, fixed tooling or manual intervention beyond the initial product design. It enables a number of value chain configurations, such as personalised component part manufacture but also economic low volume production within high cost base economies. The concept of 'active' AM is to use the layer wise approach to add value to a component part during manufacture. This could be by embedding electronic interconnects or optical pathways into the parts during production, or by using different materials in the same part to add functions that cannot be achieved in a single manufacturing step using conventional processes. This might be the production of parts with dissimilar mechanical or thermal properties, the production of parts with different functional surface coatings or the production of parts with new materials that exhibit increased mechanical, electrical or thermal properties. AM provides a basis for long-term innovation within UK manufacturing and in particular, the concept of 'growing' entire components offers significant benefit to the high-value manufacturing sector, based on innovative design solutions. Though AM is already cross-sectoral in nature, with the development of the multi-functional AM components envisaged comes the opportunity to engage with new product sectors, such as the optical and electrical devices industries, thus reaping the ultimate benefits and impact of this research. The current AM market place for machine tools, materials and services (such as software) is valued at just over $1-billion. However, it must also be acknowledged that as an enabling technology, AM adds the greatest value in its application, through design freedoms, production flexibility and supply chain economics. From this applications perspective (medium to long term), the opportunities of active or intelligent AM are significant and diverse and characterised by the value added to a component and potential compression of the supply chain. It is this high value added opportunity that the Centre's industrial partners want to enable, through the development of multifunctional AM processes, materials, software tools and supply chains. It can thus be seen that there will be multiple beneficiaries from the Centre's research. The Centre's partners represent a variety of end user industries - both multinational and SMEs - together with the equipment and systems manufacturers and suppliers representing the value chain. The benefits from the new technology and processes will enable new product and market opportunities in diverse manufacturing sectors, and economies in production of existing components and systems. Our early research is already being taken up by industry; the timescales for further benefits from the Centre's research will range from short (1-2 years) for results of the early industry pilots, through to the longer term (8-10) years for full realisation of multifunctional AM at the meso/micro scale. From a wider perspective, the UK will benefit through increased competitive advantage of its manufacturing industries, and the public will gain through new products at economic costs. From a societal view, the advantages AM offers in the weight reduction of multifunctional components, and the efficiencies inherent in their production, will lead to the environmental gain of lower carbon footprints - particularly in the aerospace and automotive industries.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-03-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2012-07-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>5618008</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>University of Bath</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Optimising Impact Protection Through Additive Manufacturing</gtr:description><gtr:id>ACEE9BAE-B1A7-405F-ACA9-4FE05D9220BA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The results of the projects form the basis for substantial future research, by clarifying the key challenges in the formulation parameters for optimisation for impact material.

This research also provided opportunities to widen industrial contacts and to discuss future research with companies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The project's aim was to develop a method for establishing the topologically optimized microstructure of cellular materials, for use within high strain-rate (i.e. impact) scenarios. The project brought together expertise of topology optimisation (Kim), impact materials and modelling (McShane) and experimental characterisation of impact performance (Theobald).
The objectives are listed below:
1. To develop topology optimisation for impact 
2. To determine candidate optimum material design
3. To investigate the performance of the optimum materials for impact
Topology optimisation was developed to generate optimum solutions based on the existing literature under dynamic conditions. Careful investigations revealed that the plasticity and change in loads during optimisation need to be properly accounted for in the sensitivity formulation. The resulting optimum solutions were manufactured using additive manufacturing with hyperelastic material and investigated experimentally and found to be heavier but more compliant than a benchmark polymer foam. However, optimisation did not consider maximum acceleration as a constraint, thus there is a scope for reformulating topology optimisation to deliver improved performance at reduced weight.
As a first attempt at realising cellular solution that satisfies the acceleration constraint, an analytical model was developed for an elastomeric cellular solid. This was also manufactured and tested experimentally and found to be significantly more compliant than the topologically optimised solutions. This indicates that the topological optimum solutions would not pass the acceleration criteria, further motivating the need for the revised formulation. In addition, the analytical solution was still found to underperform some established energy absorbing materials such as polymer foams. The analytical approach has a reduced design space and limits the optimum performance cellular materials can achieve. 
In conclusion, this project identified the key challenges in the topology optimisation formulation that need to be addressed to optimise materials for impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

One area that has been identified as requiring new approaches is the development of robust ceramic AM processes using materials such as ultra-high temperature ceramics, bioceramics for tissue engineering (hydroxyapatite and other calcium phosphates), or perovskites for fuel cell cathodes. 
The collaborators proposed to develop particulate material formulations that exist as a stable dispersion (initially repulsive), but aggregate upon irradiation via electrostatically driven self-assembly (surfactant reveals an attractive component upon UV irradiation). This photo-initiated gelling mechanism could be exploited to additive manufacturing of 3D structures via continuous extrusion or stereolithography. This investigation brought together researchers from the disciplines of chemistry (Dowden), and materials engineering (Claeyssens, Garcia-Tunon Blanca, Leigh, Rawson).
This project aimed to contribute to the current challenges by using a new formulation strategy. It was proposed to design and produce photo switchable surfactants that, when used with ceramic particles would initially stabilise particles suspensions but yield controlled, electrostatic self-assembly into a ceramic particle network upon UV irradiation. This photo-initiated binding mechanism can be exploited to additive manufacturing of 3D structures via continuous extrusion or stereolithography. 
Regarding continuous extrusion, the aim was to formulate a ceramic photosensitive system with low viscosity that could flow through very narrow nozzles, but could switch rheological behaviour upon UV irradiation to comply with the requirements for the 3D deposition process (stiff and strong filaments). 
To achieve this ambitious goal the project was divided into 2 distinctive work packages: (i) the synthesis of a set of bifunctional charged molecules which would able to anchor to the ceramic particle. The original concept is to decorate particles with an equal mixture of surfactants that display a permanent positive charge and photo-switchable surfactants which switch from hydrophobic to negatively charged upon irradiation with UV light (~346 nm) at pH&amp;gt;7. The release of the complementary charge is expected to lead to agglomeration of the particles. To enable this study a library of different surfactants (eight non-commercially available target compounds) were synthesised.
The produced surfactants were further evaluated on their capabilities to stabilise ceramic suspensions. This work focused on the assessment of the functionalization and attachment of the surfactants to the surface of particles and ability to bind them into a network. The particles used in the assessment were SiC, Al2O3 and SiO2 particles. We studied both glutaric acid (GA) and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA). GA was not a good dispersant for Al2O3 particles, although both GA and GBA significantly reduced the water contact angle of a surface coated with the Al2O3 particles. Wit was further studied the rheological properties of the nanoparticle/surfactant mixtures. The mixtures should ideally exhibit shear thinning behavior and should be viscoelastic, with a high elastic component. The produced mixtures exhibit shear thinning but do not have the viscoelastic behavior required for slurry extrusion.
Finally the team explored binding molecules to link the GBA and GA to the nanoparticles. The linker molecule they investigated was aminopropyltriethylsilane (APTES). This molecule is a good binding molecule for crosslinking with carboxylic acid moieties, and potential future work will be focused on covalently linking GA and GBA to the nanoparticle surfaces.
It has been identified a route to functionalise ceramic slurries so that they set via photochemical activation. This route could be applicable for a host of applications, e.g. novel filler materials for dentistry and bone defects. In this project a potential photoactive ceramic resin was investigated, and it was synthesised a photo-activated form of glutaric acid. 
Furthermore it was investigated the potential of GA and GBA as dispersants for Al2O3, SiO2 and SiC nanoparticles. Neither of the surfactant molecules acted as an appropriate dispersant of the nanoparticles. To follow on from this the team investigated the use of silanes (APTES) as a covalent linker molecule in between the nanoparticle surface and the surfactant. It was found that APTES functionalises the nanoparticle surfaces in an adequate way, and in future they will investigate covalent binding of the surfactant to the nanoparticle surface.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

The cell/material co-processing approach needs further development before publication, but conference papers and journal publications will also be prepared on the basis of this work.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>A key limitation of many biofabrication strategies for load bearing applications has been low strength and stiffness of the structures which can be created whilst co-processing cells and biomaterials. The overall aim of this project was to evaluate approaches to 3D printing of biologically functional structures which would allow for a structural biopolymer to be generated in the same processing step. 
The project was multi-disciplinary, with contributions from chemistry, biomaterials science, engineering and biology. 
The main achievements have been:
-The development of a process which allows stable bio-inks to be prepared. A piezoelectrically actuated drop-on-demand printing system (Jetlab iv) has been used to deposit electrostatically stabilised cells from a human osteosarcoma cell line (U2OS), and the effectiveness of a polyelectrolyte cell encapsulant to maintain cell dispersion within a bio ink was assessed. Cells were coated with a number of thicknesses of a cationic poly-l-lysine (PLL) encapsulant and their ability to release studied over 7 days. Results indicated the dispersion and printability of coated cells was significantly better than that of uncoated cells. It is concluded that electrostatic stabilisation of bio-inks could provide a solution to cell aggregation, increasing viable printing time and decreasing poor yields due to orifice obstruction.
-The development of a process for printing acrylate monomers and light curing them. Hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) was printed, using the Jetlab vi with a drop on demand printhead, with camphorquinone (CQ) as a photoinitiator, and a nitrogen shielding atmosphere. Blue light at 470 nm was used to cure the printed material, and 20 layers of material (0.7 mm height) have been deposited, with blue light curing under nitrogen shielding after each pass. 
-The creation of hard/soft composite biomaterial structure using a combined inkjet and microvalve approach. Using the HEMA system described above rigid 2D scaffold structures were produced which included wells for the introduction of a bio-ink analogue, the aim being to demonstrate that stacking the 2D slices could create a rigid 3D scaffold which could be pre-seeded with a bio-ink. The wells were then back filled with a blue stained, low viscosity bio-ink analogue, using a micro-valve deposition system.
The implication of this works was: 
- The ability to formulate bioprinting inks in which suspensions of cells and other biological materials can be maintained, without affecting biological response, is crucial in producing robust printing strategies for tissue engineering. The encapsulation process we have developed provides a new and potentially widely applicable approach to doing this.
- Cell/material co-processing with hard and soft materials, using processes which are scalable, opens up new possibilities in terms of the range of products and devices which can be made using a biofabrication approach. HEMA is a load bearing material commonly used in dentistry, and by showing that printing of HEMA alongside valve deposition of gels is possible the project has opened up a new route to the manufacture of cell/material composite structures, using two technologies which are automated and scalable.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

This project aimed to contribute to the current challenges by using a new formulation strategy. It was proposed to design and produce photo switchable surfactants that, when used with ceramic particles would initially stabilise particles suspensions but yield controlled, electrostatic self-assembly into a ceramic particle network upon UV irradiation. This photo-initiated binding mechanism can be exploited to additive manufacturing of 3D structures via continuous extrusion or stereolithography. 
Regarding continuous extrusion, the aim was to formulate a ceramic photosensitive system with low viscosity that could flow through very narrow nozzles, but could switch rheological behaviour upon UV irradiation to comply with the requirements for the 3D deposition process (stiff and strong filaments). 
To achieve this ambitious goal the project was divided into 2 distinctive work packages: (i) the synthesis of a set of bifunctional charged molecules which would able to anchor to the ceramic particle. The original concept is to decorate particles with an equal mixture of surfactants that display a permanent positive charge and photo-switchable surfactants which switch from hydrophobic to negatively charged upon irradiation with UV light (~346 nm) at pH&amp;gt;7. The release of the complementary charge is expected to lead to agglomeration of the particles. To enable this study a library of different surfactants (eight non-commercially available target compounds) were synthesised.
The produced surfactants were further evaluated on their capabilities to stabilise ceramic suspensions. This work focused on the assessment of the functionalization and attachment of the surfactants to the surface of particles and ability to bind them into a network. The particles used in the assessment were SiC, Al2O3 and SiO2 particles. We studied both glutaric acid (GA) and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA). GA was not a good dispersant for Al2O3 particles, although both GA and GBA significantly reduced the water contact angle of a surface coated with the Al2O3 particles. Wit was further studied the rheological properties of the nanoparticle/surfactant mixtures. The mixtures should ideally exhibit shear thinning behavior and should be viscoelastic, with a high elastic component. The produced mixtures exhibit shear thinning but do not have the viscoelastic behavior required for slurry extrusion.
Finally the team explored binding molecules to link the GBA and GA to the nanoparticles. The linker molecule they investigated was aminopropyltriethylsilane (APTES). This molecule is a good binding molecule for crosslinking with carboxylic acid moieties, and potential future work will be focused on covalently linking GA and GBA to the nanoparticle surfaces.
It has been identified a route to functionalise ceramic slurries so that they set via photochemical activation. This route could be applicable for a host of applications, e.g. novel filler materials for dentistry and bone defects. In this project a potential photoactive ceramic resin was investigated, and it was synthesised a photo-activated form of glutaric acid. 
Furthermore it was investigated the potential of GA and GBA as dispersants for Al2O3, SiO2 and SiC nanoparticles. Neither of the surfactant molecules acted as an appropriate dispersant of the nanoparticles. To follow on from this the team investigated the use of silanes (APTES) as a covalent linker molecule in between the nanoparticle surface and the surfactant. It was found that APTES functionalises the nanoparticle surfaces in an adequate way, and in future they will investigate covalent binding of the surfactant to the nanoparticle surface.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

This research also provided opportunities to widen industrial contacts and to discuss future research with companies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The project's aim was to develop a method for establishing the topologically optimized microstructure of cellular materials, for use within high strain-rate (i.e. impact) scenarios. The project brought together expertise of topology optimisation (Kim), impact materials and modelling (McShane) and experimental characterisation of impact performance (Theobald).
The objectives are listed below:
1. To develop topology optimisation for impact 
2. To determine candidate optimum material design
3. To investigate the performance of the optimum materials for impact
Topology optimisation was developed to generate optimum solutions based on the existing literature under dynamic conditions. Careful investigations revealed that the plasticity and change in loads during optimisation need to be properly accounted for in the sensitivity formulation. The resulting optimum solutions were manufactured using additive manufacturing with hyperelastic material and investigated experimentally and found to be heavier but more compliant than a benchmark polymer foam. However, optimisation did not consider maximum acceleration as a constraint, thus there is a scope for reformulating topology optimisation to deliver improved performance at reduced weight.
As a first attempt at realising cellular solution that satisfies the acceleration constraint, an analytical model was developed for an elastomeric cellular solid. This was also manufactured and tested experimentally and found to be significantly more compliant than the topologically optimised solutions. This indicates that the topological optimum solutions would not pass the acceleration criteria, further motivating the need for the revised formulation. In addition, the analytical solution was still found to underperform some established energy absorbing materials such as polymer foams. The analytical approach has a reduced design space and limits the optimum performance cellular materials can achieve. 
In conclusion, this project identified the key challenges in the topology optimisation formulation that need to be addressed to optimise materials for impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

To achieve this ambitious goal the project was divided into 2 distinctive work packages: (i) the synthesis of a set of bifunctional charged molecules which would able to anchor to the ceramic particle. The original concept is to decorate particles with an equal mixture of surfactants that display a permanent positive charge and photo-switchable surfactants which switch from hydrophobic to negatively charged upon irradiation with UV light (~346 nm) at pH&amp;gt;7. The release of the complementary charge is expected to lead to agglomeration of the particles. To enable this study a library of different surfactants (eight non-commercially available target compounds) were synthesised.
The produced surfactants were further evaluated on their capabilities to stabilise ceramic suspensions. This work focused on the assessment of the functionalization and attachment of the surfactants to the surface of particles and ability to bind them into a network. The particles used in the assessment were SiC, Al2O3 and SiO2 particles. We studied both glutaric acid (GA) and guanidinobutyric acid (GBA). GA was not a good dispersant for Al2O3 particles, although both GA and GBA significantly reduced the water contact angle of a surface coated with the Al2O3 particles. Wit was further studied the rheological properties of the nanoparticle/surfactant mixtures. The mixtures should ideally exhibit shear thinning behavior and should be viscoelastic, with a high elastic component. The produced mixtures exhibit shear thinning but do not have the viscoelastic behavior required for slurry extrusion.
Finally the team explored binding molecules to link the GBA and GA to the nanoparticles. The linker molecule they investigated was aminopropyltriethylsilane (APTES). This molecule is a good binding molecule for crosslinking with carboxylic acid moieties, and potential future work will be focused on covalently linking GA and GBA to the nanoparticle surfaces.
It has been identified a route to functionalise ceramic slurries so that they set via photochemical activation. This route could be applicable for a host of applications, e.g. novel filler materials for dentistry and bone defects. In this project a potential photoactive ceramic resin was investigated, and it was synthesised a photo-activated form of glutaric acid. 
Furthermore it was investigated the potential of GA and GBA as dispersants for Al2O3, SiO2 and SiC nanoparticles. Neither of the surfactant molecules acted as an appropriate dispersant of the nanoparticles. To follow on from this the team investigated the use of silanes (APTES) as a covalent linker molecule in between the nanoparticle surface and the surfactant. It was found that APTES functionalises the nanoparticle surfaces in an adequate way, and in future they will investigate covalent binding of the surfactant to the nanoparticle surface.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

This research also provided opportunities to widen industrial contacts and to discuss future research with companies.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>The project's aim was to develop a method for establishing the topologically optimized microstructure of cellular materials, for use within high strain-rate (i.e. impact) scenarios. The project brought together expertise of topology optimisation (Kim), impact materials and modelling (McShane) and experimental characterisation of impact performance (Theobald).
The objectives are listed below:
1. To develop topology optimisation for impact 
2. To determine candidate optimum material design
3. To investigate the performance of the optimum materials for impact
Topology optimisation was developed to generate optimum solutions based on the existing literature under dynamic conditions. Careful investigations revealed that the plasticity and change in loads during optimisation need to be properly accounted for in the sensitivity formulation. The resulting optimum solutions were manufactured using additive manufacturing with hyperelastic material and investigated experimentally and found to be heavier but more compliant than a benchmark polymer foam. However, optimisation did not consider maximum acceleration as a constraint, thus there is a scope for reformulating topology optimisation to deliver improved performance at reduced weight.
As a first attempt at realising cellular solution that satisfies the acceleration constraint, an analytical model was developed for an elastomeric cellular solid. This was also manufactured and tested experimentally and found to be significantly more compliant than the topologically optimised solutions. This indicates that the topological optimum solutions would not pass the acceleration criteria, further motivating the need for the revised formulation. In addition, the analytical solution was still found to underperform some established energy absorbing materials such as polymer foams. The analytical approach has a reduced design space and limits the optimum performance cellular materials can achieve. 
In conclusion, this project identified the key challenges in the topology optimisation formulation that need to be addressed to optimise materials for impact.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

Two different approaches designed to control and understand the deposition of metals for a 3D printing application have been developed initially. In the first system there have been employed an IR laser coupled to an electrode through a fibre optic cable. This study has shown that reductions in the uncompensated resistance of an electrode was possible through laser excitation of the system. In addition this local heating effect was shown to enhance the rate of mass transfer of material to an electrode surface. These effects were beneficial to the development of a fibre coupled electrodeposition system. Deployment of the system within a flowing jet system was also investigated. Under the conditions employed, heating effects were minimal suggesting that further refinement of the system is necessary. In the second system we developed a 'hot jet' plating system. This was found to improve plating rates and hence the potential speed at which a deposit could be generated. This technique in tandem with a thorough understanding of the electrochemical cell within this environment shows promise as a versatile and cheap technology for the electrodeposition of 3D structures on a suitable substrate. This technique was able to produce rapid growth of an electrodeposit on the surface of an electrode.
The work has shown that electrodeposition under appropriate control and with careful experimental design is a versatile technology for the deposition of many different materials. This is not limited to materials with the ability to directly absorb laser light (e.g. 514 nm as described in the literature), but other highly reflecting materials. This is as a result of the novel approaches adopted where either the solvent is locally heated through the careful choice of laser wavelength and fibre optic technology or a hot jet approach where the liquid in the jet is rapidly heated and then ejected onto the electrode surface. Both of these approaches shows significant promise and require further investigation. In addition structures have been deposited at rates approaching those reported in the literature. However, the added versatility and simplicity of the new techniques suggest that these approaches show significant promise.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

The specific objectives were to:
-determine if in-situ flash x-ray imaging can be used to monitor powder bed melting and the generation of gas bubbles and pores within the melt pool;
-investigate discrete element method modelling to simulate the powder spreading in the SLM process and the effect of powder morphology on packing density variability;
-use ex-situ high resolution x-ray tomography to characterise the powder packing in the bed and the retained defects in melted layers, to support the experiments and modelling.
As the feasibility study was of a relatively short duration, the emphasis was on discovering the potential of combining the higher risk in-situ imaging experiments with the lower risk modelling and ex-situ validation.
The project has been very useful for the project partners to apply their existing research expertise in this new area and learn about the capabilities of the other partners for possible future AM research. The open-architecture powder bed platform developed by Heriot-Watt could potentially prove very valuable for a range of experiments that involve in-situ monitoring of the build process, or that involve work with non-standard laser parameters or materials. For example, the ISIS neutron source has an interest in the additive manufacturing of neutron-absorbing materials such as boron, and in-situ neutron measurement of the variation in residual stress during the build process.</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Under the terms of the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing, the Centre is entitled to support research activities external to the Centre, either at other AM Centred research groups or for supporting activity in other fields.

The workshop series consisted of two face-to-face workshops with senior researchers and staff from the EPSRC Centre for Innovative Manufacturing in Additive Manufacturing. In between the face-to-face sessions, participants completed a set of inter-session tasks.
The chosen underpinning method and discovery philosophy for this workshop series was Appreciative Inquiry, a proven and well-documented method for studying and learning from the positive example.
Through their discussions about their own observations and data collected from their interviews the individual participants gained increased understanding of:
- Examples of creative approaches in action
- Examples of outstanding positive research impact
- Examples of great collaboration and inter-disciplinary efforts
- The enabling factors of all of these examples



Based on the shared conclusions, the participants prepared a final presentation with a set of recommendations. These recommendations included:
? How to improve methods for internal information sharing
? Establishing new both formal and informal meeting routines
? Continued education of the teams in specific creativity enhancing techniques such as &amp;quot;Six Thinking Hats
? How to pay better attention to and learn when a creativity mind-set vs. an innovation mind-set is appropriate
In addition to these takeaways and concrete actions, the chosen approach and content were in themselves example of innovative approaches and hence participants gained a first-hand experience of trying out and learning from using relatively novel approach and concepts.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Participants in your research and patient groups</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2013</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Appointment of Dr Chris Tuck as a Panel Member of the EPSRC Early Career Forum in Manufacturing Research</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>9ABDE055-B9CE-40C7-8A72-D720B6389249</gtr:id><gtr:impact>In July 2012 Dr Chris Tuck was appointed as a Panel Member of the EPSRC Early Career Forum in Manufacturing Research.

Its focus is on making connections for students and early years researchers to help their careers. 
2-3 national conferences are organised every year related to printing technologies. Usually 20-30 speakers present in each of the conferences throughout the conference period. Various topics are selected as themes for the conferences, ranging from specialised topics like Plastic Electronics printing to more generalised topics like Printing the Future conference.
The most common outcome from those conferences is exchanging scientific knowledge and making new contacts from the printing community. There has been a few discussions about building some future collaboration especially amongst the committee members.
