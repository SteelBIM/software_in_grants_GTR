Despite the tremendous connections that are made through shopping experiences on the internet, the high street remains locked in a 19th Century paradigm in which the cash register is the only interface between material goods, the customer and the stock inventory (database) (Carrier 1995). Shoppers work hard to make their own connections between disconnected shops, salespeople are reduced to scanning barcodes or fixing self-checkout machines, and data between all parties remains in silos. The vision of a 'frictionless shopping experience' (Brynjofsson and Smith 2000) that part an Internet of Things promise (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xNhL39uD7I), in which technology can reduce the bottleneck of the cash register is far from being realised, instead shoppers have turned to 'showrooming' to make their lives easier (Campbell 2013).

This timely project explores the potential for reconfiguring the traditional organisation of customer, salesperson, cash register, tangible things and database, allowing shops 'stacks' of both immaterial and material processes to share data that will improve social and economic conditions. That high streets are in trouble is documented by the Portas Review (2011), which describes the impact that internet shopping, out of town shopping centres and the economic downturn have had upon on these spaces of social, economic and environmental exchange (see Miller 1998). One ramification is decreased employment opportunities for local young people. This year the Grimsey Review (2013) offered a deeper 'digital' critique of the state of the High Street, embracing a Digitally Economic perspective &amp;quot;To strengthen the high street, we need to increase the number of mutual connections between the nodes or network participants (retail, services, local government, job centres and all others). The more mutual connections, the more adaptive the high street network becomes in response to changes in the success of individuals shops and services.&amp;quot; (Grimsey 2013:17). 

Our project builds on research and innovation that NCR Consumer Experience (Cx) have initiated in response to the advent of ubiquitous computing in which every shopper carries a cash register in the form of a smart phone. Equipped with a suite of applications, shoppers are able to make purchases, compare prices, track goods, acquire vouchers and group together with friends or strangers to get better deals, all contributing to the consumers range of tactics to make the most from the high street. This project aims to use this sophisticated user knowledge to inform new models for interaction with physical artefacts and their connected data, to improve the high street experience and recover values and relationships that are core to shopping.

The research partnership is completed through the investigators expertise and experience in handling the remaining vital component in the context of the connected high street: things. The extraordinary number of products available in a typical high street at any one time is a material manifestation of the big databases and shop inventories that are connected to each thing. Making visible the scale of the goods in the high street to the shopper, through patterns, correlations and recommendations is a critical step in developing a more connected high street. Through a better understanding of how this data can support the shopper and the salesperson to connect 'things that want to be together', new models of shopping will emerge and reinvigorate the role of things, people and architectures. This Internet of Things project is firmly located within a tenet that the re-thinking of things, data and people might unpack and ameliorate established practices.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Primary impact aims:
We aim to provide networked and physical prototypes co-designed by high street users, providing a springboard for the high street to change from a retail space to a connected retail space that will have resonance for 10-50 years. New models of social economy will encourage more people to shop on high street, potentially reviving local economies. By enhancing the social capital of the high street we aim to provide new forms of social engagement with the potential to change how people use the high street. We will respond to the well-documented social and economic problems facing UK high streets by aiming to provide new models and practices that will inform government policy. 

In-project impacts:
The primary impact objective for the collaboration is to extend NCR's technical design portfolio with prototypes for new shopping experiences. NCR are world leaders in point of sale technologies and as the high street transforms they require strategies that open up new market opportunities. The proposed project benefits from being closely associated with Dr. Rogers at Dundee who has worked closely with NCR Research through projects and supervision of PhD students. The second objective is to develop truly user-led solutions toward an Internet of Things. Given the amount of material 'things' and immaterial data that is in the high street, the project focus offers an apt context in which to develop co-designed solutions through ethnographic engagement with participants. The third objective is to develop tangible prototypes that demonstrate the potential for connected high streets that are in direct response to both the Portas Review and the &amp;quot;Digitally Economic&amp;quot; perspective offered by the Grimsey Review. 

Enhancing quality of life: 
'As broadband and 4G continue to &amp;quot;collapse the distance&amp;quot;, we are free to ignore the constraints of the past and the notion that physical space is necessary for shopping. We can find a path with new technologies to create the best combination of both physical and virtual shopping through the hybrid high street. This considers the need for convenience and value, but also for the social aspect of face-to-face communing' (Grimsey 2013).The project aims to develop sensitive solutions that are led by users and not by the apparent promise of new technology, seeking to redress this balance and enhancing the quality of the shopping experience through creative design methods. 

Ensure users contribute to and gain from the project:
The project requires the involvement of high street shoppers and salespeople. The project's team benefits from experience in parallel domains of recruitment and retention with community members (e.g. work in the past with Oxfam managers, staff and shoppers etc.) Given the project is committed to exploring user-led shopping opportunities between objects and data, the pathways to impact will be informed by studies of interaction and engagement, an approach which casts a wider net over what an Internet of Things for the high street might be. We will develop 'pop-up' demonstrations in shopping contexts to expose the prototypes to parties beyond the participatory group. The pop-up events will provide material for documenting and disseminating the ideas to wider communities and will provide key content for conference and exhibition applications. We will design web and print publicity material to be used from the start of the project and will utilise contemporary social media supported by illustrations, photographs and videos to document the innovations and effect of the research. Professional and public institutions (such as the Pro Retail conference, Independent Retail Show, SXSW and the Internet of Things Council events) will be used to disseminate our findings and communicate with non-academic communities. The team has strong links with media channels including BBC Digital Human, New Scientist and WIRED magazine to support the dissemination of key ideas.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2016-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-08-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>306871</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Millennial 20/20 Summit invited speaker, Victoria House, London</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>E0D59DFA-D20E-45B5-8069-CFD903BF1528</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to talk about work relating to Internet of Things, Connected High Street and Tales of Things.

The Millennial 20/20 Summits focus at a unique time in the industry, where large and small businesses are dealing with a more-complex and ever-evolving consumer that requires them to think of innovation, disruption and technology as key components of their future.

The European Consumer Summit is an annual forum gathering key European and international policy-makers and stakeholders, including representatives from the European Parliament, governments and national authorities, consumer organisations, academia and business. Over the years, the European Consumer Summit has become a valuable occasion to increase awareness on consumer policy and a key tool to mainstream consumer interests in EU policies. This 2015 edition of the Consumer Summit will be dedicated to &amp;quot;Shaping the consumer policy of the future&amp;quot;. The focus will be on the most topical consumer policy issues which link with the political priorities of the European Commission led by President Juncker.

Design from/with/by Data

The complex constellations of personal and shared devices that are connected to everyday practices that involve the transmission of data constitute openings to new markets in which different kinds of value are exchanged. In many cases we are becoming attuned to understanding how value is constructed as we use software: social media users are becoming aware of the many pros and cons of exchanging social values in Facebook, while Trip Advisor users understand the implications of their liking, disliking and commenting upon the economic values of hotels. However, as websites and apps become replaced by objects that we use in everyday life, such as making tea, taking a shower or getting on the bus, it is less clear how the flow of data that is derived from our interactions, constructs value and is 'traded' between services. This disjuncture in the flow of value - with and without humans in the loop - presents both opportunities and threats to people and institutions. This paper will explore the implications of emerging ecosystems and an agenda for designing human data interactions, that goes beyond the organization and understanding of data, toward the development of platforms that balance the values of all stakeholders within complex digital economic systems to offer a level of commensurability with a service.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=york-hci;9eb9c625.1603</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Presentation to the Gartner Research Board</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>015A6D25-9A15-4C62-816E-B0366B9EC4D8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Invited to present research across a series of projects to the Gartner Research Board.

Design pop-up at Digital Catapult, May/June 2016.
Workshop at Design in the City, Amsterdam. April 2016.
Designing Interactive Systems conference, Brisbane, June 2016.

In addition to these dissemination events, the primary meeting is an opportunity to report back to NCR in Dundee to describe what the suite of design interventions has elicited in terms of findings. At this point in the project (March 2016) we are currently collating findings in to a small book for distribution through relevant networks.
We will report on the following areas:
? The potential benefits of allowing the public to donate unwanted loyalty card points as a means of involving them further within data value constellations.
? How a user-centred perspective on transgressive or positive deviant practices can provide insight into shopping habits.
? How small boutique shops can benefit from local area networks.
? How interactive design products that identify and evoke personal associations with media can foster greater attachment to products.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2016</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>CC879F0B-3C28-41E4-8558-9EAE7699DEA5</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal,Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Although the project has completed its core research the team are still using design events to understand the findings. This is a typical Research Through Design approach in which participation is central to understanding the research. 
Demonstrations of prototypes at the &amp;quot;Connected Nation: Thriving in a Digital World&amp;quot; led to very positive engagement toward understanding the benefits of two research activities: donating data and the role of historical data in informing attachment to purchases. Speed's invitation and presentation at the European Consumer Summit, Shaping the Consumer Policy of the Future made considerable impact in raising awareness of the need to design data interactions for the digital economy (Speed 2015). Invited talks and publications in press discussed the implications of distributed ledgers on the High Street (Speed 2016 forthcoming). The Reciprociti exhibition at the high street branch of Royal Bank of Scotland, Princes Street, Edinburgh attracted the attention of many visitors to the role of design within new banking models. The Dark Play seminar whilst focusing upon children provided the opportunity to introduce research about shoplifting in order to better understand how the design process can explore dark practices (2015). The paper presentation at the DE 2015 conference provided a first paper to reveal early findings surrounding the use of local area networks with shops and donating data (team 2015).


A series of 3 primary studies have demonstrated core questions for the design community. 



Across the role of transgressive practices:
1. Reflections on new normativeness. Current interactive systems rely on models of shopping remaining the same. They perpetuate these models at the same time. Shopping and the social norms that characterise it are continually changing. 

2. Questioning context awareness. Consider more anonymous ways to interact with a service. Does a system really need to know everything about you? Leave space for people to invent their own identities or develop multiple ones. 

3. Rethink payment. Shopping rules are becoming more fuzzy. Selling is not everything. Drawing attention to brand or product is becoming more critical. Perhaps we could consider more flexible even social ways to pay. Perhaps even explore ways to distribute wealth. 

4. Design beyond economic values. Existing interactive systems tend toward improving economic efficiencies. How can design identify other values across the high street that will lead to rewarding experiences for both the shop and the shopper? Consider designing for trust, rather than designing out crime.
5. Rethink narratives of the future. &amp;nbsp;What roles will the high street perform if we can no longer purchase goods in the quantity that we are doing currently? How can design rethink social and cultural models of consumption in tune with what it means to be human, rather than what it means to sell goods?

Across the role of data within High Street activities:
1. The study explored the complications that people face as they become entangled in the schemes and how people make sense of them. How cards, and the accounts that they are associated with, are shared between friends and family that reveal dynamics as people have the power to spend the reward points. 
2. As the study moved toward understanding the role of personal information and data capture, opinions became more divided as some participants expressed cynical views on why personal data was involved, whilst others were disappointed that not more was done from the data. 
3. The study and use of the design proposition to expand the relationship between a supermarket and the shopper to involve a charity, revealed a series of implications for interaction design. The implications anticipate how the discipline should prepare to tackle the sensitivities of working with data across networks that involves parties with different values, and how to help people understand how their data will gain or lose value it becomes inseparable from others in the network.
Across the subject of how we buy for other people the following design questions were arrived at:
1. How might design better use data that is accrued through our interactions with friends and family to manifest values from which we would be better informed to make value judgements? How could a collaborative gifting platform allow networks of 'givers' and 'recipients' mediate value in such a way that the values shared by a group are manifest?
2. What might a 'design of time' (i.e. time rather than money as a measure of affection) as a gift be like, that was more sensitive than a gifted experience (spa day or trip in a balloon) and didn't involve any financial transaction?
3. How can design develop in-store or pan high-street interventions that better support spaces for those who want to revel in the seasonal cheer, whilst helping others navigate to products that they are struggling to discover? How can design reduce peak moments but allow people to linger and reflect in the moment of purchase?

As we move to disseminate these insights we will publish them through a variety of contexts.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>We anticipate that as the findings are formally published through a variety of channels, that the implications for the research will be substantial. A book will be produced for digital and analogue consumption that will spell out the findings for different audiences.
Anticipated sectors of influence include:
Supermarkets and the use of consumer data.
Boutique and bespoke businesses.
Retail strategies for helping consumers shop for others.
Reducing friction within retail environments.
Use of new digital currencies within retail.
Better understanding for positive deviant practices.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>6C3F2CA1-5AEC-446F-AF46-D2BC3409B0DA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Creative Economy,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Retail</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.theconnectedhighstreet.co.uk</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/A38294E2-BC1F-4550-A49E-739235659A20"><gtr:id>A38294E2-BC1F-4550-A49E-739235659A20</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring incentivisation in design</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9"><gtr:id>96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Speed C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/AE1175AA-441A-4939-9192-A4421B5157C0"><gtr:id>AE1175AA-441A-4939-9192-A4421B5157C0</gtr:id><gtr:title>Exploring incentivisation in design</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9"><gtr:id>96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Speed C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>9781450325424</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/FA210128-A7FB-42C2-AC82-65EC1338F86E"><gtr:id>FA210128-A7FB-42C2-AC82-65EC1338F86E</gtr:id><gtr:title>Designing through value constellations</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>interactions</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9"><gtr:id>96fcbbe2d33ccb220dec4665404431c9</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Speed C</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">EP/L02358X/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>EB5F16BB-2772-4DDE-BD6C-3B7A6914B64C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>100</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Info. &amp; commun.
