The proposed research has a strong focus on industrial needs by integrating with the industrial partner's existing activities for developing CCS technologies suitable for commercial gas power plants. E.ON is generating around 10% of the UK's electricity and is committed to reducing its CO2 emission by 50% by 2030 (1990 baseline). E.ON has setup a dedicated CCS unit to address the technical challenges while one of the priorities is to develop CCS technologies suitable for natural gas power stations. This research specifically targets at natural gas power plants, which has a lower concentration of CO2 approx. 4% compared to 13% from coal-fired plants, and harder to extract, representing the most challenging case for CCS.

Carbon capture and storage involves separating the CO2 from emissions so it can be transported and stored away from the atmosphere. The most commercially viable approach to be fitted in natural gas power plants is the post-combustion capture which absorbs CO2 from the flue gas using a chemical reaction - also known as scrubbing, which E.ON has been actively pursuing and will be the focus of this research. Whilst research on the chemical processes has been taking place for several decades, CFD modelling of the reactor is a recent development. E.ON has recognised that CFD plays a vital role in the optimisation of current CCS reactors by including more CFD research in their future research strategy. University of Southampton is a prime place for CFD based research while the School of Engineering Sciences currently holds &amp;pound;5M CFD focused EPSRC projects. The combined expertise forms a strong academic and industrial partnership to tackle current barriers of reactor scale-up in carbon capture using advanced CFD models. 

By addressing all the challenges outlined in te EPSRC call, this research aims to design an optimised reactor using a novel CFD modelling approach that is capable of achieving in excess of 90% CO2 absorption whilst ensuring the cost of service energy is minimised to below 35%. The new concept idea will incorporate improved mixing designs and improved heat transfer whilst reducing reactor size. It is planned through the enhancement of current CFD multiphase models to incorporate reaction and the inclusion of flow control devices that an optimal structured packing arrangement, which promotes the reaction process whilst reducing pressure drop, can be found. This project will not only produce conceptual ideas developed through enhance CFD methods but will also perform tests, in a lab-scale reactor, to determine its validity with respect to its flow dynamics and would potentially lead to the production of intellectual property.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Electricity generation is the largest source of CO2 emissions in the UK and currently represents a third of total emissions. This research has the potential for a very large impact on society by developing a cost-effective technology for the reduction of CO2 emission from power plants.
 In general aspect, amine scrubbing has the potential for wide applications. It can be utilised in both pre- and post-combustion technologies, suitable to new and existing plants. Furthermore, it is adaptive to the emissions from different fuel reactors, i.e., natural gas, coal, biomass etc., and also different conversion techniques such as gasification and combustion. Therefore, the outcome of this project would be applied for a variety of conversion technologies which are already being utilised in the energy sector throughout the UK and also worldwide. 
 In technology aspect, counter-current absorbers and stripper configurations are also used for other chemical processes such as the production of ammonia. This process is vital for the formation of amine solutions which is used during the carbon capturing process. Therefore, the optimised absorber design could be extended to this process which would further reduce the costs and improve efficiencies over a wider range of the carbon capturing process beginning with solvent production. 
 In the modelling aspect, the code to be developed will be the state-of-the-art with the incorporation of multiple phases into periodic modelling which is currently not available. Furthermore, reactions will be enabled to allow for mass transfer between phases to account for the absorption processes that take place in the reactor. Demonstrating such modelling capabilities will not only enhance research in the modelling of carbon capture but also other processes that exhibit a strong reactive behaviour. Successful application of these advance models demonstrates the capabilities of CFD and its ability to aid engineering design, process optimisation and technology breakthrough for industry.

This project enables the formation of a close partnership between the University of Southampton and E.ON, so technologies developed can be explored commercially in the UK and knowledge gained can be shared around the world. The investigators have extensive experience in Industrial CASE Award, KTP, TSB and EU projects with industrial partners such as BOC, Praxair and Air Liquide, etc. In relevant clean energy research, we have been working closely with Lurgi (a leading technology provider for gas cleaning and CCS technologies) and involved in their research and development of advanced coal gasification plants in China. In South Africa, we are working with Sasol (a leading company in commercialization of clean coal technologies) in EPSRC energy research (EPSRC EP/G034281/1) project. In this new project, we will continue to identify appropriate mechanism for industrial collaborations according to industrial and technical requirements.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2017-11-11</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C"><gtr:id>798CB33D-C79E-4578-83F2-72606407192C</gtr:id><gtr:name>EPSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2015-09-12</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>227091</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Norwegian University of Science and Technology</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>Norway, Kingdom of</gtr:country><gtr:department>Department of Chemical Engineering</gtr:department><gtr:description>Collaboration with Norwegian University of Science and Technology</gtr:description><gtr:id>738FD72F-954D-4E7F-989C-1A6BA7212204</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Conference paper is prepared</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>To provide experimental facilities for our researchers to carry out solution based carbon capture</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>We provide process system modelling for post-combustion carbon capture</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput></gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participate in CCS in the bigger picture - Cambridge Biannual, 2-3 April 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>865C08C9-85EA-4DA7-9A8E-C152A2A638C8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Give presentation about our CCS project to about 50 audience</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participate in Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT) Austin, Texas (US) 5-9 October 2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>D7023E4C-1E36-46E5-8B9D-31BCD366D105</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Give presentation &amp;quot;Computational modelling and optimisation of carbon capture reactors&amp;quot; in the largest CCS conference with 500 audience.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description> Participate 8th &quot;Trondheim Conference on CO2 Capture, Transport and Storage&quot; was held June 16 - 18, 2015, in Trondheim, Norway.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>EE4E1622-9A7F-475A-AFA9-EB3C666D859E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Over 300 participants in the conference, post presentation about our CCS project, established collaboration with SINTEC and Norwegian University of Science and Technology</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Professional Practitioners</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/tccs-8/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Participate Process Simulation Conference&amp;Training, Madrid	16-28/09/2014</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>BC27EE1A-5924-4FDD-A053-E6EA287F2E1C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Post presentation in the conference and attend the training session for process simulation, good interactions with industrial engineers</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Industry/Business</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Organize European Carbon Capture &amp; Storage Research and Development Workshop in Cranfield University</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>373F4FC0-955C-4697-8651-3A18553EA4C7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>15 Speakers from the leading UK and EU CCS groups gave presentations.

We have successfully developed micro-scale model for interaction between gas and liquid film on the packing surface including mass transfer and chemical reactions. A series of papers are published and presented in major international conferences. The multi-scale model has been used by industrial partners for design and process optimisation.
We developed a novel method to encapsulate capture solvents with polymer cells. This will remove the direct contacts between solvents (MEA) with reactors. The new materials have a property of liquid, but behave like solids. We are exploring the use of encapsulated solvent technologies with industrial partners for application in domestic and industrial environments. An Innovate UK Energy Catalyst grant was won to use the CO2 capture technology for in-door air quality control.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>556D7CF2-464B-4E7D-A558-6A5A79A50E1E</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>Microscale model based on volume of fluid (VOF) method was developed to capture the interaction between gas and liquid film on packing surface as well as chemical reaction and heat transfer. Mescoscale model has been developed for a representative unit of packing column to capture the gas-liquid interaction. Macroscale reactor model has been developed including mass and heat transfers.
VOF (volume of fluid) CFD model is suitable for micro- and meso- scale simulation to accurately capture the film spreading, gas-liquid interaction with heat/mass transfer and chemical reaction. The meso-scale model can be used for optimisation of design and operational parameters. The main challenge is for macro-scale simulation where VOF model cannot be used due to extensive computing costs. On the other hand, Eulerian two phase model has its limitation without the detailed gas-liquid interface.
Encapsulated solvents with microfluidic process provide attractive options to reduce the size of the reactors due to much larger surface area. The permeable polymer cells allow gas passing through while keeping liquid out. The new materials have a property of solvents but can be handled like solid. The new CO2 capture materials can be used in fluidised bed reactors to greatly reduce the size of structure packing in the reactors. Further research is required to found the suitable polymer for solvents like MEA.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The multi-scale CO2 capture model can be used for both academic and industrial partners.
