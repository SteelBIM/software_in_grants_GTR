Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/K006932/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>Sustainability is a disputed term and concept, interpreted and imagined differently according to local urban contexts and histories. Although the term is used extensively across academia, professional and popular debate, there are often conflicting and contradictory understandings, creating a barrier to wider adoption of 'sustainable development' strategies. Meanwhile, although environmentalism and climate change are established areas of interest in the fine art field more complex meanings and understandings of sustainability have not been fully explored within urban public art practice. As an interdisciplinary project that connects the debates of fine art and urban design, Jetty investigates how a contemporary public artwork can meaningfully contribute to the reshaping of this multi-layered debate. The project is developed as a collaboration between artist Wolfgang Weileder based at Newcastle University School of Arts and Culture, and urbanist Simon Guy, Director of the Architecture Research Centre at the University of Manchester, with additional project partners from the arts, heritage, education and business community.

At the heart of the Jetty project is the creation of a temporary large-scale architectural artwork integrated within the impressive wooden structure of Dunston Staithes, a landmark Scheduled Monument and Grade II structure on the south bank of the River Tyne in NewcastleGateshead. 
In developing the project the academic partners will work closely with Tyne and Wear Preservation Trust, the owner of Dunston Staithes as part of its initiative to provide a long-term and sustainable future for the structure. The artwork will be constructed in collaboration with trainees and specialist staff from Newcastle College Construction Skills Academy and RBAU Sunderland, providing an innovative opportunity for skills exchange for the benefit of young people entering the construction industry.
Throughout its development and exhibition the Jetty artwork will be utilised as a catalyst for research and debate into local and professional meanings, interpretations and understandings of sustainability. Activity will focus on three distinct communities of interest considered to be at the centre of this discussion: the artistic community, including artists, commissioners and curators; urban professionals, including landscape and urban designers, architects, planners and policy makers; and members of the geographic community of NewcastleGateshead, including residents, community and local interest groups. Involvement of these groups will be achieved through a combination of focus groups, individual interviews, an international symposium, online activity, and as audiences for the public exhibition of the artwork.

The knowledge gained through this project will be widely disseminated to local, national and international audiences via a range of activities including: the site-specific installation at Dunston Staithes; the Jetty project website; an interdisciplinary symposium hosted by BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead; publication of the Jetty book; co-authoring of academic articles for high-impact and relevant research journals; presentations at national and international conferences for artistic and urban professional communities. 

As a research project and case study, Jetty will benefit academics and practitioners working within the fine art, urbanism and heritage fields, providing new insights into the meanings, understanding and implications of sustainability across these different sectors. Through engagement with local communities and audiences in NewcastleGateshead Jetty will contribute to the cultural and social regeneration of the city, promoting it as a site for sustainable arts practice.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Beyond its academic beneficiaries Jetty will impact on three main communities of interest. These are broadly categorised as: (1) Artistic, including artists, commissioners, galleries, critics; (2) Urban professionals, including landscape and urban designers, architects, construction companies, training providers, and policy makers; (3) Geographic, including local residents, community groups, and arts audiences.

In what ways will the Jetty research project have cultural, social and economic impact on these communities?

(1) Artistic community:

1. Jetty will create a better understanding of sustainability issues in contemporary arts practice, stimulating further discussion and debate that will influence the development and realisation of future fine art projects and research.
2. Through its association with the Jetty project Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead will attract new audiences and develop its reputation in relation to sustainable contemporary arts practice. 
3. Jetty will create a cross-disciplinary exchange between the arts, local community, urban professionals and public agencies.
4. Jetty will contribute to the sustainable cultural regeneration of the city of NewcastleGateshead, promoting it as a site for sustainable arts practice.

(2) Geographic community:

1. Audiences in NewcastleGateshead and the wider region will gain access to a new and high quality cultural experience through the public exhibition of the Jetty artwork. 
2. Jetty will provide new temporary public access to Dunstan Staithes (the site for the Jetty artwork) and will highlight and test new regenerative uses for the structure directly benefiting local community and residents of NewcastleGateshead.
3. Jetty will raise the public profile of the Staithes as a heritage structure and through this will raise public awareness of the Tyne and Wear Building Preservation Trust and its important cultural and environmental role in conserving and regenerating local heritage.
4. The Jetty artwork will enhance community cohesion and quality of life by providing a new recreational and social facility for use by local residents and community groups and in doing so will provide a catalyst for the local community to reconsider connections between local identity and public heritage.
5. The project will have an impact on local people and organisations in NewcastleGateshead by involving them directly in the investigation and discussion of sustainability issues through engagement with the Jetty artwork and the research process (e.g. focus groups, symposium).

(3) Urban professionals:

1. The Jetty project will generate new connections between the professional construction industry and higher and further education organisations.
2. Jetty will provide a platform for innovative forms of skills exchange, developing the practical knowledge of participating construction trainees from Newcastle Construction Skills Academy and enhancing their future employment opportunities.
3. Jetty will contribute to professional and public policy discussions around the complex issues of sustainability and its application within the urban context.
4. The Jetty project will provide a high profile test-bed for sustainable construction methods and materials and will raise industry awareness and understanding of sustainability issues, and their varied applicability according to place.
5. Jetty will increase the professional and commercial reputations of project partners through their association with innovative arts practice and a high profile academic research project. 
6. Jetty will provide collaborating companies and suppliers with an innovative showcase for marketing and promoting their products and services, and the opportunity to increase their own network of contacts within the sustainability arena.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2015-06-30</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-10-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>280761</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Scale reproduction of the burnt out section of the Staithes as an art installation, to be hosted in a significant publicly accessible space in Newcastle/Gateshead area.

Bridge tested the aesthetic and technical options of spanning the burnt out section of the Staithes, implementing structural developments and sparked debates around how the gap can be addressed through contemporary building and structural technologies. Future use of the structure was proposed and the feasibility of reconnecting the parts of the Staithes structure were explored.

Based on the ideas an concepts that have been developed through the artwork, the Tyne and Wear Building Preservation Trust is currently investigating solutions that would allow new uses of the Dunston Staiths. A key aspect is how the potential bridging of the gap would enable a new reading of the site and provide a platform for a interaction and engagement with industrial heritage of the region.</gtr:impact><gtr:title>Bridge</gtr:title><gtr:type>Artwork</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://jetty-project.info/bridge/</gtr:url><gtr:yearFirstProvided>2014</gtr:yearFirstProvided></gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>Cone is a new artwork situated on the Dunston Staiths, a landmark Scheduled Monument and Grade II structure on the south bank of the River Tyne in Newcastle Gateshead.

During the installation students gained first hand experience in project planning and site management, system scaffolding techniques, problem solving as well as the experience of working on a professional construction site. Students were also working for the first time with Aquadyne a new and innovative material used in construction. Students were encouraged to engage fully with the process and to engage with discussions and debates that were sparked by the making process.

The students were actively engaged in the project thus widening their understanding of contemporary art, public art practice and academic research. The students gained a variety of transferable skills as listed above which will impact on their professional understanding and add to their employability portfolio. In particular using the recycled material Aquadyne engaged the students in new ideas around sustainability and the innovative use of recycled materials impacting on their wider understanding of environmental issues.

The situation of the artwork on the Dunston Staithes also acted to generate interest in the structure and its heritage, with members of the apprentice team sharing memories of their families past on the structure, and local knowledge of its use and function with our researchers.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://jetty-project.info/art/the-making-of-cone/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Transfer-Laban Press</gtr:description><gtr:form>A press release, press conference or response to a media enquiry/interview</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>596978C1-76B3-4ADD-AD34-2FB586CB0606</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Press release and media promotion/marketing by Locus+ and Canary Wharf Group to attract media coverage for the Transfer-Laban Installation.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Media (as a channel to the public)</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://group.canarywharf.com/media/press-releases/wolfgang-weileder-transfers-the-facade-of-the-laban-building-in-deptford-to-canary-wharf-240516/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Cone Opening Event</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>66215790-79DD-415E-8657-9B208932E479</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Launch event for the opening of Cone, with invited members of the local councils, arts organisations, local interest groups and local community groups.

3 July - Preview/Launch: The Cone launch event attracted local and regional groups including residents/artists/urban professionals who attended the launch event and participated in guided tours of the artwork that raised the profile of the continuing work on the Dunston Staiths.

17 July - Sustainability Cafe: This engaged with local practitioners and members of the public in an on-site discussion of the role of sustainability, art and the urban environment. This led to increased discussions around the questions of sustainability and public art.

23 August - A Better Noise &amp;amp; Jetty-Project present: John Butcher; 6 September - A Better Noise &amp;amp; Jetty-Project present: Rhodri Morgan: These events had a significant impact for both the Jetty-Project and A Better Noise (a Newcastle based sound art collaboration), with A Better Noise having their first sold-out event. The two events had positive feedback from audience members, and led to the production of a series of audio recordings that will be released in the new year. The events also had the impact of creating an ongoing relationship between A Better Noise and Tyne and Wear Building Preservation Trust to carry out future events, as well as future collaborations with members of the research team. This also had the impact of providing access for the first time to many local residents, with people recounting their stories of previous encounters with the structure.

28 August - Bird watching at the Cone: this had the impact of providing access to the Staithes for the first time for many local residents, as well as raising awareness, through collaboration with Durham Wildlife Trust, of the special conditions for birds around the area, and the ongoing activities to ensure a sustainable habitat for wildlife.

August &amp;amp; September, Artist Tours of Cone: Again, these gave an opportunity for the public to access the structure for the first time, and also resulted in an increased awareness of the structures importance in local, national and international industrial heritage, with visitors engaging with the ideas of sustainability and art as presented through these tours. For one visitor at least, this was the first time she had engaged with the structure as a site of significant industrial heritage, and changed her perception of its value to the area and more widely.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://jetty-project.info/cone-summer-events/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs/><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>Our project can already demonstrate economical and societal impact. Through our research initiative the Tyne and Wear Building preservation Trust (TWBPT) was awarded approximately 500K from the HLF to restore the Dunson Staiths as a direct result of their relationship the Jetty Project. Over the next two years parts of the Dunston Staiths will be reconstructed and made accessible to the general public, with part of the Staithes recently made publicly accessible for the first time in decades. TWBPT are further planning to continue a cultural programme of events on the staiths that has been directly initiated by this research project. 

Working with TWBPT and other key partners from the industry and education sector have allowed for access to new audiences and stakeholders that we would not necessarily have been able to reach without these links. 

Identifying local colleges as a resource for mutual skills exchange and collaboration, has allowed us to provide opportunities for local students to engage with our research and ideas and concepts of sustainability. Furthermore participating students have directly benefited from the project by developing their educational learning outcomes/portfolios i.e. onsite experience and professional mentoring.

We are expecting further direct impacts from the project as we continue to disseminate our research and engage with the local community and cultural sector.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>6072D607-5616-46EC-B225-1CAD480149EC</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Cultural,Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Construction,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project's aim was to investigate how a fine-art led research project can catalyse debates around the meaning of sustainability in the urban realm. We placed a particular emphasis on suitability and heritage, alongside the three main pillars of sustainability, through three large-scale artworks, one public, one gallery based and one unrealised conceptual work on and around the Dunston Staithes. The multi-layered conception and realisation of these works acted as a productive generator of discourses related to the history, present and future of activity around this structure, and contributed to the reimagining of the potentials around disused infrastructures and their long-term futures. This has had direct results in the contribution to establishing funding for the long-term future of part of the structure, and in particular the dissemination of complex discussions and analysis through our project publication, Catalyst.

During the course of the funded research we have been able to identify and extend our relationships with collaborators and to form new research partnerships. In working with third party collaborators we have also identified important new research resources. 

The Jetty-Project has facilitated a new research partnership between the School of Arts and Cultures, Newcastle University and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Lancaster University. We are currently planning to continue and extend this new partnership with further joint research projects and grant applications. 

As well as attracting a significant amount of financial and in kind support from both the cultural sector and the building industry the project has enabled new partnerships which have significantly contributed to the research.

Due to the nature of this project and the large-scale art installations that we have conceived of and installed, we have been able to develop our skills and methodologies with regards to collaborating with other educational institutions such as local Further Education Colleges.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>In order to take our findings forward and be put to use by others the project needs to be fully disseminated. We anticipate this at and beyond the project completion date, through both publications and future exhibitions. Dissemination through the book Catalyst has begun, with copies sent to major regional, national and international art, heritage and sustainability organisations, and we envisage the findings and lessons taken from the project to be absorbed and implemented in the continuing academic, practice and public debates around this research area.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>A9F29FDD-4839-4C38-8EE9-B19EDC85ABDA</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.jetty-project.info</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D6BFC30F-FE7F-4042-9A2D-EF200CD1A87F"><gtr:id>D6BFC30F-FE7F-4042-9A2D-EF200CD1A87F</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creative uncertainty: art, heritage and environmental change in Gateshead (UK).</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab"><gtr:id>9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/D6FD8144-410B-4E1B-8FB8-EFA31EEF5937"><gtr:id>D6FD8144-410B-4E1B-8FB8-EFA31EEF5937</gtr:id><gtr:title>Jetty Project: Art and Sustainability</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/1691257627bed0ff3916f7e5608b98f6"><gtr:id>1691257627bed0ff3916f7e5608b98f6</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Weileder W</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6BDE9BFE-2217-4B96-A2D3-75BB640C968D"><gtr:id>6BDE9BFE-2217-4B96-A2D3-75BB640C968D</gtr:id><gtr:title>Catalyst: reimagining sustainability with and through fine art</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>Ecology and Society</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/90ece00c991f0cb34fbcc7249c3b03e8"><gtr:id>90ece00c991f0cb34fbcc7249c3b03e8</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Connelly A</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/1D787DD6-2574-4951-98E1-78070FEEE44B"><gtr:id>1D787DD6-2574-4951-98E1-78070FEEE44B</gtr:id><gtr:title>Catalyst Art, Sustainability and Place in the work of Wolfgang Weileder</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/d08004e5be15e78504c8a3fd4a914959"><gtr:id>d08004e5be15e78504c8a3fd4a914959</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Simon Guy</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date><gtr:isbn>978-3-7356-0095-0</gtr:isbn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9F932106-6B28-4E55-A96B-CE3D49324A54"><gtr:id>9F932106-6B28-4E55-A96B-CE3D49324A54</gtr:id><gtr:title>Art and Sustainability: Design in the MakingR</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab"><gtr:id>9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:issn>-</gtr:issn></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/6646993F-B9D9-4A9B-9471-F6E95675FFB6"><gtr:id>6646993F-B9D9-4A9B-9471-F6E95675FFB6</gtr:id><gtr:title>Creative Disruptions: Artistic Contributions to Urban Sustainability</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab"><gtr:id>9140226d6fb8681025e4527476c6dbab</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Guy, S.</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K006932/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>E844174D-6A1C-4D2D-8F24-57698F7DA353</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Environmental planning</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>972C8509-5001-4523-9E10-7FA67E2F2E69</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Visual arts</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>287497FB-DD4A-44CC-AC13-DBAFADC9AD82</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Applied Arts HTP</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>2D2B04A8-2CC9-41D9-B5EF-78E0AF1A8B24</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Installation &amp;
