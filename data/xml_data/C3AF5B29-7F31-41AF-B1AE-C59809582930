Hull and East Yorkshire Community Foundation (HEYCF). The Knowledge Transfer collaboration develops existing research knowledge of the academic team - based upon their ongoing work on ESV -, the contacts, expertise and experience of the broad range of organisations within the Employee Volunteering Network, and the evolving work of HEYCF. The primary objectives of the collaboration are as follows:&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
 

 &lt;li>to create an effective brokerage model for HEYCF to utilise in co-ordinating ESV activities within the Humber and East Yorkshire region&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to advise on the piloting, and evaluate the effectiveness, of the brokerage model being developed by HEYCF&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to work in partnership with HEYCF to identify the processes through which this model can become financially sustainable&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to examine ways in which the brokerage model can be disseminated to other groups and locations&lt;/li>

 &lt;li>to consider the implications of the development of brokerage activities within the context of the coalition government?s policy changes regarding third sector infrastructural funding and business-community engagement around the ?Big Society? agenda.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul></gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>1) Private and public sector organisations implementing or developing ESV strategies - While many companies are seeking to engage with CSR through ESV schemes, the limited amount of knowledge currently available regarding the type of engagement activities and the potential impact of these activities results in organisations often picking more easily identifiable opportunities rather than those that potentially can have the greatest impact, both for the local community/third sector organisation and for the organisation and its employees undertaking the ESV activity. As organisations are keen to evaluate and measure the impact of their ESV activities, the findings and toolkit developed from this project will provide a valuable resource for ensuring that resources are utilised effectively.
2) Third sector organisations seeking to engage business. With increasing restrictions on traditional public sector funding avenues, many third sector organisations are now seeking to engage with the business community for funding and support. However, many of these organisations find it difficult to market their organisations and the accompanying volunteering opportunities to the business sector. The brokerage model will help provide a bridge for engagement. Similarly, the resulting toolkit will provide third sector organisations with guidance and advice in identifying, marketing and costing the volunteering opportunities that they can offer. As currently many third sector organisations suggest that engaging with business around ESV can actually be costly to their organisation, both in terms of supervising and training volunteers, and utilising staff time that could be spent elsewhere, making engagement more effective will have a significant impact. 
3) Organisations undertaking, or seeking to develop, a brokerage role for ESV. As the number of companies engaging with ESV increases, so the demand for suitable volunteering opportunities expands. Organisations that have traditionally co-ordinated volunteering activities are finding it increasingly hard to keep up with the current demand; this has been exacerbated by increasing government emphasis upon developing volunteering activities for the long-term unemployed, young people, etc. In addition to these traditional groups, brokerage roles are being developed by consultancies and other organisations, seeing this as a significant potential source of revenue or as part of the reshaping of infrastructural support for third sector organisations. Again, this project will provide invaluable material for these groups.
4) Government Policy makers. The increase in volunteering activity and the greater involvement of both individuals and businesses within their local communities has been a cornerstone of the governments 'big society' agenda. The findings from this project will have direct relevance for policy-makers within this field, both at a national and local level. With major budgetary cuts and large scale infrastructural reductions, the successful development of brokerage frameworks such as this may provide a valuable tool in effectively directing support to local community groups.
5) Company Employees undertaking ESV activities. Because the brokerage framework focuses upon creating a more successful connection between the volunteering opportunities available, the company aims for ESV and employees motivations to engage with the schemes, the project will also have an impact on the employees actually undertaking the volunteering activities. 
While the project itself focuses upon activities being developed and undertaken within the Humber region, the application of the brokerage framework and toolkit is of far wider relevance. Through the ongoing activities of the Employee Volunteering Network and strong links with business and community organisations such as Business in the Community, there will be excellent opportunities to publicise and expand the impact of the project nationally.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-05-31</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE"><gtr:id>924BE15C-91F2-4AAD-941A-3F338324B6AE</gtr:id><gtr:name>ESRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-04-01</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>36658</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Business in the Community</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Skills Exchange Programme</gtr:description><gtr:id>BBD07CE8-6DA0-4630-AFF3-053B845FDE6B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Outputs are pending the new series of regional workshops on ESV brokerage.</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>First collaboration ESV Policy breakfast hosted by OCS in January 2016. national event designed to develop the debate on ESV infrastructure and set the frame for the regional workshops.

Three keys stages of non-academic impact have resulted;
1) The project team has joined the Skills Exchange network coordinated by the Office for Civil Society (OCS) and we are leading with OCS on developing infrastructural support and brokerage for Employee Sponsored Volunteering. The research findings have underpinned this strand of the Skills Exchange programme. 2) in partnership with OCS, Business in the Community and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations we are running 12 regional events to develop cross-sectoral dialogue on ESV. This is a scaling up of the original project which undertook these processes in one regional now extended to national policy strategy. 3) the research from the original project and these new workshops will be used by OCS to inform the 3-days a year volunteering leave policy development, via OCS and Business Innovation Skills departments.
Adding to this new work is underway with Chartered Institute Personnel Development (CIPD) on using the findings on HR and Skills to develop recommendations for CIPD members in developing ESV under skills and development strategies in firms.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>92BBBABA-728E-49D0-A756-B4BBDF22E9AB</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal,Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections,Pharmaceu</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>This has not changed since the last submission</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>same as previous submission</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>31A020CB-0DFF-4574-ABDD-CD2A42FFB881</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Aerospace, Defence and Marine,Agriculture, Food and Drink,Chemicals,Communities and Social Services/Policy,Construction,Creative Economy,Digital/Communication/Information Technologies (including Software),Education,Electronics,Energy,Environment,Financial Services, and Management Consultancy,Healthcare,Leisure Activities, including Sports, Recreation and Tourism,Government, Democracy and Justice,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology,Culture, Heritage, Museums and Collections</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www2.hull.ac.uk/hubs/research/research-impact/case-studies/full-employer-volunteering.aspx</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Evaluation of Two Heads Marketing and Design (an SME) Employee Volunteering Practices</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0689C359-F172-48D3-A3F2-B4D278788225</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This work is on going, Two Heads Received the Project Evaluation report and we will engage further in early 2015 around policy and practice impacts.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Hull and East yorkshire Community Foundations CSR and borkerage policy</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>Local/Municipal/Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>407A0C35-97A4-4819-8C1A-BEB2DEB4E75E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The projects impacts on Hull and East Yorkshire community foundations policy and practices were two-fold, first, their business/third sector brokerage manager received training in ESV from our team through our joint work, which shaped the way in which she approached local organisations to offer brokerage and her understanding of the needs of business. Second, the organisation realised through our joint work that brokerage specifically on ESV would be highly difficult to make economically sustainable (without government subsides) in the Hull and East Yorkshire area. Consequently they widened their brokerage models to include offering CSR policy development support to business, which was particularly well received by the public mutuals and heath care sectors in Hull.</gtr:impact><gtr:type>Influenced training of practitioners or researchers</gtr:type></gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:policyInfluenceOutput><gtr:areas/><gtr:description>Role on the Skills Exchange Alliance Steering Committee</gtr:description><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>B6B9EF49-D765-4776-A5E7-13A748AF150E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Working with the skills exchange alliance members to encourage increased engagement with the skills volunteering agenda across companies and third sector.
