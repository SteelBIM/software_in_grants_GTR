Histories</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>AH/L008378/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>In a British context, and with significant exceptions, WWI still focuses largely on the white British armed forces active on the Western Front. While it is possible to subject the events of 1914-18 to disinterested and objective historical inquiry, the commemorative landscapes and rituals created after 1918, and reaffirmed each year in the UK and on the Western Front, tend to prevent a broader understanding of WWI as a global conflict that has continuing relevance for all communities in an increasingly cosmopolitan British society. This includes those for whom the Western Front, and the conventional British narratives associated with it, have limited significance. Many Indians fought on the Western Front, but people from different parts of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire, including Ukraine, Russia, and Poland are likely to focus more strongly on the fallout from the collapse of the Russian Empire 1917-22, and the subsequent emergence of new nations in central and eastern Europe after 1918. People of the Balkan states may be more interested in the post-1912 wars which essentially led to Yugoslavia, the fall of the Habsburg monarchy and the emergence of a stronger Greece. Turkey's participation in WWI led to the destruction of the Ottoman Sultanate and the creation of the modern Republic of Turkey. The Irish have yet a further perspective on these years.

The centrality of WWI to British identity has been reaffirmed by the UK government's ambitious &amp;pound;60 million programme to mark the centenary in 2014-18. The explicit objective is to remind the next generation 'that the First World War is not ancient history but a shared history that unites our country'. What of the many communities which have settled in Britain during the 20th century? Are they (intentionally or unintentionally) excluded? Some families have lived in Britain for several generations but do not necessarily feel any sense of engagement with previous commemorative events.

The proposed Centre aims to idntify and facilitate imaginative democratic community action and engagement around the memories and narratives of the period 1914-18 within the diverse communities which make up contemporary British Society. Initially the Centre will take advantage of its location and work with three, large cosmopolitan cities in the English East Midlands region: Nottingham, Leicester and Derby. These three cities have distinctive but comparable industrial heritages, and through the 20th Century experienced sustained immigration from all parts of Europe, the Commonwealth and elsewhere. From this foundation, and utilizing community networks, we aim to expand our community partnerships to achieve a national reach.

The Centre will be led by a cross-disciplinary network of academics from across the Arts and Humanities, the Social Sciences and the Information Technologies. The University of Nottingham and its partners in the Centre have a strong track record of working with community groups and our key mechanisms of engagement will include a comprehensive programme of community-focused events (themed roadshows, research surgeries, talks and training) co-ordinated by an experienced Community Liaison officer. Access to research expertise will be facilitated by two funding schemes: (i) a Community Challenge Fund to support community groups to gain access to training, facilities and expertise to assist the development of community-led programmes and support the development of bids to the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) schemes; and (ii) a Research Development Fund, aimed at extending the potential of a community-led HLF project or funding follow-up activities to further develop a completed HLF project. Mechanisms of engagement through events, and the funding schemes, will encourage fresh approaches to collaborations through the involvement of community theatre practitioners, community film makers and the novel use of technology through the UoN's digital research centres (e.g. Horizon).</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our proposal is for a 'Centre for Hidden Histories of the First World War' that will highlight the impact and subsequent legacies of the war on diverse communities within Britain whilst critically re-assessing their processes of collective remembrance and commemoration. Our primary aim is to develop new and imaginative ways of remembering and commemorating the WWI period, which are genuinely inclusive and reflect the complex and varied nature of British society in the 21st century. Drawing on the opportunities presented by the centenary of WWI, we will initiate new forms of community action and engagement around the memories and narratives of this period. The programme will focus initially on Nottingham, Leicester and Derby, the three large, ethnically mixed, cosmopolitan industrial and manufacturing centres of the English East Midlands. From these cities we will seek to expand the programme activities in conjunction with local community groups, who will be invited to co-design and co-produce the research, into a wider national programme.

As a community-focused project, the proposed programme is inherently geared towards knowledge exchange and impact. The Centre aims to enable community groups, with or without prior experience of research, to have greater engagement with academics. The three year programme is designed to deliver a direct and immediate impact upon the individuals within community groups and should enable them to: 

- formulate research questions, develop methodologies and access sources more easily
- learn how to access research expertise and facilities more effectively 
- develop skills in historical research and be able to conduct research across a broad spectrum of topics
- learn innovative research techniques such as crowd sourcing (with input from Computer Sciences)
- gain skills in recording data appropriately, presenting findings and creating research resources
- hone experience in initiating, organising and delivering community projects

In addition to community groups the programme offers an opportunity to have a positive impact on non-university organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, museums, libraries and archives through the development of new links to communities (and potentially new audiences and users), new knowledge and understanding of the holdings and sites cared for by these organisations and an increased capacity in mobilising community groups and academics to participate in future collaborative research projects.

The programme will also impact upon how schools and teachers approach the teaching of history relating to the contested histories of different community groups, cultural memory and heritage.

This project aims to develop our understanding of the Finnish civil war (1918) from an English language perspective, enabling a wider range of people to learn about the war. There is relatively little information available in the English language, and the aim is to fill this gap. The key outcome will be a website about the Finnish civil war. 

The other main aim is to help the younger members of the community develop skills. These will include learning how to construct the website and adding appropriate material to it; researching archives, magazines, journals and books in order to extract and use appropriate information; working with museum staff to obtain archival information; and conducting and analysing interview material.&amp;quot;</gtr:impact><gtr:partnerContribution>Dr Hunt led the project, liaised with the community partners and oversaw the delivery of the outputs</gtr:partnerContribution><gtr:piContribution>Funding, project development, community liaison support, impact support, access to Centre's network.</gtr:piContribution><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-01-01</gtr:start></gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaborationOutput><gtr:collaboratingOrganisation>Ruskin College Oxford</gtr:collaboratingOrganisation><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:description>Hidden History of the Labour Corps in Britain</gtr:description><gtr:id>BF0A275F-E4CA-4C0A-BE18-917BDF133137</gtr:id><gtr:impact>&amp;quot;CHH has sponsored a collaboration between Dr Lee Humber (Ruskin College) and disability advocacy group, My Life, My Choice. 'The Hidden History of the Labour Corps in the First World War: Contributions to the War Effort Made by People with Learning Disabilities' will achieve a very broad range of general and specific outcomes. The more specific and easily measurable ones are listed below, while more general outcomes - such as the enhanced confidence and broadened social and academic horizons of participants - will be evidenced through the quality of the final public presentations and of the video diary and any other web-based materials the research group produces. Specific outcomes include: 
1 To commemorate the military, economic and political contributions of people with learning disabilities during WWI. To celebrate their wartime heritage. This will be achieved through:
I. Video diary published on social media
II. Exhibition/Dissemination events: in Oxford and at Liverpool Hope University
III. Published, co-produced popular and academic historical papers 
2 Empowering a group commonly excluded from an academic research process - people with learning disabilities - to explore a hidden history and disseminate and validate the materials they discover.

These included five local schools (Markeaton Primary, Rosehill Infants, St Mary's Primary, Griffe Field Primary and Arboretum Primary), a young mums group and an over 50s group from QUAD. The well dressings were themed around Derby Green Spaces and the home front using information derived from the academic lead and project volunteers and exhibited at location in the city centre: D&amp;eacute;da, Derby Central Library, Derby Local Studies Library, Derby Cathedral and Derby Tourist Information Centre, the QUAD and the Derby Arboretum.
The well-dressing trail was launched on Saturday 25 June 2016 in the Orangery at Derby Arboretum by Deputy Mayor John Whitby and blessed by Canon Missioner Elizabeth Thomson from Derby Cathedral who described the Well Dressing trail as 'the green heart in Derby's historic spaces'. The well dressings were displayed until Sunday 3 July. 
The well dressing art is unique to Derbyshire. Traditionally well dressing frames are soaked in the local river before being packed with clay. A design is marked out onto the clay and then each section is carefully covered with individual flower petals, leaves, seeds, coffee beans, feathers and stones to complete the design.
Jenny Anthony, Creative Arts Director at Spiral Arts commented that:
'We have thoroughly enjoyed working on this project with the University of Derby, we have found it very interesting to research about the parks history 100 years ago. We hope to continue delving into the archives to find out more about how life was in the past and to use our findings to create a textile banner and historic WW1 exhibition at the Summer Celebration in August in the Arboretum Park..'
Clare Limb, Head of Dance Development &amp;amp; Learning said: 'It is a real honour to be involved in the well dressing trail again this year. We love the designs and we always hope that Spiral Arts will ask us again to host a well dressing at D&amp;eacute;da, it is a real privilege'</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>East Midlands Oral History Workshop</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7406F5A4-B9B5-4E6E-9012-D94D52032D7B</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Community Liaison Officer and one of the Co-Is, Dr Natalie Braber, spoke at a community workshop event organised by the East Midlands Oral History Archive in partnership with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Professor Paul Elliott was interviewed on the Andy Potter show on BBC Radio Derby. The interview lasted about 35 minutes and focussed upon the use of public parks and green spaces during the First World War in Derby. It was timed to coincide with public lecture that Prof Elliott gave on the same subject the next day at the Quad in Derby, and helped to promote this.

During the interview, Prof Elliott outlined the ethos of the Centre for Hidden Histories before going on to answer questions about the impact of the War upon Derby culture and society and the role of parks. He emphasised how wide the audience was that we were hoping to reach and also provided examples of some of the projects already under way. Andy Potter asked about some of Professor Elliott's findings and took a very keen interest in the project, including work that he had done on the role of Rolls Royce during the War and also the ways in which the War was commemorated in Derby, including the presentation of guns and other memorabilia.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>First World War Black History Month event (Leeds)</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>National</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15D19AA5-B605-447C-BA6D-21887B652E3C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre co-financed and provided on-the-day support for a two day event at Leeds City Museum to coincide with Black History Month</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>http://hiddenhistorieswwi.ac.uk/uncategorized/2016/10/study-and-community-events-leeds-october-2016/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Derby WW1 Green Spaces Community History Project: Exhibition and Textile Banner Launch</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>7DA90832-6F37-428A-9798-EC0BC053F244</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Launch of the exhibition with information boards and textile banner produced by Spiral Arts and project volunteers at the Orangery in the Derby Arboretum on 21 August 2016 as part of the 'Lark in the Park' event also supported by the Health Lottery and Healthcalm backed by the People's Health Trust.

Refreshments were provided and a harpist played to create an appropriate atmosphere. The public were able to examine and interact with the displays (the textile banner had flaps with more information and pictures beneath). The project provided a valuable and enjoyable experience for our students of working with heritage, arts and community groups, experienced academics and the general public to bring history to new audiences.

The research bursaries of &amp;pound;2,163 each were advertised and awarded on a competitive basis to two undergraduate history students, Stuart Bagley and Andrew Fairbrother. The students negotiated their own specialised projects as a contribution to the main venture and also helped to design, research and produce the textile banner and information boards. They chose to focus on WW1 memorial parks of south Derbyshire and allotments and food production on the home front. Their research findings and information banners were presented at the Derby University Learning and Teaching Conference at Buxton (4 July 2016) and subsequently formed part of the exhibition in the Orangery at the Derby Arboretum. This was launched on 21 August 2016 as part of the 'Lark in the Park' event, which included a speech from local councillor Jangir Khan praising their work. Stuart, one of the students, also gave a speech explaining the rationale for his information board and answered questions from the public audience.

The Centre received several applications to the funding scheme as a direct result of these events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reflection Workshop: Kidology Arts</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>8D1B968D-E020-43EC-AB72-2313D9D9559C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre Co-ordinator held a reflective discussion with an HLF funded group and developed plans for collaboration</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Reflection Workshop with Ramgarhia Sikh Board, Leicester</gtr:description><gtr:form>A formal working group, expert panel or dialogue</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>0050FB99-0E68-4C1A-AB0A-144D1098B1D7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The Centre Co-ordinator held a reflective discussion with an HLF funded group and developed plans for collaboration</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2014</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Interactive workshop as part of university lifelong learning outreach provision, linking historical and present-day concerns and presenting primary sources from the library's special collections.</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Local</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>CA2D8A2F-96EE-470C-AD6E-77FB7C606936</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This interactive workshop, entitled 'Thinking about Europe: The Fate of German and British 'Enemy Aliens' during the First World War', was held on the eve of the 2016 EU Referendum (22 June 2017).
