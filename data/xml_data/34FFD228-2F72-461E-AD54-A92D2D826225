(iGIVE)</gtr:title><gtr:status>Active</gtr:status><gtr:grantCategory>Research Grant</gtr:grantCategory><gtr:grantReference>EP/L001063/1</gtr:grantReference><gtr:abstractText>The UK government is determined to address the challenges of tackling climate change and maintaining energy security in a way that minimises costs and maximises benefits to the economy. Among all sources of CO2 emissions in the UK, the energy supply accounts for about 40%, followed by the transport for over 25%. To meet the target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050, large proportion of electricity generated from low carbon sources integrated with mass adoption of electric vehicles (EV) offer a great potential. Likewise, the Chinese 12th National Economic and Social Development Five-Year Plan has set the target of 3.5% reduction per unit of GDP in both energy use and carbon dioxide emissions, and identified new energy and clean energy vehicles among the seven priority industries in the next five years from 2012. 

It is clear that both countries are fully committed to a planned 'decarbonisation' of their respective energy systems. However, both face the challenges of planning and building the suitable infrastructure, and of managing the resources to ensure future power systems operate more reliably, more flexibly, and more economically, by integrating and coordinating the actions of all actors. It has been widely recognized that electric vehicles could both benefit from and help to drive forward the development of smart grids where renewable resources are widely and substantially employed. However, a number of technical challenges are still open for further exploitation. 

The proposed collaborative interdisciplinary research will investigate and develop an intelligent grid interfaced vehicle eco-charging (iGIVE) system for more reliable, more flexible and efficient, and more environmental friendly smart gird solutions for seamless integration of distributed low-carbon intermittent power generation and large number of EVs. To achieve this, a multilayer hierarchical power and information flow framework for monitoring and optimal control of the EV charging while minimising the volume of information passed to the utility control centers will be investigated first. Within this framework, a variable rate bi-directional high performance EV battery charging unit based on a patented technology will be developed, and battery management and optimal EV charging and discharging dispatching strategies will be investigated. Other issues associated to the charging stations, such as electromagnetic interference and harmonics generation and their impact on environment and electricity grid will also be studied. Finally, simulation platform will be built to investigate the interactions of EV-related different participants and their impact on the grid operations. A test bed to verify the design will be developed and a joint UK-China joint laboratory on smart grid and EV integration will be established, bringing together key academic and industry partners in smart grid and EV from UK and China.

Both system operators and EV industry in the UK, China and other parts of the world will benefit considerably from the development of intelligent EV eco-charging systems when a large number of EVs are adopted by the public and greater amounts of renewable power are utilized, as they provide an adaptive and intelligent framework and EV charging systems to economically, efficiently and environment-friendly accommodate charging requirements as well as providing ancillary service to the grid integrated with larger amounts of intermittent renewable energy sources and thereby enable the decarbonisation of the electricity supply industry and the transport sector.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>Our vision is to advance the understanding and realization of the integration of electric vehicles with the grid and renewable energy sources through a novel fundamental and yet holistic approach involving new scientific, multi-disciplinary, international (UK-China and others) collaborations that will tackle technical, societal and economic challenges facing stakeholders in the EV, the smartgrid and renewable energy supply chains.The project programme will strengthen existing links between the research organisations between UK and China, and forge new links with key Chinese institutions and industry in the fields of EVs, utility and renewable energy. Thus, the programme's impacts will be both far-reaching and long-lasting, and will ultimately benefit everyone in the UK and China, and beyond.

Doc Brown famously modified the DeLorean as a time machine in the Back to the Future movies, the second of which saw Marty McFly travel to 21 October 2015 to prevent his future son being sent to prison.

On that exact date, Queen's and NIE Networks unveiled the latest version of the famous car, which students and staff have modified as a hi-tech electrical vehicle - the first of its kind in the UK or Ireland. It is thought to be the first DeLorean to be built in Northern Ireland since production came to a halt at DeLorean's Belfast factory in 1983.

Students and staff from Queen's School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, have painstakingly restored and modified the DeLorean DMC-12 over the last eighteen months. It was revealed on Wednesday at the Ulster Museum. Local school children got a preview of the car on Wednesday morning, with the opportunity to find out more about the Electrical Engineering courses on offer at Queen's, while members of the public can find out more about the Queen's Electric DeLorean project at a free public lecture at the Ulster Museum at 6pm.

Aggregator unit is built between grid and electric vehicle. Here means station-level control system. The top-layer grid energy management system only controls station-level control system, so its control is more flexible. When electric vehicles in some region have problems, corresponding station-level control system can be cut off from grid to keep the whole grid safe.
Basic load is not suited to V2G, because it's cheap, it needs continuous running and it makes EV discharge long time. Peak-load regulation, secondary frequency regulation and reserve service are suited to V2G, and these bring more benefit.

First type service: slow charging+ secondary frequency regulation. It mainly applies to the area or parking lot where the total number of EV is low. Though there isn't enough capacitor to discharge long time, it can weaken grid load fluctuation caused by charging and discharging in a short time. Arriving time, leaving time, initial SOC of EV and leaving SOC of EV are required beforehand. The net earning of V2G users mainly includes: frquency modulation profit, energy profit and battery loss cost. And the corresponding power or energy multiplied by electrovalence is profit. Because frquency modulation power is uncertain in frquency modulation service, so battery loss cost is calcultaed based on typical working conditions, and charging and discharging are accounted for separately.

Second type service: slow charging+secondary frequency regulation+peak-load regulation. The EV market is mature and EVs have enough idle energy to complete various kinds of services. Second type service is different from first type service, and it needs three services work at the same time. The constraint conditions between first type and second type service are nearly the same. First type service does not need peak-load regulation, so it does not allow EV to discharge to the grid proactively. While EV users are allowed to discharge to the grid proactively using the second type service. In addition, each EV is mutually independent and the solution of their optimal contract does not influence each other using first type service. All EVs are no longer independent because of peak-load regulation using second type service. A distribution method is obtained based on discharge priority which is &amp;quot;first come first served&amp;quot;. All users can get most profit.</gtr:description><gtr:id>0390DFD4-A2F1-43DD-8B72-6EF218BEFC92</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The control strategy can potentially been embedded in V2G system</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>EV user optimum V2G control strategy in parking lot</gtr:title><gtr:type>Data handling &amp; control</gtr:type></gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutput><gtr:description>Firstly, a battery model that can predict the battery behaviour under different load profiles and temperature conditions is normally the starting point and foundation for the BMS design. Secondly, since the battery is a sealed compact object, its internal states are not directly measurable, such as the battery SOC, and internal temperature, which are the two dominant battery internal states affecting the battery performance and need to be estimated in real-time. Therefore, model-based battery internal state estimation methods are also proposed in this thesis using the Kalman filter method. Finally, based on the proposed battery model and internal state estimation methods, the battery temperature management system is studied, and different temperature controllers are optimized, and their performance compared, which can offer valuable guidance to the BTMS system design and real-time controller design</gtr:description><gtr:id>7F554321-587E-47E4-8481-0A316CCF501E</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The internal temperature is a better indicator of batter status than surface temperature.

So spatiotemporal distributions of electric vehicle are predicted based on traffic attaction volume in the transportation planning and land utilization data combined with the properties of EV driving and parking
This model is obtained based on the land-use situations in commercial, industrial and residential areas and the properties of EV parking. First of all, the researched area is divided into several sub-regions, and each sub-region is the smallest unit of space. Spatiotemporal distributions situations of parking demands are obtained based on traffic attaction volume combined with the model of traffic volume and parking demand. Spatiotemporal distributions model of parking demands is obtained based on the land-use situations in commercial, industrial and residential areas and the properties of EV parking. Finally model are calculated based on the properties of EV driving. The properties of EV driving in each area and V2G charging/discharging progress are simulated using Monte Carlo method.

In our study, a novel method is first proposed to represent the coupling relationships between nodes by using two analytical expressions derived from Kirchhoff's equations. Then, a recursive bipartitioning strategy is proposed to divide a power grid into different regions. In each network partitioning step, the coupling relationship between generator nodes is applied to dividing the generator nodes under study to two groups, and the voltage sensitivities of generators to loads are used to merge the relevant load nodes to the corresponding groups of generators. 
The proposed approach involves two main steps: the nodes coupling relationship matrix computation and the recursive network partitioning calculation. Each of the network partitioning processes is further divided into two sub-steps, i.e., the bipartitioning of generator nodes and the merging of load nodes. The purpose of the partitioning process of generator nodes is to divide the generators nodes into two groups where the generator nodes within a group have strong coupling relationships, while the generator nodes between different group is sufficiently uncoupled. The purpose of the loads merging process is to group the load nodes under study into the region where it has the strong coupling relationship with at least one generator node.
Case studies have been conducted on the IEEE 118-bus system and a practical provincial-level power system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Simulation results have shown that reasonable network partitioning results can be obtained after a small number of recursive partitioning processes</gtr:description><gtr:id>8ACEC57D-39B8-436E-B951-20A014BEFC7C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Potentially used for VAR Management.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A Novel Power Grid Partitioning Method for VAR Management and Voltage Control</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>A novel 2kW PMSM machine is specifically designed for the iGIVE program to provide traction and battery charging. It is a dual-use machine technology that eliminates the requirement to have an additional on-board battery charger. Comprehensive design and simulation have been conducted including:
? Systematic design has been carried out to satisfy the requirement of the dual-use traction charging system. The challenges for the PMSM drive are torque ripple elimination and three-phase inductance asymmetry during charging. Both of these challenges have been resolved by special pole slot combination and a patentable winding design. FEM simulation has been conducted for validation.

The use of a power meter is a simple and easy way to monitor energy, but the cost can sometimes be high. On the other hand, viscosity is regarded as one of the key indicators of melt quality in the polymer extrusion process. Unfortunately, viscosity cannot be measured directly using current sensory technology. The employment of on-line, in-line or off-line rheometers is sometimes useful, but these instruments either involve signal delay or cause flow restrictions to the extrusion process, which is obviously not suitable for real-time monitoring and control in practice. In this paper, simple and accurate real-time energy monitoring methods are developed. This is achieved by looking inside the controller, and using control variables to calculate the power consumption. For viscosity monitoring, a 'soft-sensor' approach based on an RBF neural network model is developed. The model is obtained through a two-stage selection and differential evolution, enabling compact and accurate solutions for viscosity monitoring. The proposed monitoring methods were tested and validated on a Killion KTS-100 extruder, and the experimental results show high accuracy compared with traditional monitoring approaches</gtr:description><gtr:id>547E8AAA-324B-475D-8386-AD485737C5CA</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The method has led to the development of Point Energy technology which has won several awards and currently been implemented in several industrial companies for energy saving.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Low-cost process monitoring for polymer extrusion</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type><gtr:url>http://www.pointenergy.org/</gtr:url></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>One of the key operational activities in the power system is to schedule power production according to the predicted load demands. Dynamic economic and environmental dispatches (DEED) are both crucial objectives in this scheduling task because a small percentage improvement may potentially bring significant cost savings and operational improvements. The goal of economic dispatch is to minimize the cost by determining the power production of thermal power plant units, while managing system constraints, balancing power production and load demand, and meeting plant operational requirements, e.g. ramp rates. Similarly, the objective of environmental dispatch is to minimize emissions under the same system constraints. Both dispatch problems are difficult to solve due to the non-smooth non-convex DEED formulations in cost functions and constraints, especially for large power systems. 
Fast development of renewable power sources and changes in load demand bring more planning and operational uncertainties to the grid. Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) with high penetrations are potentially important participants in the power system due to the additional large load requirements. The stochastic charging of PEVs may also significantly affect the distribution grid as well as increase the generation costs and pollutants emissions if not managed efficiently. It is therefore of importance to measure the impact of different PEV charging scenarios on the power system and intelligently schedule and dispatch power generation using an optimized DEED system approach. 
A variety of objective and constraint handling methods have been developed to tackle different scheduling scenarios such as static and dynamic dispatch reserve constrained dispatch as well as ELD integrating with renewable energy sources. These non-smooth and non-convex tasks have imposed significant challenges on the conventional optimization techniques. Hence, heuristic approaches are widely used in solving the ELD problem. In this work, four different types of PEV loads including an institute published load profile, peak and off-peak load profiles and a stochastic load profile are integrated into the dynamic economic load dispatch problem and environmental load dispatch problem respectively. A recently proposed meta-heuristic method, namely the teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) is utilized to solve the EELD problem. The four cases of PEV load deployment strategies that shape the charging loads in different time periods are assessed and compared in terms of the total cost and pollutant emissions.
A small scale 5-unit system and a large scale 15-unit system are tested in 24-hour time period. Four different PEV charging scenarios including EPRI predicted charging, off-peak charging, peak charging and stochastic charging profiles with different number of PEV have been integrated in the load demands of both systems. The numerical results show that the new SL-TLBO algorithm is a viable alternative approach for solving both small and large scale dynamic dispatch problems and outperforms other popular heuristic methods and state-of-the-art TLBO variants in the tests on well-known benchmarks and DEED problem with proper parameter tuning. In terms of the four PEV charging scenarios, the off-peak charging scenario, as expected, has the advantage in reducing the economic cost and environmental pollutant emissions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>4B9E8381-F172-4498-8B23-348A012A9319</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This output could assist to develop smart charging control strategy.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Non-convex Dynamic Economic/Environmental Dispatch with Plug-in Electric Vehicle Loads</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>When a decision-making problem is a process influenced by multiple independent features, each question can be directed against each feature. Under this design, the number of question is minimum. However, if the features are not independent and no further decomposition of features is possible, then the internal logical relations among questions should be understood and considered in the process of knowledge extraction. 
Due to the shortage in range and energy supplement, the features influencing users' travel behaviors have great differences between an EV's and an oil-powered vehicle's. These feature aspects includes vehicle performance, user anxiety and particular scenario. Range is thought as a key feature in vehicle performance; range anxiety, time for quick charging and queuing up during a travel, etc. are chosen to reflect user anxiety; charge times during a travel is chosen to describe the influences from particular scenario.
The features of range, range anxiety and charge times during a travel are interrelated. Under a given travel scenario, users' choices on range and range anxiety should be known before charge times is confirmed. Therefore, range and range anxiety are put into the place where their extractions are sooner than the particular scenario features. The questions about particular scenario features contain an option called &amp;quot;depending on other conditions&amp;quot;, which is designed to be connected with user anxiety features, in order to avoid the increase of similar questions in each particular scenario and respondents' boredom. Enlarged coverage area of questions on scenarios is obtained by tactfully using relative values instead of absolute values (e.g. using charge times during a travel instead of using travel distance directly), and the relation among questions (e.g. range and charge times). Meanwhile, the dependency of effective questionnaire analysis on the number of samples is decreased by including a question to sort the importance of user anxiety features.</gtr:description><gtr:id>CEEE1C22-F5FA-4A9B-AB4E-4DFE140DD3CE</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The outcome could help both EV manufacturing and charging facility company to determine the optimal charging strategy and battery management system.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Questionnaire based method for studying EV users' traveling willingness</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>As an important step in power system operation, the unit commitment (UC) is a large scale non-convex mix-integer optimization problem. The on/off status of each unit and the determined to minimize the generation cost. Though a number of methods have been proposed to optimize the UC problem, it remains intractable to balance due the computational time and the result refinement. The UC problem becomes even more challenging when a large number of EVs are integrated into the system. In addition to traditional thermal units and predicted loads, the aggregation of a large number of PEVs would act as
both a large load when being charged and a distributed generator unit when being discharged. Some studies consequently introduced PEVs into the UC optimization procedure to evaluate the economic and environmental impacts of PEV charging and discharging within the conventional UC problem. Different PEV charging and discharging scenarios have shown significant impact on the cost, yet very
few publications have comparatively evaluated the difference of PEVs charging and discharging strategies within the UC problem. In this paper, multiple PEVs scenarios including four different charging-only scenarios, two different discharging only scenarios, two charging and discharging combination scenarios, as well as PEV s charging and discharging combined with renewable energy sources are comparatively studied in the UC problem, which is now called as the PEVUC problem. In this analysis the binary on/off problem in UC is solved using a quantum inspired binary PSO.

Quantum inspired and hybrid typology binary particle swarm optimization and other binary optimization methods are employed to determine the binary status of each unit. Four scenarios of wind generation over multiple seasons, one scenario of photovoltaic generation and four scenarios of plug-in electric vehicles charging loads are comparatively studied. The numerical results show that the new algorithm significantly overcomes the drawback of the original binary particle swarm optimization and is competitive in terms of solving the unit commitment problem. By utilizing these new tools, the contribution of economic cost and cost/saving rates are analyzed in multiple scenarios of unit commitment with the integration of renewable energy generation and plug-in electric vehicles charging.

A 10-unit UC problem is assessed, combining multiple PEV charging and discharging scenarios including charging only mode, discharging-only mode, charging and discharging mode, and charging and discharging combined with renewable energy generation mode. Different PEV scenarios are comparatively studied and the UC problem is solved using a quantum-inspired binary particle swarm optimization method. The results show that to charge PEVs during off-peak time and discharge PEV during peak time can bring significant benefits in terms of the economic cost. On the other hand, PEVs are promising to work together with the renewable generation to replace thermal units and gain profit.</gtr:description><gtr:id>5DF0D2A1-2677-4317-964C-92B58BF540BD</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This research proposed a good solution for unit commitment problem.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Unit commitment considering electric multiple charging and discharging scenarios of plug-in Electric Vehicles</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>In order to obtain the influence of frequency regulation on EVs batteries lifespan and the corresponding economic benefit. Depending on the life test of lithium-iron phosphate batteries, the model of EVs batteries is built. What's more, on account of the charging/discharging mode, the strategy of primary frequency regulation is generated. In the light of ambient temperature, the strategy of compensation for EVs users in different areas is analyzed.
Most topics study the deep dielectric charging and discharging of EVs batteries and built experimental model. However, in the process of power grid primary frequency regulation, the superficial dielectric charging/discharging is the key factor. In this topic, the model is based on the actual experimental data, considering four factors, cycle-index, temperature, depth of discharge and current. The lifespan of EVs batteries is measured by the capacity loss. In actual power system, change of frequency is very small. The character of battery lifetime can be linearized locally at the rated frequency. In order to avoid slight fluctuation, dead zone is set. In addition, the limit of power can avoid the battery in unhealthy situations, such as over-charging, over-discharging, etc.
For reflecting complexity of actual power system, single-region power grid model includes three generators with different generator frequency coefficients, zero bands and power distributions, all control primary frequency. What's more, two generators take part in secondary frequency control. Based on the data from Huabei power grid, comparing with power grid without EVs, the frequency deviation decreases by nearly one fifth.
There are two operating modes of EVs batteries, charging mode and discharging mode. Therefore, two strategies of primary frequency regulation are generated. In Stragety 1, EVs batteries can be seen as bi-directed transfer. Nevertheless, in Strategy 2, charging and discharging are separated into two groups
China is a far-flung zone country with different climate zones. Hence, the standard of compensation should depend on climate zones with different ambient temperature.

The EV-involved system should include automobile manufactories, public utilities including transportation systems, gas stations as well as the behind networks to supply oils, battery charging stations as well as the behind electric power systems and the environment system. Key participants are travelers, automakers, charging service providers, power grid companies and policy makers, etc. Travelers can be further classified into 2 types: the strongly controllable ones including taxi drivers, public transportation suppliers, etc. who earn money directly from transportation service, the weakly controllable ones mainly referring to drivers who use cars for private purposes. The former ones has better responses to policies than the latter ones. 
The use of oil-powered vehicles need support from gas station networks, and produce emissions to the environment. EVs need support from charging station networks whose power is fed by the power system. Because the use of EVs is expensive and contains low efficiency, e.g. the charging process is much longer than the refueling process, policy makers have to provide subsidies to EV manufacturers or customers. If not doing so, customers will not buy EVs and manufacturers have no passions to continue upgrading and expand production for EVs, which delays the EVs to become better and cheaper. As another consequence, charging stations remain poor popularity, the power system is still not friendly to EVs, and the environment continues enduring the emission from vehicles. Therefore, the dead cycle of the whole system is only reinforced. It is costly to break the dead cycle in the current technical conditions. Modeling the system and understanding the behaviors of key participants will help minimize the pain in the energy transition process.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3514B041-699C-438D-B44B-E71858F30A2C</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A very useful framework to study the impact of EV on our society.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>A research framework to present the interactivity among EVs, surrounding systems and key participants</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>For EVs, battery SOH is always defined with two specific forms, and they are SOHE and SOHP to indicate the degradation of energy and power, respectively.

The proposed hierarchical framework is presented as day-ahead scheduling and two-layer intra-hour adjustment systems. Two objectives, namely the operating cost minimization and tie-line power smoothing, are integrated into the framework. In the intra-hour adjustment, a master-client structure is designed. The CHP and thermostatically controlled loads are coordinated by a method with two different time scales in order to execute the schedule and handle uncertainties from the load demand and the renewable generation. To obtain the optimal set-points for the CHP, an integrated optimal power flow method is developed, which also incorporates three-phase electric power flow and natural gas flow constraints. Furthermore, based on a time priority list method, a three-phase demand response approach is proposed to dispatch thermostatically controlled loads at different phases and locations.
The developed methodology is applied to a simulated community energy system obtained from a modified IEEE 37-node system. Numerical results have shown that the proposed scheduling method can effectively reduce the operating cost while smooth the tie-power power fluctuations. It is also shown that the amount of data traffic will be significantly reduced as only the operating boundary information is transmitted. The proposed method can also be used to meet other requirements for the integrated community energy system, such as minimizing the energy loss and emissions.</gtr:description><gtr:id>31ECD926-87CC-4D98-A137-E76DD1598AC3</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The developed management system could help to reduce energy loss and emissions for integrated community energy system.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Hierarchical Management for Integrated Community Energy System</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Air-conditioning loads have greatly increased in recent years and the study shows that there will be still a huge demand for air conditioning loads. Voltage collapse accidents, for example the Paris blackout in 1978 and the Tokyo blackout in 1987, have occurred many times due to the rapid increase of ACLs in the short time.
In our study, a hierarchical two-level voltage friendly control strategy (VFCS) is proposed for air-conditioning loads (ACLs) to improve the voltage stability of power systems, by making use of the interruptible characteristics of the ACLs. On the top level, the control center determines the aggregated power and the voltage control thresholds of each node. At the bottom level, the aggregators of ACLs implement the control instructions from the control center by the output tracking control (OTC) for aggregated thermostatic loads. 
 The ACLs are modeled as a thermostatically-controlled model for OTC by using a novel partial differential equation. A two-stage control strategy is designed, in terms of their priorities. When the system is at a rather low voltage situation, the emergency control is first performed by the shutdown operations for ACLs, and then the universal set-point temperature control strategy is applied for output tracking control, according to the voltage control thresholds. Case studies have been conducted on a 28-node power grid. The results show that the proposed model and strategy can effectively improve the system voltage stability</gtr:description><gtr:id>0089D808-5787-40CE-8275-F97EC0D24DF7</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Potentially used when considering air-conditioning loads in control of power system</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Voltage Friendly Control Strategy of Air-Conditioning Loads</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Converter of electric vehicle charging and swapping station is the key equipment of energy bidirectional transmission between the battery and the AC power grid, the access of electric vehicle has a great impact on the current and power of the power grid side. To improve the power quality and ensure the network side has good properties in the process of battery charging and discharging, current on the AC side of the charging device converter must be reasonably controlled. Meanwhile, the DC voltage output stability of the charger should be ensured to avoid impact on battery life, owing to the great change of charging voltage.
For the charging and swapping power plant using H-bridge cascaded multilevel converter structured charger, DC voltage balance control method in and among phases are put forward. By controlling the DC voltage balance of the converter to ensure a stable output voltage of the charger, on one hand, achieves the overall balance of the a?b?c three-phase DC output voltage, that is, achieves the inter-phase DC voltage balance, so that in the charging and discharging process of electric vehicles, the system is in a three-phase equilibrium state. On the other hand, the voltage balance between the H-bridge within the single-phase equilibrium of the converter is realized, providing stable charging and discharging voltage for the battery. 
Combined with fixed switching frequency and hysteresis control characteristics, on the basis of hysteresis PWM current control method, the control of switching frequency is introduced to limit the switching frequency variation and the quasi-frequency hysteresis PWM current control is proposed. This will not only overcome the defects of sensitive circuit parameter change by fixed switching frequency PWM current control, but improve the tracking performance for the charging and swapping power station current on the power gri+*-d side. This will also solve the problem of varying switching frequencies in the hysteresis control and reduce the damage to the charger.
Through the simulation of battery charging and discharging process, the DC voltage can be stabilized at a given value and the current on the AC side realizes sinusoidal and in phase with the grid voltage, with small harmonic content and high power factor. The effectiveness of the charger control strategy provides the basis for large-scale electric vehicle charging.</gtr:description><gtr:id>3B96759D-E724-4A86-B561-F777FFB5B5AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This is a key technology in developing V2G infrastructure.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>H Bridge Cascade Converter Control in Charging and Swapping Station</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is proposed based on the developed battery electrical model at constant ambient temperature. Two different types of SOC estimation methods for Lithium-ion batteries are proposed and compared, one based on model parameter identification using WRLS method and another based on state estimation using EKF method. Considering that the battery internal resistance increases noticeably at low SOC level, the joint-EKF method is adopted for simultaneous estimation of both the system states and the time-varying model parameters.
A battery internal temperature estimation method is proposed based on the developed battery thermal model using EKF method, which can serve as a key indicator for battery real-time management and control. 
Finally, based on the developed battery thermoelectric model, a novel method is proposed for simultaneous estimation of both the battery internal temperature and SOC using EKF method. Different methods for calculating the heat generation inside the battery are compared, and the effect of battery internal temperature and SOC on the battery electrical behaviors is characterized experimentally and captured by the developed model. The time-varying thermal submodel parameter at different heat dissipation levels is also taken into consideration, and a joint EKF is applied to estimate the model states and time-varying model parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is based only on the online measurable signals, e.g., battery voltage, current and shell temperature, and thus can be implemented in real-time.

Of the distributed sources, renewable energy sources such as the wind and solar energy are uncontrollable, whilst distributed generators such as diesel generators, micro turbine and fuel cells which are controllable. Microgrid also includes fixed storage devices such as stationary battery banks or mobile storage devices such as electric vehicle (EV) batteries. In addition, it has controllable loads that can be curtailed to prevent the system from outages. Microgrid can operate either autonomously in an isolated mode, or linked to the utility grid in connected mode. In both operational modes, microgrid has to maintain stability and meet local loading demands. The increasing penetration of these new energy sources with distinctive operational features creates many challenges in various aspects, and in particular the optimal management of power flow within the microgrid. 

Scheduling strategies based on the optimised power flow in the microgrid are developed. The integration of EVs under different operational and environmental conditions are investigated, and different charging and discharging approaches have been carried out. 
The proposed approaches are tested on typical low voltage connected and isolated modes microgrids. It is shown that the EVs represent an interesting dynamics between the energy sources and loads.

The obtained charging load, with temporal features, is consecutive in the working days and the working-ends. Combined this charging load curve and intermittent generation output curves, the complementarities can be analyzed by several related quantitative indicators. In this regard our group is currently taking the private electric vehicle cluster and the electric bus cluster as examples to do the deep research and get some initial results.
(1) Procedural simulation method for aggregated charging load model of private electric vehicle cluster
The usage of each private electric vehicle (PEV) is a repeating behavior process composed by driving, parking, discharging and charging, which makes PEV show obvious procedural characteristics. This study analyzes the procedural characteristics, and proposes a procedural simulation method. The proposed method aggregates the behavior process regularity of the PEV cluster to model the cluster's charging load. Firstly, the basic behavior process of each PEV is constructed by referring the statistical datasets of the traditional private non-electric vehicles. Secondly, all the basic processes are set as a simulation starting point, and they are dynamically reconstructed by several constraints. The simulation continues until the steady state of charge (SOC) distribution and behavior regularity of the PEV cluster are obtained. Lastly, based on the obtained SOC and behavior regularity, the PEV cluster's behavior processes are simulated again to make the aggregating charging load model available. Examples for several scenarios show that the proposed method can improve the reliability of modeling by grasping the PEV cluster's procedural characteristics.
The modeling approach consists of two consecutive parts. The first part aims at aggregating information about the SOC and serialized time indicators for all the PEV individuals. And the second part models the charging load of the cluster based on the converged solution of the first part.
(2) Procedural modeling for charging load of electric buses cluster cased on battery swapping mode
To forecast and assess the impact of large-scale electric buses (EBs) to power grid, the aggregating charging load model of EBs cluster is indispensable. As EB's typical operating, including driving and parking, is a cyclical process and has obvious regularity, a procedural simulation method for aggregating charging load model of EBs cluster based on battery swapping mode is proposed. With the data come from specific buses lines and other information readily available, the process of each individual in EBs cluster is continuously simulated. Then time and SOC information of battery packs emerge and be recorded. Combined with specific charging control method, access to corresponding aggregating charging load model is available. The proposed method has been verified by simulation on an actual buses line with charging/swapping station. The results shows that the proposed method can grasp characteristics of EBs cluster's charging load under multiple factors, thereby improve the practicality and reliability of modeling.
To simplify the analysis, without considering dispatching of batteries, only Station C is taken as example in subsequent analyzes. And Station is set to be both a bus station and a charging/swapping station. Then the total modeling method is given as follows.
Firstly, according to scheduling information and driving route of a specific bus line, establish the general framework for total simulation. After that, using this framework and taking EBs' parameters into consideration, continuously track and simulate each EB's behavior. The tracking and simulating involve EB's departure, driving, returning, swapping batteries and parking, namely every segments of EB's behavior. Then, combined with corresponding traffic conditions and other information, the SOC and arriving time of each EB are available.
When an EB arrives Station C, whether it needs battery swapping service is determined by both of its subsequent driving demand and batteries' SOC. The information of batteries replaced, such as SOC and charging begin time, can be obtained in the process of simulation. Then total aggregating charging load of EBs can be obtained from the calculation of such information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>689F3426-2BF5-424D-9EA6-9805A3598089</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This outcome can provide guidance on aggregated charging of large group of EVs.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Procedural Simulation Method for Aggregated Charging Load Model of Electric Vehicle Cluster</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>Parking interval constraints should be considered first when EVs take part in peak-load regulation service. Then remaining SOC and spare SOC constraints should be considered. When EV user arrive the parking lot, he should offer remaining SOC and spare SOC date. If there is not enough remaining SOC, peak-load regulation will not work. If remaining SOC is higher than spare SOC, peak-load regulation range will be calculated. Finally EV discharging range should be in grid peak-load range to make the modulation best. The best discharging time interval for each EV is obtained, then it can obtain all EV discharging time intervals.
The basic principle of peak-load modulation strategy based on grid electrovalence is that, using high electrovalence range as discharging time interval under EV parking range and SOC constraints. First EV arriving time and leaving time should be determined based on EV parking data. Then making sure whether peak-load modulation should be done based on the current battery capacity and reserved capacity information. If it should do peak-load modulation, then making sure the total number of EV needed discharging. Finally sorting electrovalence in these ranges and choosing high electrovalence range to discharge.
Both peak-load modulation strategies require each EV operation data. These data can be obtained using Monte Carlo method. Each EV's discharging range can be determined by simulating EV's mileage information, reserved capacity information, remaining SOC information and arriving/leaving information.</gtr:description><gtr:id>36D368B3-23E8-425A-89B4-12C064371C9A</gtr:id><gtr:impact>This development can potentially been used in new V2G charging infrastructure.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Charging and discharging strategy of V2G parking lot charging station</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This new research platform provide powerful and flexible battery charging/discharging test under different environment (-20&amp;deg;C to 60&amp;deg;C). 15kw charging can provide up to 500v voltage and 90A charging current while the 10.5 inverter can accept up to 250v voltage and 210 discharging current.

Therefore, it is becoming an increasingly important issue to develop an effective charging strategy of EVs. Our study proposes a formulation for optimal charging schedule of EVs taking N-1 security constraints into account. Individual EV aggregator representing a cluster of controllable EVs is used to determine the optimal charging schedule, based on a three-level hierarchy. On the top level, the control center determines the EV charging strategy from the proposed optimal formulation, where voltage fluctuations of buses, power losses of networks, charging regulations of EVs are considered as multi-objective functions. At the middle level, the aggregators integrate EVs information such as state of charge (SOC) and charging demands, and transfer an equivalent model upstream to the control center. At the bottom level, the EVs parked in residential or commercial districts communicate with the aggregator, and each EV follows the schedule it receives until it is disconnected for its next trip
This study focuses on the transmission level to obtain a day-ahead schedule of EV aggregators for improving the system voltage profile and reducing the power loss. To reduce the computational burden, the Benders decomposition technique is introduced to partition the optimal charging model into a base-case master problem and a set of slave problems relevant to various contingencies. Case studies have been conducted on the New England 39-bus system, and the results verify the necessity of considering N-1 security constraints and the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</gtr:description><gtr:id>B7F16B74-AC0C-49A2-B593-DC43BE822BEB</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Potentially used for charging infrastructure design</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Optimal Charging of Electric Vehicles Considering Network Security Constraints Using Benders Decomposition</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>It is vital to model EV users' willingness, especially the household users', on purchase, travel and charging for the interactive simulation of an EV-involved system.

Together with other models to present the system, agent-based models will help simulate the human-involved system.
A decision problem mainly focuses on multiple characteristic factors. These factors may relatively independent but have different importance. A decision is made by comparing the psychological requirement with the product's feature on each factor in a sequence of their importance.
In order to build agents ruled by the decision modes, a series of random number filters are created to simulate the choices of respondents: an individual's decision is described as numbers randomly generated based on the choices' distribution on a single factor or a combination of factors. A setting in a vehicle configuration decide the corresponding filter's size. If the size is better (sometimes larger, sometimes smaller) than the random number in the same factor (group), then the result is a pass. The sequence to use filters will influence the use of joint distributions, therefore the result. If all filters are passed, then the individual agent is thought to have the purchase willingness on that vehicle type.</gtr:description><gtr:id>E8E847A0-F27B-4434-B9C1-F3535D672900</gtr:id><gtr:impact>A useful tool to gather information and the study can help manufacturers and policy makers to promote EVs.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Questionnaire survey for EV purchase willingness study</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:researchMaterialOutput><gtr:description>This is about the daily generation schedule of thermal power units considering differentiated environmental capacity margins of key area and differentiated coal consumption and emission levels of power unit. The optimization model of power dispatch is established, in which the total cost of coal, the total amount of emission, and the reduction of pollutants' concentration in key areas are taken as the objectives of expectation. Within the model, the calculation of the amount of the reduction on pollutants' concentration is based on Gaussian puff dispersion model, the weather forecast data and the predicted pollution levels in densely populated areas. The model is solved by steps and by sets. First, the basic generation schedule without environmental capacity margin constraints is solved. Second, under the basic schedule, the power units that contribute more to the environmental capacity in key areas under specific weather conditions are classified into subset1 and their power is to be reduced to meet the environmental requirements; other units which are less harmful to environment are classified into subset2 and their power is to be increased by an equal amount to meet power balance requirements. Third, by revising the schedule of the two subsets using Lagrange multiplier method, the differentiated daily generation schedule is formed. 
However, the spinning reserve of the system and the accommodation abilities of wind power can be changed because of the revision of the basic generation schedule. Therefore, a more complete generation schedule with second revision is proposed. After the first revision, if the spinning reserve of system is insufficient, the schedule will be revised for the second time to meet spinning reserve capacity requirements. Similarly, if the accommodation abilities of wind power are changed, the generation schedule of wind farm will also be adjusted.
Based on the first revision schedule, considering different possibilities of spinning reserve capacity and wind power consumption, 8 different situations are discussed for the second revision schedule. For each situation, after obtaining the total amount of adjustment of wind power and thermal power, the total amount is allocated to each unit with respect to different environmental capacity margins and different unit coal consumption levels. Finally, the schedule of second revision is solved by Lagrange multiplier method. 
Two practical examples are applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The simulation results prove that the differentiated power dispatch solution is valid on solving daily power generation schedule with consideration of environmental capacity margins of key area, wind power accommodation abilities and spinning reserve capacities. 
In the process of solving the daily power generation schedule, the forecasted net load data should be obtained based on the simulation of the power system containing renewable power resources and electric vehicle cluster charging loads.</gtr:description><gtr:id>AA0C947E-81FC-433D-8EDE-5BC4F8392AB1</gtr:id><gtr:impact>It provide useful information for charging infrastructure design.</gtr:impact><gtr:providedToOthers>false</gtr:providedToOthers><gtr:title>Differentiated power dispatch with environmental capacity margin constraints</gtr:title><gtr:type>Technology assay or reagent</gtr:type></gtr:researchMaterialOutput></gtr:researchMaterialOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutput><gtr:description>Point energy technology has been developed to offer low-cost component level energy monitoring, providing actionable insights that reduce energy costs and optimise manufacturing processes (http://www.pointenergy.org/).
