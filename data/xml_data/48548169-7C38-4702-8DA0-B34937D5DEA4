Current energy and chemical needs are met by the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, in the form of coal, petroleum and natural gas. Such resources are finite, are frequently found in politically unstable regions of the world, and their utilisation is having severe impacts on the climate, both through pollution and increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The key challenge facing the global community is, therefore, to maximize the use of sustainable sources of chemicals and of energy to safeguard the environment while ensuring that the latter do not detrimentally impact food supplies. In this regard, renewable sources of energy and chemicals will play an increasing role in the global primary energy supply. Accordingly, the UK government and others have set challenging targets for reductions in GHG in part by aiming to produce chemicals using biological routes. 

Traditional strategies adopted for chemical and biofuel generation via biological systems have been reliant on the conversion of the more tractable components of plant biomass (sugars and starch) into chemicals and fuels. The microbes employed ferment the easily accessible sugar and/or starch of plants, such as sugar cane or corn, and convert them into biofuels such as bioethanol. This has led to concerns over competition with use of these products as food, and a re-focussing of efforts on so-called 'second generation' biofuels. These are generated from cell wall material (lignocellulose) derived from non-food crops or agricultural wastes. However, lignocellulose is extremely resistant to being broken down into sugar. Overcoming this recalcitrance in a cost effective manner is proving extremely challenging. 

An alternative route would be to directly capture carbon, by harnessing the ability of certain bacteria to 'eat' single carbon gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Thus, for instance, such gases are injected into the liquid medium of fermentation vessels they are consumed by certain bacteria and converted into useful chemicals and fuels. Fortunately, gases such as CO are an abundant resource, and a waste product of industries such as steel manufacturing, oil refining and chemical production. Moreover, it can be readily generated in the form of Synthesis Gas ('Syngas'), by the gasification (heating) of forestry and agricultural residues, municipal waste and coal. By allowing the use of all these available low cost, non-food resources, such a process both overcomes the &amp;quot;Food versus Fuel&amp;quot; issues associated with traditional ethanol production, and circumvents many of the challenges associated with 'second generation' biofuels. Furthermore, capturing the large volume of CO (destined to become CO2 once released into the atmosphere) emitted by industry for fuel and chemical production provides a net reduction in fossil carbon emissions. 

There has been a global upsurge of interest both in studying the biology of those organisms able to grow on C1 gases, as well as commercially exploiting them as platforms for chemical manufacture. In this respect the UK lags disappointingly behind the curve. It is the objective of the C1NET to correct this deficiency by encouraging the creation of a vibrant community of UK academics tasked with unravelling the biological, chemical and process engineering aspects of gas fermentation and to steer the translational outputs of these endeavours towards commercial application. The network will provide the 'glue' to bring together a UK-based cadre of biologists, chemists, computational modellers/mathematicians and process engineers to better understand and thence exploit gas fermentation processes for translation into industry.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:technicalSummary>We will create a vibrant community of UK academics tasked with unravelling the biological, chemical and process engineering aspects of gas fermentation and to steer translational outputs towards commercial application through the following activities:-

SANDPIT EVENTS: organised to meet defied challenges set by C1NET MB, and which are periodically revised. Pump-priming projects aimed at proof of concept will be selected following review. 

WORKSHOPS: to provide training for PDRAs and PhD students in key enabling technologies, eg., gene transfer/ manipulation, genome-scale modelling and gas fermentation. 

ANNUAL MEETINGS: to showcase the activities of C1NET, inviting selected international experts to inform on the global perspective. 

JOINT EXPERIMENTS: on goal specific, strategic objectives will be funded between Network members, to support grant submissions in response to national and international calls.

COMMUNICATION: will be maintained through a website, providing updates and Case Studies on C1NET developments. A quarterly newsletter, and flyers will also be distributed at national and international meetings and by emailing. 

OUTREACH: we will promote and educate the wider scientific community, policy makers and society at large, to identify and foster relationships with key stakeholders who can assist in developing and promoting C1NET activities and outputs.

TRAINING: We will support and encourage the participation and development of the PDRAs and students of C1NET members, through presentation at conferences and participation in sandpits, workshops and joint experiments.

All of these aspects have been covered by the amassed Network membership of C1NET. New membership will be encouraged through the network activities (meetings, website, TSB Connect and through the NNFCC and KTNs) and representation at relevant trade meetings. We will also directly approach stakeholder groups and private sectors that we believe should be involved.</gtr:technicalSummary><gtr:potentialImpactText>Trends in capital investment within the chemicals sector suggests that the bulk and speciality chemicals sectors, both of which have traditionally been strengths of the UK production industry, are following the pharmaceuticals sector to SE Asia. If the UK is to remain competitive across the Bulk and Speciality chemicals sectors we must forge a new generation of processes with intrinsic emphasis on efficiency, process integration and resource management. Developing technology platforms with a reduced dependence on traditional petroleum based materials is acknowledged as the only long-term solution to sustainability. 

Looking at the local market rationale for this C1NET proposition, the chemical-using industries continue to be one of the strongest sectors of the UK economy, employing 230,000 highly skilled people, spending &amp;pound;3.5 billion on R&amp;amp;D and the UK's top manufacturing export earner. Its products are the basis for almost every manufacturing activity. However, it is also energy-intensive and almost totally dependent on imported petroleum as its basic raw material. It is vulnerable to rising global oil prices and disruption to global oil supplies. C1NET will strategically de-risk this reliance on petroleum, delivering supply chain security and reducing environmental. 

Almost every major chemical company has set ambitious targets to lower their carbon footprint, or even to become carbon neutral. To achieve this there must be re-alignment from fossil fuel dependencies and efficient use of carbon in its simplest forms, specifically of C1 gases that may be generated as by-products from other existing processes (CO, CO2 and CH4). 

Specifically C1NET will deliver impact in the following sectors:

ECONOMY: Sustainability is the major issue facing the global chemical industry. Not only is there concern for our environment, there is also is a strong economic driver. Shareholders place emphasis on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (http://www.sustainability-index.com that tracks the performance of the chemicals industry and engenders competition. A commitment to responsible innovation, and the application of SB as a key platform to products will secure the UK lead in innovation and chemicals production. 

PEOPLE: There is a clear and increasing demand for highly qualified technologists that are trained to lead innovation and manage the deployment of SB based techniques into industry. C1NET offers a market driven &amp;quot;shared vision&amp;quot; towards products and processes. It will deliver highly skilled individuals via the joint funding programmes and training that will be well placed to influence and manage the required change to sustainable working practices across chemical manufacturing industries.

SOCIETY: The diverse range of products manufactured by the chemical-using industries is vital to maintaining a high quality of life in the UK, C1NET will have a direct impact on this activity by ensuring a supply of people and new knowledge to secure sustainability of the sector for the benefit of all. The &amp;quot;green and sustainable&amp;quot; agenda is now firmly fixed in the public consciousness, C1NET will be an exemplar of how scientists and engineers can provide real solutions to very challenging scientific and technical problems, for the benefit of society

KNOWLEDGE: In addition to increasing the supply of highly trained people, the results of research performed C1NET will have a major impact on knowledge. C1NET researchers will tackle &amp;quot;big problems&amp;quot; in sustainable chemistry, and via our industrial partners we will ensure that new knowledge is applied in industry. Knowledge based activity will drive innovation and economic activity for UK PLC creating new jobs and securing the future.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2019-03-25</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7"><gtr:id>2512EF1C-401B-4222-9869-A770D4C5FAC7</gtr:id><gtr:name>BBSRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2014-03-26</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>642979</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs/><gtr:collaborationOutputs/><gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>C1net Conference 2016</gtr:description><gtr:form>Participation in an activity, workshop or similar</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>International</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>15717EEB-1405-4FA1-A9DA-8C911E4E4BF8</gtr:id><gtr:impact>The C1net conference gave us the opportunity to showcase the new 'Game of Fuels' which both the SBRC and C1net have developed as well as other demonstrations which we use for outreach.

Nottingham's contribution was the much anticipated &amp;quot;Secret Science Show&amp;quot; at Wollaton Hall, and taking part were C1net members Louise Dynes and Dr Vinod Kumar. Together they gave a presentation and interactive demonstration on 'the power of microbes' explaining how microbes can turn unwanted substances into useful ones such as plastics and fuels. Dr Kumar also explained and demonstrated how a bioreactor worked. The audience of 86, with an ages range from 6 to 60 participated enthusiastically in the Q&amp;amp;A session and left with the message that only a very small percentage of bacteria are bad and that many are useful .

FIRST&amp;reg; LEGO&amp;reg; League (FLL&amp;reg;) is a global science and technology competition with over 250,000 young people aged from 9 to 18 taking part each year. This is a global science and technology challenge for teams of students, to encourage an interest in real world issues and develop key skills that are crucial for their future careers. The students work together to explore a given topic and to design, build and program an autonomous LEGO robot to solve a series of missions.
Schools from around the East Midlands attended the event and as well as designing and building their project, there was an exhibition area for pupils to have a go at some table top outreach activities. 

The SBRC hosted some LEGO related activities including; building a bacterium from LEGO for the younger pupils and the older pupils had a go at designing plasmids using LEGO. Louise Dynes, SBRC Outreach Officer who organised the SBRC stand said 'LEGO is a great way of teaching microbiology to pupils, particularly building plasmids! I would like to thank everyone who helped out and made this day a success!' 

some of the older pupils who took part in the plasmid building were interested in doing more work around plasmids and would like more information and or us to come into their school/college.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Schools</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:year>2016</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:disseminationOutput><gtr:description>Pub PhD - Public Talk Nottingham</gtr:description><gtr:form>A talk or presentation</gtr:form><gtr:geographicReach>Regional</gtr:geographicReach><gtr:id>97E2C0E9-3DD6-4B99-82B4-62A7AB2B9E9D</gtr:id><gtr:impact>10 minute talk and 20 minutes Q&amp;amp;A session, included questions about first and second generation biofuels, genetic modification, how deleting genes can improve an bacterium, economy of the biofuel problems, Lanzatech and other companies, the genetics of the organism and other questions about the bacteria and research undertaken at UoN.

Current energy and chemical needs are largely met by the extraction and processing of the fossil fuels oil, gas and coal. Such resources are limited and their use causes environmental pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The challenge facing humankind is, therefore, to identify new, sustainable and cleaner processes for chemical and energy generation.
Solar power, wind power and water power are three of many alternative technologies which help supply our demand for energy, but they cannot provide for all our needs are not currently a viable option for a car or a plane and cannot be converted into the many chemicals we take for granted.
To maintain our lifestyle, at least in the short-term, we need clean, sustainable, transportable, liquid fuels and biofuels have come to our rescue. CURRENT biofuels (e.g. Bioethanol and Biodiesel) allow us to grow our fuel by recycling atmospheric carbon dioxide (photosynthesis), so reducing greenhouse emissions and our reliance on a finite resource. They now play a major role especially in the US and Brazil. But they are not without their critics as they use land which could be used for food and remain carbon positive (produce more atmospheric carbon than they use). This has stimulated scientific research to develop an array of ADVANCED Fuels. The most exciting of these comes from an unlikely source a &amp;quot;gas eating microbe&amp;quot; 
Certain microbes can grow on C1 gases carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) &amp;amp; hydrogen (H2) and convert them into useful chemical and fuels. There has been a global upsurge of interest in studying the biology of these organisms and commercially exploiting them as platforms for chemical manufacture. Companies like LanzaTech, Coskata, Ineos-Bios, Evonik, Lanxess and Genencor are all active in this area but the UK overall lags behind. 
C1net has the potential to contribute to:
1. Fostering the economic performance of UK companies in the world arena:
- Creating jobs
- Exporting scientific expertise and technology

2. Maintaining and enhancing quality of life on a global scale:
- Providing a sustainable and secure energy supply
- Producing a truly carbon neutral ADVANCED &amp;quot;biofuel&amp;quot;
- Permitting us to continue to enjoy an array of chemicals in a post petroleum world.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2014</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>15CDD3C4-4562-48B2-95E9-FF1A2A62EAA0</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Economic,Policy &amp; public services</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Chemicals,Energy,Environment,Manufacturing, including Industrial Biotechology</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>C1net www.c1net.co.uk is a BBSRC-NIBB network which champions research into the use of &amp;quot;gas-eating&amp;quot; microbes to ferment polluting greenhouse gases (CO, CO2 &amp;amp; CH4) from landfill and industry, into useful products e.g. biofuels and plastics.
C1net is dedicated to the development and scalable production of C1 gas fermentation for the whole IB community. It provides a cross-sector forum with the goals to foster and enhance collaboration between industry and academia; develop skills and expertise; share best practice; define common research priorities; and target funding opportunities in C1 gas fermentation. The management board is currently 11 strong, with Professor Nigel Minton (University of Nottingham) as PI and Professor Davis Fell (Oxford Brookes) as CoI.
Membership currently stands at 279, with members from Europe, India, Israel, Taiwan, USA and Russia. Industrial members number 66 from a total of 39 different companies; and we have 229 followers on Twitter. A total of 8 POC awards of &amp;pound;50,000 each have now been made, but so far only one has completed and reported (see link below). 3 of these POCs involve academia/industry collaborations ( University of Dundee &amp;amp; Ingenza; University of Nottingham &amp;amp; Sasol; University of Nottingham &amp;amp; Green Biologics/Calysta/Lanzatech 1 BIV (University of Kent &amp;amp; Zuvasyntha) has also been award, but has not yet completed.

To date C1net industry/academia networking events include: 8 newsletters, 1 international conference, 2 funding events, and 1 industry scoping workshop (run jointly with BBSRC-NIBB &amp;quot;Metals in Biology&amp;quot;). Understanding the importance of training the next generation C1net has run 2 practical workshops. It also takes its public outreach duties seriously and so far has participated in 20 events, including Open days, Caf&amp;eacute; Scientifique, Pub PhD, Big Bang, European Science Parliament and a work experience placement.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The aim of C1net is to help stimulate industry/academia interaction in C1 gas fermentation by providing networking events and funding opportunities. The networking events (International conference, funding events and scoping workshop) have brought together a total of 201 scientists, 144 from academia and 57 from industry, from which 8 collaborative POC projects have emerged.
Scientists regularly report that that there is &amp;quot;there is clearly an understanding gap between academics and industry&amp;quot; (Ying Zhang, University of Nottingham). C1net fills this gap, as Tom Smith - Professor, Sheffield Hallam explains &amp;quot;One of the strengths of C1net is that it brings together academics and people from industry and has made me aware of the extent of industrial interest in C1net and also has shaped future research plans for my group in recognising major challenges for the commercial sector&amp;quot;. William Gabrielli - Principal Scientist, Sasol goes further &amp;quot;We have further found exposure to the research of leading academics in Europe and UK as key in understanding the major challenges faced in commercialising gas fermentation technology. 

That C1net is creating the optimal conditions for fostering future collaborations is exemplified by 3 important companies in this arena: Arild Johannessen - Vice President, Nutrition, Calysta, Norway, reports &amp;quot;C1 net has given Calysta access to an important new platform for networking within the C1 gaseous fermentation area. so far this work has resulted in one project within systems biology in cooperation with Chain biotechnology and Synthetic Biology Research Centre, and one application to EU for a C1 platform&amp;quot;. William Gabrielli - Principal Scientist, Sasol states &amp;quot;Through creating a platform for discussions with other industrial partners, Sasol has further developed a 12 month project with one of the partners in C1 net&amp;quot;. Fraser Brown - Team Leader, Ingenza Ltd adds &amp;quot;Promoting discussion between different disciplines generated some interesting proof of concept studies which may provide the basis for further development of these projects into larger integrated grant proposals. 

In the final report C1net's first completed POC &amp;quot;Metabolic modelling to support synthetic biology in C1Net organism M. capsulatus&amp;quot;, Andrzej M. Kierzek University of Surrey explains how his research will go further &amp;quot;The preliminary data obtained in this project will be used to write BBRSC grant on the growth rate optimisation of M. capsulatus. The Surrey FBA software has been already used for analysis of transposon mutagenesis data. We will perform transposon screens on M. capsulatus to validate metabolic model and use it to optimise strains and media for biomass production.&amp;quot;</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>2EC9514A-EC1D-45F8-9552-E343E17E7906</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.c1net.co.uk/Public%20Summaries/POC-2-kierzek-C1net-public-summary-report.pdf</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications/><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">BB/L013800/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>17F21DBC-4946-4262-AD07-9914F6EA12F7</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioengineering</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>2607D197-52EE-40CA-A1D5-A46D18C3F97F</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microbial sciences</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>649031FD-C21E-42D9-AC12-41ACA59CC11C</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Biochemistry &amp; physiology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>68D4AB6A-88C3-4368-8A94-2DADEEF21FF5</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Bioenergy</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>75BBF8D4-D2E9-4106-B484-743614789AF9</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Microorganisms</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
