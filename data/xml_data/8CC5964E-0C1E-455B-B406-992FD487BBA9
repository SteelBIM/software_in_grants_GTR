Volunteering has been heralded by the Coalition Government as a key ingredient of the Big Society. Vivid in people's memory remains the London Olympics 2012, an event which has highlighted the crucial role played by volunteers. Despite such success stories, critics point to the fact that volunteering remains a minority activity (see Mycock and Tonge, 2011). It has, for example, been calculated that only 39 per cent of adults took part in some form of volunteering in 2011 (The European Volunteering Year), the lowest level since 2001, according to the Government's annual Citizenship Survey (Whitehead, 2011). 

Also, it has been argued that governmental and institutional discourses of volunteering do not always account for grass roots experiences of volunteering. Rather they are premised on the assumption that there is an unlimited reservoir of goodwill in communities and people can be encouraged to volunteer more. There is also a sense that volunteering is being promoted as a means to promote a rebalancing of society away from the state and as a way of reducing the cost of welfare service provision and public spending (Seddon, 2007; Rosol, 2012). 

Governmental discourses, we argue, fail to do justice to the diverse forms of volunteering and the motives, practices and affective relations involved in volunteering. Furthermore, there appears to be few avenues for alternative discourses of volunteering to emerge, with official discourses of volunteering tending to neglect, marginalise or overlook voices coming from below. 

In this project, we capture such voices by engaging with three types of volunteers: voluntary volunteers, instrumental volunteers, and voluntolds (people who are forced to volunteer) from the Stoke-on-Trent area. Stoke-on-Trent is a deprived area which relies heavily on volunteers to support many of its economic, social and cultural activities.

Working closely with volunteers, community organisations and policy makers we will co-develop a methodology by which the untold stories of volunteering will be heard at both local and national level. We do so with the help of cultural animation techniques. Culturally animating a community involves acknowledging and critically approaching existing power and knowledge hierarchies and taking steps to minimise them, as a means to developing more interpretative and less legislative approaches to understanding and working with communities (Phillips, 1998a; 1998b; 2002). This project will be constructed in a trans-disciplinary manner, with academics and their collaborating partners working together across its constituent elements of co-creation, co-design and co-production.

The main outcome of Phase 1 will be the development of a methodology detailing the stages and processes by which the team will co-produce and co-deliver a documentary drama on the untold stories of volunteering in Phase 2. We (volunteers, academics and policy makers) will all be actors in the documentary drama. We aim to co-deliver the documentary drama in at least three different localities across the UK. After each show, there will be a question and answer session to assess the degree to which the performance resonated or not with the audience's own experiences of volunteering. Our community partner, New Vic Borderlines, has over 20 years experience in documentary theatre and is the holder of many national awards.</gtr:abstractText><gtr:potentialImpactText>The project will make an impact by:

1. enhancing understanding and knowledge of volunteering in society to ensure that volunteering is fully valued and recognised;
2. contributing to local debates about cultural regeneration by providing a forum for volunteers to discuss and reflect on their own experiences and contributions to the life of local communities;
3. contributing to public policy debates on volunteering at a local, regional and national level;
4. enthusing community members to embrace voluntary volunteering;
5. promoting a powerful methodology for co-designing and co-producing knowledge with local communities;
6. turning the untold stories of volunteering into public resources available to the general public, academics, policy makers and other relevant stakeholders;
7. helping organisations relying on volunteers to be more effective in their recruitment and retention of volunteers;
8. changing public opinion with regards to 'voluntolds' (people forced to volunteer).

We will contribute to policy debates by identifying and engaging with policy makers, advocacy organisations and umbrella organisations at all stages of the research. We will work closely with NCVO (National Council of Voluntary Organisations) which is in the process of merging with Volunteering England. Other stakeholders include, CSV, Vinspired, Timebank, the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Office for Civil Society and experienced community activists who will help us develop policy guidelines.

Community practitioners will benefit from an improved understanding of co-design, co-creation and co-production methodologies and may find the techniques of cultural animation useful in 'animating' their local communities to increase participation of hard-to-reach groups in community-led initiatives. This will ensure that any state intervention to increase volunteering activity at local, regional and national levels can be achieved more effectively. 

Our final beneficiary will be the volunteers and their local communities. We plan to perform the documentary drama in communal venues in at least three localities across the UK, for example, New Vic Theatre, Newcastle-under-Lyme, the Richard Attenborough Centre for Disability and the Arts, University of Leicester and a London venue yet to be identified. Volunteers, academics and policy makers will act in the performance, thus ensuring it is truly co-delivered. After each show there will be a question and answer session to assess the degree to which the performance resonated or not with the audience's own experience of volunteering.</gtr:potentialImpactText><gtr:fund><gtr:end>2014-07-03</gtr:end><gtr:funder url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/organisation/1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9"><gtr:id>1291772D-DFCE-493A-AEE7-24F7EEAFE0E9</gtr:id><gtr:name>AHRC</gtr:name></gtr:funder><gtr:start>2013-02-04</gtr:start><gtr:type>INCOME_ACTUAL</gtr:type><gtr:valuePounds>99482</gtr:valuePounds></gtr:fund><gtr:output><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutputs><gtr:artisticAndCreativeProductOutput><gtr:description>As part of celebratory activities for Volunteers' Week, you are invited to come along to our interactive documentary drama about Untold Stories of volunteering which will be performed on stage by volunteers rather than actors. Under the sponsorship of the Arts and Humanities Research Council, The New Vic Theatre (Newcastle under Lyme) has teamed up with Keele and Leicester Universities and NCVO (National Council of Voluntary Organisations) to create with members of our communities a moving performance about the role of volunteering in our society. The drama explores the emotions, aspirations and frustrations the volunteer encounters on this journey towards better society.

The installation contained a projection of Peter Rice's mural, Bridgewater artefacts, ordinary day to day objects, empty frames, voice overs and musical documentaries made by diverse communities which took part in previous CASIC research projects. Using Cultural Animation techniques of community engagement and knowledge co-production pioneered in the UK by Sue Moffat, Founding Director of New Vic Borderlines and developed further via the Connected Communities research, participants were encouraged to create and visualise a bright future for Stoke on Trent by filling empty frames with their own ideas and aspirations, drawing themselves in the projection, imagining conversations that will take place in the future, and writing haikus and cinquans about their aspirations, wishes and ambitions for Stoke on Trent. This living and interactive installation acted as a bridge between past, present and future and as a boundary object that can unite communities around ideas about the future.
On November, 23rd, a steady stream of community members, students and staff came to visit the CASIC installation and take part in interactive workshops. Four theatre practitioners from the New Vic Boderlines encouraged participants to paint tea towels in the Pat Albeck's tradition, write haikus about their relationship with Stoke on Trent and put themselves in the projection of a mural by Peter Rice entitled 'A Bright Past for Stoke-on-Trent'. The discussions about Stoke and its impact on one's individual and collective identity have been fascinating. The created artifacts have been added to the installation and captured in picture and video form.</gtr:description><gtr:id>70F79C92-B660-472A-BBEE-0E18D00EA3AF</gtr:id><gtr:impact>Change of views regarding the past and present of Stoke on Trent

Professor David Shepherd, the Dean of the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences welcomed the participants and gave a short overview of CASIC, re-iterating the centrality of community based research and knowledge co-production, to the strategic plan of the University. His welcome address was followed by a talk given by CASIC Director, Professor Mihaela Kelemen (KMS), who emphasised that the main ambitions of CASIC are to dissolve the boundaries between academia and its wider community and to embrace a way of working and researching that recognises that common-sense, experience and day to day creativity are as important as academic expertise in the pursuit of truth and knowledge. Sue Moffat, Director of New Vic Borderlines, invited participants to experience Cultural Animation Methodologies of knowledge co-production and community engagement. Some groups wrote and performed cinquains about community and research, whilst others worked together to create an installation by using ordinary objects, items, small frames and large frames to explore ways &amp;quot;to improve the social conditions of individuals and their communities through the application of knowledge that is co-created&amp;quot;. Participants were also invited to contribute haikus that expressed their own personal aspirations regarding CASIC to the 'Tree of life' while other participants experienced the 'Button exercise'. Buttons that represented The University and its Community had to be sorted as finely as possible, categorised and labelled with the view to create a map of the relationships that currently existed and then participants had to redraw an ideal version of the relationships and a CASIC charter. The CASIC launch ended with a collective reflective process and a discussion about plans for future events.</gtr:impact><gtr:partOfOfficialScheme>false</gtr:partOfOfficialScheme><gtr:primaryAudience>Public/other audiences</gtr:primaryAudience><gtr:url>https://www.keele.ac.uk/casic/casicinternallaunch/</gtr:url><gtr:year>2015</gtr:year></gtr:disseminationOutput></gtr:disseminationOutputs><gtr:exploitationOutputs/><gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>13000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Festival 2015</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-12-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>D4B6D474-21EA-40C2-B9B6-1C60551E26D9</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-03-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>23000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>EPSRC Community and Culture Network</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-09-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>C3A3AFC0-9C16-4974-AB7E-FE8F46C2CF86</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-09-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>7000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Scale and growth Award</gtr:description><gtr:end>2016-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>NIHR/HEFCE Higher Education Fund for England</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>30CC4CC9-E5E1-4637-916A-77E31CA67665</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2015-04-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>16000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>Connected Communities Cardiff Festival</gtr:description><gtr:end>2015-03-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A0D0E7F8-36F3-4D96-9F26-5A2F9A4D43DB</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Public</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2014-06-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:furtherFundingOutput><gtr:amountPounds>40000</gtr:amountPounds><gtr:country>United Kingdom of Great Britain &amp; Northern Ireland (UK)</gtr:country><gtr:currCode>GBP</gtr:currCode><gtr:currCountryCode>United Kingdom</gtr:currCountryCode><gtr:currLang>en_GB</gtr:currLang><gtr:description>early career Leverhulme fellowship</gtr:description><gtr:end>2019-08-02</gtr:end><gtr:fundingOrg>The Leverhulme Trust</gtr:fundingOrg><gtr:id>A8995C95-6725-4B31-92BF-5A05F134FE99</gtr:id><gtr:sector>Academic/University</gtr:sector><gtr:start>2016-10-01</gtr:start></gtr:furtherFundingOutput></gtr:furtherFundingOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:impactSummaryOutput><gtr:description>The findings have been used by academics, community groups, charity and umbrella organisations to clarify roles, policies, structures, training, support and communication with respect to volunteering.</gtr:description><gtr:firstYearOfImpact>2015</gtr:firstYearOfImpact><gtr:id>DA848F07-5D5B-4F29-8865-B2B1A226566F</gtr:id><gtr:impactTypes><gtr:impactType>Societal</gtr:impactType></gtr:impactTypes><gtr:sector>Communities and Social Services/Policy</gtr:sector></gtr:impactSummaryOutput></gtr:impactSummaryOutputs><gtr:intellectualPropertyOutputs/><gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:description>The project's aim was to give voice to untold stories of volunteering by employing a cultural animation methodology to ensure that such stories are co-designed and co-produced with and by volunteers and other interested stakeholders. The project had two phases. In the first phase, we worked closely with volunteers from Staffordshire and other stakeholders involved in volunteering, particularly the New Vic Theatre and NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations) to co-design a cultural animation methodology in order to explore volunteering experiences from multiple perspectives and uncover untold stories of volunteering. In a series of cultural animation workshops, participants explored volunteering through the creation of songs, plays, puppets and human tableaux. Drawing on the themes developed in Phase 1, we broadened the stakeholder community in Phase 2 to include a large spectrum of volunteers from around the UK, umbrella groups, support organisations and local government. The project concluded with the performance of an interactive documentary drama entitled Untold Stories of Volunteering which was co-designed, co-produced and co-performed by participants in venues based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Leicester and London.</gtr:description><gtr:exploitationPathways>The legacy of 'Untold Stories of Volunteering' is multifaceted. At an individual level, the cultural animation exercises have changed the way participants think about each other's aspirations and agendas providing new skills that are useful in community work and also in teaching. This project refines the on-going work New Vic Borderlines is doing with marginalised categories of people in our society, strengthens Keele University and Leicester University's agenda of community leadership and community sustainability and provides evidence for NCVO to influence government and other umbrella organisations on issues which are central to volunteering. The study accessed stories of volunteering from the 'voluntolds', a marginalised category whose voice is hardly represented or accounted for in the academic literature or the policy making debates, and challenged taken for granted views about existing motivations and rationales for volunteering. The project contributes a methodological legacy to academic studies on volunteering advancing a unique understanding about how volunteering practices condition and are conditioned by the wider social practices and relations in which they are located.</gtr:exploitationPathways><gtr:id>DD61D18D-A2F7-4B22-8AB1-6CF08ADEB3B1</gtr:id><gtr:sectors><gtr:sector>Chemicals</gtr:sector></gtr:sectors><gtr:url>http://www.keele.ac.uk/volunteeringstories/</gtr:url></gtr:keyFindingsOutput><gtr:otherResearchOutputs/><gtr:policyInfluenceOutputs/><gtr:productOutputs/><gtr:researchDatabaseAndModelOutputs/><gtr:researchMaterialOutputs/><gtr:softwareAndTechnicalProductOutputs/><gtr:spinOutOutputs/></gtr:output><gtr:publications><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/44843313-DE69-4C87-8797-4D52A2BA0113"><gtr:id>44843313-DE69-4C87-8797-4D52A2BA0113</gtr:id><gtr:title>Evaluating the Legacy of Animative and Iterative Connected Communities Projects: Relections on Methodological Legacies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/6fc8cd41e78c1a7ed1648b8a50e29257"><gtr:id>6fc8cd41e78c1a7ed1648b8a50e29257</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>James, D</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/283B71A3-465E-465B-A17A-E89218F23BBD"><gtr:id>283B71A3-465E-465B-A17A-E89218F23BBD</gtr:id><gtr:title>Boat, Tree, Game, Buttons: How ordinary objects can spark extraordinary change</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/dfb0a65001570710a874cda47624e676"><gtr:id>dfb0a65001570710a874cda47624e676</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Steele, J</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2015-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/9F7EBF41-BC79-4D18-9108-7B280E8E2848"><gtr:id>9F7EBF41-BC79-4D18-9108-7B280E8E2848</gtr:id><gtr:title>Pictures of Health: Unearthing Community Hidden Assets Using Cultural Animation Methodologies</gtr:title><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/91e5136d90c09a9c7339f1c7e1dc90c3"><gtr:id>91e5136d90c09a9c7339f1c7e1dc90c3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Kelemen, M</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2014-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication><gtr:publication url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/publication/2927911B-7F09-4B09-84DF-9D4EC257D8F6"><gtr:id>2927911B-7F09-4B09-84DF-9D4EC257D8F6</gtr:id><gtr:title>The role of community leadership in disaster recovery projects: Tsunami lessons from Japan</gtr:title><gtr:parentPublicationTitle>International Journal of Project Management</gtr:parentPublicationTitle><gtr:authors><gtr:author url="http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk:80/person/df1446d37ddbc9ae923008079c6a1ce3"><gtr:id>df1446d37ddbc9ae923008079c6a1ce3</gtr:id><gtr:otherNames>Lin Y</gtr:otherNames></gtr:author></gtr:authors><gtr:date>2016-01-01</gtr:date></gtr:publication></gtr:publications><gtr:identifiers><gtr:identifier type="RCUK">AH/K006576/1</gtr:identifier></gtr:identifiers><gtr:healthCategories/><gtr:researchActivities/><gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>38E9B207-EFC4-4B48-AF70-C67AC5978934</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Drama &amp; theatre studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>5E9AA4EC-49E3-4D6A-B545-79DA07CE39E0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Management &amp; Business Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>946C0541-464B-43A5-9EE3-65C23360E959</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Philosophy</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject><gtr:researchSubject><gtr:id>F0322ED6-113F-4530-BA5E-562216587E68</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Sociology</gtr:text></gtr:researchSubject></gtr:researchSubjects><gtr:researchTopics><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>ABBA5192-0B16-4BC8-8B3F-3A48625872F0</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Cultural Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>E24DFBD1-65CA-4C0A-ABA6-58F8F129200B</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Ethics</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>4FE4E471-D6BD-451C-B7BE-F13520DD3883</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Organisational Studies</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>9BB7B92A-CA2F-416A-8A6C-ED65BF575E45</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Performance &amp; Live Art</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic><gtr:researchTopic><gtr:id>020361E1-B8CA-49FD-9149-27D31D21C7A3</gtr:id><gtr:percentage>0</gtr:percentage><gtr:text>Social Anthropology</gtr:text></gtr:researchTopic></gtr:researchTopics><gtr:rcukProgrammes/></gtr:project></gtr:projectComposition></gtr:projectOverview>
